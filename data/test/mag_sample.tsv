2055207683	Protein-L-isoaspartate (D-aspartate) O-methyltransferases (EC 2.1.1.77) that catalyze the transfer of methyl groups from S-adenosylmethionine to abnormal L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues in a variety of peptides and proteins are widely distributed in procaryotes and eucaryotes. These enzymes participate in the repair of spontaneous protein damage by facilitating the conversion of L-isoaspartyl and D-aspartyl residues to normal L-aspartyl residues. In this work, we have identified an L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase activity in Arabidopsis thaliana, a dicotyledonous plant of the mustard family. The highest levels of activity were detected in seeds. Using degenerate oligonucleotides corresponding to two highly conserved amino acid regions shared among the Escherichia coli, wheat, and human enzymes, we isolated and sequenced a full-length genomic clone encoding the A. thaliana methyltransferase. Several methyltransferase cDNAs were also characterized, including ones that would encode full-length polypeptides of 230 amino acid residues. Messenger RNAs for the A. thaliana enzyme were found in a variety of tissues that did not contain significant amounts of active enzyme suggesting the possibility of translational or posttranslational controls on methyltransferase levels. We have identified a putative abscisic acid-response element (ABRE) in the 5′-untranslated region of the A. thaliana L-isoaspartyl methyltransferase gene and have shown that the expression of the mRNA is responsive to exogenous abscisic acid (ABA), but not to the environmental stresses of salt or drought. The expression of the A. thaliana enzyme appears to be regulated in a distinct fashion from that seen in wheat or in animal tissues.
2055207697	Deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs), capable of removing ubiquitin (Ub) from protein substrates, are involved in numerous biological processes. The ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) subfamily of DUBs consists of four members: UCH-L1, UCH-L3, UCH37 and BRCA1-associated protein-1 (BAP1). UCH-L1 possesses deubiquitinating activity and dimerization-dependent ubiquitin ligase activity, and functions as a mono-ubiquitin stabilizer; UCH-L3 does both deubiquitinating and deneddylating activity, except dimerization or ligase activity, and unlike UCH-L1, can interact with Lys48-linked Ub dimers to protect it from degradation and in the meanwhile to inhibit its hydrolase activity; UCH37 is responsible for the deubiquitinating activity in the 19S proteasome regulatory complex, and as indicated by the recent study, UCH37 is also associated with the human Ino80 chromatin-remodeling complex (hINO80) in the nucleus and can be activated via transient association of 19S regulatory particle- or proteasome-bound hRpn13 with hINO80; BAP1, binding to the wild-type BRCA1 RING finger domain, is regarded as a tumor suppressor, but for such suppressing activity, as demonstrated otherwise, both deubiquitinating activity and nucleus localization are required. There is growing evidence that UCH enzymes and human malignancies are closely correlated. Previous studies have shown that UCH enzymes play a crucial role in some signalings and cell-cycle regulation. In this review, we provided an insight into the relation between UCH enzymes and oncogenesis.
2055207701	Abstract Lake Trout Salvelinus namaycush were extirpated from Lake Michigan by the early 1950s, and as part of an effort to restore naturally reproducing populations, hatchery-reared fish have been stocked since the early 1960s. Stocked fish are marked with a fin clip to differentiate them from wild, lake-produced Lake Trout; marking error for the 2007–2010 year-classes of Lake Trout stocked by federal hatcheries averaged 3.0%. Egg deposition, emergent fry, and wild juvenile Lake Trout have previously been observed, but no sustained wild recruitment has been measured in assessment surveys or in sport and commercial fishery catches. In 2011 and 2012, we caught juvenile Lake Trout in gill-net and bottom trawl catches that were targeting Bloater Coregonus hoyi in water depths greater than 80 m. Unclipped, wild Lake Trout represented 20% of all Lake Trout caught in a southern offshore region of Lake Michigan. In northwestern Lake Michigan wild recruits represented from 10% to 27% of the 2007–2009 year-classes...
2055207765	In a previous study, we observed increased protective activity against acid precipitation of poly (U) in the serum of tumor bearing mice and hepatoma patients. In the present study we purified and partially characterized the protein responsible for this phenomenon and measured the activity in the serum of patients with various cancers. Evidence is presented that this protein forms a complex with serum ribonucleases which results in the inactivation of enzymes and protection of RNA from acid precipitation. The serum protective activity against acid precipitation of poly (U) was measured in 37 patients with gastrointestinal cancer and 79 with gynecological cancer, along with 15 male subjects with nonmalignant diseases of the gastrointestinal system, 15 with uterine leiomyoma, 19 healthy men and 30 healthy women from the hospital personnel. The mean values found in patients with various tumors were about three times higher than those found in healthy individuals, while no significant overlapping of values was observed between cancer patients and controls. On the other hand, the activity was not increased in patients with nonmalignant diseases of gastrointestinal system and uterus.
2055207790	Matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), referred to as collagenase-3, is a proteolytic enzyme that plays a key role in degradation and remodelling of host extracellular matrix proteins. The objective of this study was to characterize the MMP-13 gene in channel catfish, and to determine its pattern of expression in various healthy tissues and during embryogenesis. Since MMP-13 has been shown to have importance in tissue remodelling and some pathological processes, we further studied its involvement in the defense responses of catfish after bacterial infection. The channel catfish MMP-13 cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1416 bp encoding 471 amino acids. Using RT-PCR analysis, MMP-13 was widely expressed in various health tissues. Using quantitative real-time PCR analysis, expression of MMP-13 gene was up-regulated by bacterial infection. During normal embryological development, MMP-13 expression was slightly increased in the first day post-fertilization and sharply up-regulated from 1-day post-fertilization through hatching.
2055207792	Among the modes of transmission available to the cytomegalovirus (CMV) is sexual transmission, primarily via semen. Both male-to-female (M-F) and male-to-male (M-M) sexual transmission significantly contribute toward the spread of CMV infections in the global population. Semen plays an important role in carrying the viral particle that invades the vaginal or rectal mucosa, thereby initiating viral replication. Both semen and seminal plasma (SP) can enhance HIV-1 infection in cell culture, and two amyloid fibrils, semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI) and amyloids derived from the semenogelins (SEM amyloids), have been identified as seminal factors sufficient to enhance HIV-1 infection (J. Munch et al., Cell 131:1059-1071, 2007; N. R. Roan et al., Cell Host Microbe 10:541-550, 2011; F. Arnold et al., J. Virol. 86:1244-1249, 2012). Whether SP, SEVI, or SEM amyloids can enhance other viral infections has not been extensively examined. In this study, we found that SP, SEVI, and SEM amyloids strongly enhance both human CMV (HCMV) and murine CMV infection in cell culture. SEVI and SEM amyloids increased infection rates by >10-fold, as determined by both flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy. Viral replication was increased by 50- to 100-fold. Moreover, viral growth curve assays showed that SP, SEVI, and SEM amyloids sped up the kinetics of CMV replication such that the virus reached its replicative peak more quickly. Finally, we discovered that SEM amyloids and SEVI counteracted the effect of anti-gH in protecting against CMV infection. Collectively, the data suggest that semen enhances CMV infection through interactions between semen amyloid fibrils and viral particles, and these interactions may prevent HCMV from being neutralized by anti-gH antibody.
2055207797	Abstract During HIV infection, CD4 + -cell numbers and CD4/CD8 ratios decline in the blood. This is usually attributed to direct viral killing or to other indirect mechanisms. However, current models generally assume that such changes in the blood are representative of changes in total CD4 + -cell numbers throughout the body. This article discusses the importance of alterations in CD4 + - and CD8 + -cell migration in regulating blood lymphocyte levels and questions the extent of virus-mediated CD4 + -cell destruction.
2055207891	Summary  A mass emergence of Chironomus anthracinus (Zetterstedt) took place at Loch Leven, Kinross, in late May and early June 1971, leading to a large concentration of egg masses. The distribution of egg masses within the lake was determined on 6 June 1971 and the accumulation of egg masses along wind-exposed shores, under the influence of a 17–23 km h−1 wind, was noted. Oviposition site selection by the weak flying adults appears to have little importance upon the final distribution of larvae within the lake. Temporary planktonic activity of first instar larvae under the influence of wind-induced water currents is briefly discussed as a dispersal mechanism in the light of observed egg mass accumulation in the lake.
2055207899	We used a modified functional balance (FB) model to predict growth response of Helianthus annuus L. to elevated CO2. Model predictions were evaluated against measurements obtained twice during the experiment. There was a good agreement between model predictions of relative growth rate (RGR) responses to elevated CO2and observations, particularly at the second harvest. The model was then used to compare the relative effects of biomass allocation to roots, nitrogen (N) uptake and photosynthetic N-use efficiency (PNUE) in determining plant growth response to elevated CO2. The model predicted that a rather substantial increase in biomass allocation to root growth had little effect on whole plant growth response to elevated CO2, suggesting that plasticity in root allocation is relatively unimportant in determining growth response. Average N uptake rate at elevated compared to ambient CO2was decreased by 21–29%. In contrast, elevated CO2increased PNUE by approx. 50% due to a corresponding rise in the CO2-saturation factor for carboxylation at elevated CO2. The model predicted that the decreased N uptake rate at elevated CO2lowered RGR modestly, but this effect was counterbalanced by an increase in PNUE resulting in a positive CO2effect on growth. Increased PNUE may also explain why in many experiments elevated CO2enhances biomass accumulation despite a significant drop in tissue nitrogen concentration. The formulation of the FB model as presented here successfully predicted plant growth responses to elevated CO2. It also proved effective in resolving which plant properties had the greatest leverage on such responses.
2055207902	Abstract The physical state of Epstein Barr virus (EBV) DNA was analyzed in the Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) cell line BL60 and in the autologous EBV-immortalized lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) IARC 277 by Gardella gel analysis, Southern blotting, and nonradioactive in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosomes. Although only episomal viral DNA was detected in the LCL, the 6–12 copies of EBV DNA in the BL cell line are integrated in one site of the host cell genome. The integration site is located near the breakpoint of a translocation 11;19 which is present in this cell line in addition to the BL-specific t(8;22).
2055207912	Abstract Malnutrition from the last week of gestation resulted in significant diminution in weight and total protein content of cerebral cortex of 12- and 24-day-old rats. In synaptosomal fractions from cerebral cortices of 24-day-old malnourished rats the recovery of protein and of acetylcholinesterase and choline acetyltransferase activity per gram of fresh tissue was higher than in the controls. Quantitative morphologic studies showed no difference in the composition of synaptosomal fractions from malnourished and control rats. The higher yield in protein. AChE and ChAc of synaptosome fractions may indicate that presynaptic endings are relatively spared by perinatal malnutrition, however, the possibility that these results are due to an altered distribution of the presynaptic endings among the various subcellular fractions cannot be ruled out.
2055207919	Depuis 1991 on a signale dans differents pays europeens l'existence d'une resistance de Varroa jacobsoni aux pyrethrinoides. Afin de localiser les regions ou l'acarien est devenu resistant, on a entrepris en Europe des etudes de surveillance en 1995, 1996 et 1997 a l'aide du test de laboratoire decrit par Milani [13]. Des echantillons d'acariens vivants ont ete preleves et leur sensibilite au τ-fluvalinate analysee. Les acariens ont ete laisses en contact avec des concentrations connues de τ-fluvalinate dans de la paraffine durant 6 h et la mortalite a 24 et 48 h a ete enregistree. Les acariens sensibles provenant des differents pays europeens ont presente la meme sensibilite au τ-fluvalinate et les souches resistantes des diverses regions, le meme niveau de sensibilite reduite (figure I). Une correlation significative a ete montree entre l'efficacite au champ de l'Apistan® et l'efficacite du test la baloratoire. La sensibilite du test de laboratoire a ete plus forte que celle des essais au champ (figure 2). La figure 3 donne les regions ou la resistance aux pyrethrinoides a ete decelee. Il semble qu'une souche resistante se soit creee en Italie puis etendue a la Slovenie, la Suisse, la France, la Belgique et l'Autriche.
2055207960	Introduction  The Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) genome contains four ORFs, S (surface), P (polymerase), C (core) and X. S is completely overlapped by P and as a consequence the overlapping region is subject to distinctive evolutionary constraints compared to the remainder of the genome. Specifically, a non-synonymous substitution in one coding frame may produce a synonymous substitution in the alternative frame, suggesting a possible conflict between requirements for diversifying and purifying forces. To examine how these contrasting requirements are balanced within this region, we investigated the relationship amongst positive selection sites, conserved regions, epitopes and elements of protein structure to consider how HBV balances the contrasting evolutionary pressures.   Methodology/Results  323 HBV genotype D genome sequences were collected and analyzed to identify sites under positive selection and highly conserved regions. Epitopes sequences were retrieved from previously published experimental studies stored in the Immune Epitope Database. Predicted secondary structures were used to investigate the association between structure and conservation. Entropy was used as a measure of conservation and bivariate logistic regression was used to investigate the relationship between positive selection/conserved sites and epitope/secondary structure regions. Our results indicate: (i) conservation in S is primarily dictated by α-helix elements in the protein structure, (ii) variable residues are mainly located in PreS, the major hydrophilic region (MHR) and the C-terminus, (iii) epitopes in S, which are directly targeted by the host immune system, are significantly associated with sites under positive selection.   Conclusions  The highly variable spacer domain in P, which corresponds to PreS in S, appears to act as a harbor for the accumulation of mutations that can provide flexibility for conformational changes and responding to immune pressure.
2055208012	Five mutants defective in tolerance toward a high concentration of NaCl (10%), KCl (10%), and glucose (60 %) in Zygosaccharomyces rouxii were isolated. These mutants were divided into two recessive and two dominant classes designated sat1, sat2, SAT3, and SAT4. The sat1 and SAT3 mutants are defective in NaCl tolerance, but have KCl and glucose tolerance. The sat2 and SAT4 mutants are sensitive for these three substances in a certain concentration. These facts suggest that there are two different mechanisms for the salt and glucose tolerances.
2055208054	The HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp120 interacts consecutively with CD4 and the CCR5 coreceptor to mediate the entry of certain HIV-1 strains into target cells. Acidic residues and sulfotyrosines in the amino-terminal domain (Nt) of CCR5 are crucial for viral fusion and entry. We tested the binding of a panel of CCR5 Nt peptides to different soluble gp120/CD4 complexes and anti-CCR5 mAbs. The tyrosine residues in the peptides were sulfated, phosphorylated, or unmodified. None of the gp120/CD4 complexes associated with peptides containing unmodified or phosphorylated tyrosines. The gp120/CD4 complexes containing envelope glycoproteins from isolates that use CCR5 as a coreceptor associated with Nt peptides containing sulfotyrosines but not with peptides containing sulfotyrosines in scrambled Nt sequences. Finally, only peptides containing sulfotyrosines inhibited the entry of an R5 isolate. Our data show that proper posttranslational modification of the CCR5 Nt is required for gp120 binding and viral entry. More importantly, the Nt domain determines the specificity of the interaction between CCR5 and gp120s from isolates that use this coreceptor.
2055208085	Object The receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE) may play an important role in inflammatory processes and endothelial activation, likely to accelerate the processes of atherosclerosis, especially in patients with diabetes. The factors that regulate the expression of RAGE are not completely clear. C-reactive protein (CRP) is identified as a key proinflammatory cytokine in patients with atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis also induces reduction and dysfunction of endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs), a main cell type for vascular repair. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that CRP can regulate RAGE expression and alter antioxidant defenses in EPCs. Methods and results EPCs, isolated from bone marrow, were cultured in the absence or presence of lipopolysaccharide-free CRP (5, 10, 15, 20, and 50 microg/mL). RAGE protein expression was measured by flow cytometric analysis and Western blot. RAGE messenger RNA expression was detected by polymerase chain reaction. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) were analyzed using the ROS assay kit. A spectrophotometer was used to assess superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase activity, and polymerase chain reaction was used to test messenger RNA expression of superoxide dismutase and glutathione peroxidase. Apoptosis was evaluated by Annexin V immunostaining. Coculturing with CRP caused a significant upregulate expression of RAGE in EPCs, increased ROS production, altered antioxidant defenses, and induced EPC apoptosis. In addition, these effects were attenuated during blocking RAGE protein expression by small interfering RNA. Conclusions CRP at concentrations known to predict cardiovascular event may serve to impair EPC antioxidant defenses for upregulating the expression of RAGE and promote EPC sensitivity toward oxidative stress-mediated apoptosis. These data further support a direct role of CRP in the development and/or progression of atherosclerosis.

2055208137	This article reports the first preparation of miniantibodies to Azospirillum brasilense Sp245 surface antigens by using a combinatorial phage library of sheep antibodies. The prepared phage antibodies were used for the first time for lipopolysaccharide and flagellin detection by dot assay, electro-optical analysis of cell suspensions, and transmission electron microscopy. Interaction of A. brasilense Sp245 with antilipopolysaccharide and antiflagellin phage-displayed miniantibodies caused the magnitude of the electro-optical signal to change considerably. The electro-optical results were in good agreement with the electron microscopic data. This is the first reported possibility of employing phage-displayed miniantibodies in bacterial detection aided by electro-optical analysis of cell suspensions.
2055208187	Abstract Abdim’s Storks Ciconia abdimii were studied in a post-breeding staging area dominated by Sahelian grasslands in southeastern Niger. In late September 2003, a total of 5,763 birds was recorded on systematic transect counts. The estimated density was 5.66 per km2, equivalent to a total of c. 17,000 Abdim’s Stork within the utilized area of 3,000 km2. A high percentage of juveniles in the flocks in late August, when the Nigerien breeding population is still at their nests, indicate a southern origin of the birds. The storks probably make northward post-breeding movements into the Sahel to feed on locally abundant food supplies, first of all Senegalese Grasshopper Oedaleus senegalensis, the dominant grasshopper species in the area. The mean density of Oedaleus in late September 2003 was 11.2 per m2 (6.7 g fresh weight/m2). Storks feeding on grasshoppers made on average 5.6 successful pecks per min during their first h of daily feeding, enabling them to fulfil 95% of their daily energy requirements wi...
2055208201	Test errors are much greater than usually thought and their investigation requires good statistical design. Analysis of variance of blind randomized trials is especially valuable. For representative selections of tests currently used in bacterial taxonomy and identification, the discrepancies within one laboratory are usually less than 4%; with care they can be reduced to 2% or less. Between-laboratory variation is much greater; discrepancies of about 8% are usual under routine conditions, and even 15% is common. The effect of errors on identification is due to (a) error in the reference descriptions of taxa, (b) error in the description of the unknown strain to be identified. Simultaneous polythetic methods (e.g., using matching coefficients or analogues of these) are robust to both types of error, and misidentifications are usually minor in degree, i.e., the unknown is allocated to a taxon close to the correct one. The rate of failure is expected to be greatest when the reference descriptions are based on the tightest clusters. Sequential identification methods are especially sensitive to errors because the unknown may then be allocated to a taxon far from the correct one. Monothetic sequential keys are sensitive to errors of type (b), whereas type (a) error is usually screened out during construction of the key.
2055208217	Inner centromere protein (INCENP) and centromere protein E (CENPE) are two functionally important proteins of the higher eukaryotic centromere. Using a mouse Incenp genomic DNA and a mouse Cenpe cDNA to analyze recombinant inbred mouse sets, as well as interspecific backcross panels, we have mapped these genes to the proximal regions of mouse Chromosomes 19 and 6, respectively. Comparison of Cenpe and human CENPE, which maps to chromosome region 4q24→q25, has further identified a new region of homology between the two species.
2055208283	Leptin can enhance thymopoiesis and modulate the T-cell immune response. However, it remains controversial whether these effects correlate with the expression of leptin receptor, ObR. We herein addressed this issue by using in vivo animal models and in vitro culture systems. Leptin treatment in both ob/ob mice and normal young mice induced increases of CD4 SP thymocytes in thymus and CD4 T cells in the periphery. Interestingly, expression of the long form ObR was significantly restricted to DN, DP and CD4 SP, but not CD8 SP thymocytes. Moreover, in the reaggregated DP thymocyte cultures with leptin plus TSCs, leptin profoundly induced differentiation of CD4 SP but not CD8 SP thymocytes, suggesting that the effects of leptin on thymocyte differentiation might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor in developing thymocytes. Surprisingly, ObR expression was markedly higher in peripheral CD4 T cells than that in CD8 T cells. Furthermore, leptin treatment with or without IL-2 and PHA had preferential effects on cell proliferation of CD4 T cells compared to that of CD8 T cells. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the effects of leptin on differentiation and proliferation of CD4 T cells might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor.
2055208284	The ridgetail white prawn Exopalaemon carinicauda is one of the most important commercial species in eastern China. However, little information of immune genes in E. carinicauda has been reported. To identify distinctive genes associated with immunity, an expressed sequence tag (EST) library was constructed from hemocytes of E. carinicauda. A total of 3411 clones were sequenced, yielding 2853 ESTs and the average sequence length is 436 bp. The cluster and assembly analysis yielded 1053 unique sequences including 329 contigs and 724 singletons. Blast analysis identified 593 (56.3%) of the unique sequences as orthologs of genes from other organisms (E-value < 1e-5). Based on the COG and Gene Ontology (GO), 593 unique sequences were classified. Through comparison with previous studies, 153 genes assembled from 367 ESTs have been identified as possibly involved in defense or immune functions. These genes are categorized into seven categories according to their putative functions in shrimp immune system: antimicrobial peptides, prophenoloxidase activating system, antioxidant defense systems, chaperone proteins, clottable proteins, pattern recognition receptors and other immune-related genes. According to EST abundance, the major immune-related genes were thioredoxin (141, 4.94% of all ESTs) and calmodulin (14, 0.49% of all ESTs). The EST sequences of E. carinicauda hemocytes provide important information of the immune system and lay the groundwork for development of molecular markers related to disease resistance in prawn species.
2055208293	Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2014; April 5-9, 2014; San Diego, CAMetastasis of cancer cells to distant sites leads to poor prognosis and comprises approximately 90% of cancer mortalities. It is evident that metastasis requires resistance to anoikis, an apoptotic program induced by detachment from the extracellular matrix. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are molecular chaperones whose major functions include protein folding and suppression of apoptosis, and are transcriptionally regulated by heat shock transcription factor-1 (HSF1). HSF1 has been linked to metastasis and promotes anchorage-independent proliferation of breast cancer cells. HSP60 is a chaperone found in both the mitochondria and cytosol and is linked to metastasis and regulation of tumor cell apoptosis. To investigate whether HSF1 and HSP60 are necessary for anoikis resistance, anchorage-dependent lung carcinoma (A549, H460) and normal lung epithelial (Beas-2b) cells were suspended by plating on poly-2-hydroxyethyl-methacrylate-coated culture dishes. Anoikis induction was measured by executioner caspase-7 cleavage and PARP cleavage by western blot. Protein expression was measured by western blot. Small-interfering RNAs were used to inhibit hsf1 and hsp60. We show here that upon detachment for 24-48h, lung cancer cells resisted caspase-dependent anoikis in contrast to normal lung epithelial cells, with A549 cells showing the highest level of anoikis resistance. After 24h detachment there was increased phosphorylation of HSF1 on activating serine 326 in lung cancer cells. Antisense inhibition of hsf1 and hsp60 in attached lung cancer cells had minimal effects on caspase-7 and PARP cleavage. In contrast, hsf1 and hsp60 knockdown in cancer cells that were suspended for 24-48h initiated caspase-dependent anoikis. Furthermore, knockdown of hsf1 resulted in inhibition of HSP72, HSP40, and HSP27. HSP60 was not significantly inhibited with loss of HSF1. This data suggests that HSF1 and HSP60 are necessary for lung carcinoma anoikis resistance. Our work adds to evidence suggesting HSF1 and HSP60 are promising therapeutic targets for metastasis prevention. Although more detailed mechanistic evaluation is necessary, a therapeutic approach to induce anoikis in circulating tumor cells by modulating HSF1 or HSP60 may be promising.Citation Format: Jack D. Carter, Suzanne K. Murphy. Heat shock transcription factor-1 and heat shock protein 60 are important for lung carcinoma anoikis resistance. [abstract].

2055208330	The new Australian genus Australocilliba is closely related to the European Cilliba von Heyden, the main distinguishing morphological features of the former being the presence of a claw on tarsus I, the extended anterior margin of the female epigynium and the elongate cheliceral digits. Two new species, A. kuchtaorum and A. hallidayi, are described.
2055208335	Immuno-enzyme histochemical investigations showed that, in the magnocellular hypothalamo-hypophysial neurosecretory system of the rat, vasopressin and oxytocin are synthetized in separate neurons. Both the vasopressin neurons and the oxytocin neurons are present in both the supraoptic and the paraventricular nuclei in about the same number. Preferential location of the two kinds of rat neurosecretory neurons is not as obvious as in the bovine hypothalamus. Their perikarya do not show distinct morphological differences. The two kinds of neurosecretory perikarya are the origin of separate vasopressin-containing and oxytocin-containing axons respectively. In the neural lobe, the distribution of the two different types of axons is described.
2055208346	. An extract vaccine against Vibrio anguillarum was compared with other vaccine preparations when administered to rainbow trout intraperitoneally or orally on food. Intraperitoneal vaccination resulted in virtually 100% protection within two weeks whereas oral vaccination gave a maximum protection of 50–70% after eight weeks. When administered intraperitoneally the extract performed better than formalin killed cells but when administered orally formalin killed cells were better. The addition of alum as adjuvant enhanced the response to antigen administered by both routes. Serum agglutinin litres after oral vaccination were low and variable but after intraperitoneal injection they reached a consistent peak of 64. As the response to oral vaccination was so low it was not possible to relate agglutinin titre to protection in a quantitative relationship.

2055208526	Prey distribution, patch size, and the presence of conspecifics are important factors influencing a predator’s feeding tactics, including the decision to feed individually or socially. Little is known about group behaviour in seabirds as they spend most of their lives in the marine environment where it is difficult to observe their foraging activities. In this study, we report on at-sea foraging associations of little penguins (Eudyptula minor) during the breeding season. Individuals could be categorised as (1) not associating; (2) associating when departing from and/or returning to the colony; or (3) at sea when travelling, diving or performing synchronised dives. Out of 84 separate foraging tracks, 58 (69.0%) involved associations with conspecifics. Furthermore, in a total of 39 (46.4%), individuals were found to dive during association and in 32 (38.1%), individuals were found to exhibit synchronous diving. These behaviours suggest little penguins forage in groups, could synchronise their underwater movements and potentially cooperate to concentrate their small schooling prey.
2055208550	A B S T R A C T The flowers of Amyema miquelEi and A. miraculosum are protandrous and pollinated by birds. Their dry-type stigmatic surface is composed of unicellular papillae. At the male phase, these papillae are constricted with rugulose surfaces. During the transition to the female (pollen receptive) phase these cells expand, almost doubling in width while their surface becomes much smoother. Beneath the thin proteinaceous pellicle, the papillar wall consists of an extraordinarily thick bi-layered cuticle overlying the primary wall. The two layers of the cuticle are stained by lipid dyes, but are distinguished by their different responses to other cytochemical tests. The reaction product for the enzyme esterase is present within crenulations on the papillar surface in small amounts, and in dense deposits in the cuticular clefts at the base between papillae. Not surprisingly, pollen tubes are unable to penetrate the thick papillar cap and enter the style through these clefts. The unusual thickness of the cuticle is interpreted as an adaptive response
2055208622	Heat tolerant fungi are organisms that may perform bioconversion processes and produce industrially important metabolites. They may either be obligate thermophiles or simple thermotolerants. The present document is the continuation of a critical note on thermotolerant fungi erroneously reported in the literature as possessing thermophilic attributes. Fifty strictly thermotolerant taxa are here considered. Some of their binomials have only recently been introduced in the scientific literature. The reported thermotolerant species are grouped according to broad taxonomic categories. The nomenclature of zygomycetous taxa and anamorphic fungi is straightforward, as usually only one binomial is available or only one state is produced in culture respectively. For Ascomycetes regularly producing in culture a conidial state, the name of the sexual state (teleomorph) should be used to designate the organism even when a binomial is available for the anamorph; this prevents the practice of interchangeably using the name of either states of the same fungus. When ascomycetous taxa produce the anamorph regularly and the teleomorph only under specific cultural conditions, the name of the anamorph could be preferentially selected. The goal is to introduce uniformity in name citations of fungi, particularly in the literature of applied research. Each species is reported under its taxonomically correct name, either the original binomial or the latest combined binomial after generic transfer(s). Known synonyms are also specified. Maximum efforts were undertaken to trace updated information on the taxonomic position of these fifty strict thermotolerant species. For each, information on the type material, morphological features distinguishing it from related members of the genus (and when necessary a generic taxonomic assessment) and, finally, salient ecological features including heat tolerance levels are given. For some information on their biotechnological use is also provided. Overall 86 strictly thermotolerant fungi are so far documented in the corresponding published and present contributions; however, this figure should not be regarded as exhaustive for the group. Among these 86 taxa ascomycetous fungi (46) presently outnumber anamorphic microfungi (28) but their relevant figures should be regarded as provisional. Only 12 zygomycetous species proved to be strict thermotolerants. Further cardinal temperature growth values established for these 86 thermotolerants disclose no pattern linked to their broad taxonomic categories. Standardized growth temperature curves at increments smaller than 5 °C have to be performed to assess conclusively variability in growth temperature relationships. Several heat tolerant fungi are widely used in industry; however, more research is needed to explore the applied potential of these particular organisms. An exhaustive document on the biodiversity of heat tolerant fungi also awaits production. It would be informative in relation to the global warming process of the earth.
2055208628	Summary Glial cells are crucial regulators of synapse formation, elimination, and plasticity [1, 2]. In vitro studies have begun to identify glial-derived synaptogenic factors [1], but neuron-glia signaling events during synapse formation in vivo remain poorly defined. The coordinated development of pre- and postsynaptic compartments at the Drosophila neuromuscular junction (NMJ) depends on a muscle-secreted retrograde signal, the TGF-β/BMP Glass bottom boat (Gbb) [3, 4]. Muscle-derived Gbb activates the TGF-β receptors Wishful thinking (Wit) and either Saxophone (Sax) or Thick veins (Tkv) in motor neurons [3, 4]. This induces phosphorylation of Mad (P-Mad) in motor neurons, its translocation into the nucleus with a co-Smad, and activation of transcriptional programs controlling presynaptic bouton growth [5]. Here we show that NMJ glia release the TGF-β ligand Maverick (Mav), which likely activates the muscle activin-type receptor Punt to potently modulate Gbb-dependent retrograde signaling and synaptic growth. Loss of glial Mav results in strikingly reduced P-Mad at NMJs, decreased Gbb transcription in muscle, and in turn reduced muscle-to-motor neuron retrograde TGF-β/BMP signaling. We propose that by controlling Gbb release from muscle, glial cells fine tune the ability of motor neurons to extend new synaptic boutons in correlation to muscle growth. Our work identifies a novel glia-derived synaptogenic factor by which glia modulate synapse formation in vivo.
2055208639	During the past decade we and others have shown that bone is a storehouse for growth factors. Accordingly, bone contains a number of growth factors including insulin-like growth factors I and II (IGF-I, IGF-II) transforming growth factor (TGF-beta 1, TGF-beta 2), platelet-derived growth factor, basic and acidic fibroblast growth factor, and bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Osteoblasts have been shown to produce many of these growth factors, which then act in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. The production of these growth factors is regulated by both systemic hormones and local mechanical stress. Recent studies on the relative distribution of bone growth factors during different physiologic and pathologic situations indicate that the concentration of bone growth factors is not invariant and provide indirect evidence that growth factors deposited in bone have physiologic significance. In addition, many of these bone growth factors have been shown to increase bone formation either systemically or locally in vivo. Based on the past findings, we propose that different growth factors may have a specific role in regulating proliferation and differentiation of different stages of osteoblast lineage cells and play important roles in the local regulation of bone formation.
2055208700	Pichinde virus preparations were investigated for ribosomal components and associated activities. After detergent treatment and fractionation, viral components were assayed for polypeptide synthesis, elongation of nascent polypeptide chains, and mRNA activity. It was demonstrated that these subviral particles could synthesize polypeptides when exogenous mRNA template, aminoacyl--tRNAs, translation factors, GTP and appropriate cations were added. Undisrupted, whole virions could not synthesize polypeptide; disruption and subsequent centrifugation of subviral ribosomes was a prerequisite for the biosynthetic activity described.
2055208732	Abstract Small bioactive peptides, with diverse biological functions, have received increasing attention as physiologically beneficial substances in animal production. The main obstacle to wide application of small bioactive peptides is a lack of cost-effective methods for mass production. In this study, we used glycyl-glutamine (Gly-Gln) as a test case to develop a novel mass-production method for small bioactive peptides. The oligonucleotide encoding Gly-Gln pro-peptide (Gpp) was designed and synthesized. Gpp includes 3 Gly-Gln dipeptides and 2 enzymatic sites for pepsin and trypase, allowing direct digestion and absorption of Gly-Gln in the gastrointestinal tract. The Gpp oligonucleotides were linked to generate an oligomeric oligonucleotide segment containing 12 tandem copies of Gpp. This 12Gpp segment was cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli vector pET32a. By optimizing culture conditions [0.1 mmol L −1 isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 50 μg mL −1 ampicillin (Amp), 30°C for 12 h], the thioredoxin fusion peptides reached 40% of total bacterial protein. After purification, the fusion protein was fed to Kunming mice to determine its effect on mouse immune function. The results showed that similar to Gly-Gln dipeptide, Gpp polymer protein could significantly suppress the proliferation of T and B lymphocytes in blood and spleen, and additionally could significantly improve interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) secretion of blood and spleen lymphocytes. These effects were not observed in mice fed a 2 amino acids mix (glycine and glutamine). These evidences indicated that an efficient digestion of Gpp polymer protein could be achieved when ingested into the animal gut. The expression system in this study provides a potential production method for not only Gly-Gln dipeptide but also other short bioactive peptides.
2055208733	The gene expression regulation of the Na+-dependent high affinity glutamate/aspartate transporter GLAST expressed in cultured Bergmann glia cells from chick cerebellum was studied. A 679 bp fragment of the chick GLAST cDNA was cloned and sequenced. Specific PCR primers were used to quantify chick GLAST mRNA levels. Treatment of the cells with the Ca2+/diacylglycerol dependent protein kinase C (PKC) activator, phorbol 12-tetradecanoyl-13-acetate (TPA) produced a decrease in transporter mRNA levels, without an effect in its mRNA half life, suggesting a transcriptional down regulation. Activation of the cAMP pathway results in a transient decrease in GLAST mRNA levels, in contrast with the TPA effect. These findings suggest that GLAST expression is under control of distinct signaling pathways.
2055208759	FtsZ, a homolog of eukaryotic tubulin, is involved in the process of cell division, particularly in septum formation in bacteria. The primary amino acid sequences of this protein are fairly conserved in prokaryotes. We observed that a eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr protein kinase, PknA from Mycobacterium tuberculosis, when expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited cell elongation due to a defect in septum formation. We found that FtsZ either from Escherichia coli (eFtsZ) or from M. tuberculosis (mFtsZ) was phosphorylated on co-expression with PknA. Consistent with these observations, solid phase binding and in vitro kinase assays revealed the ability of PknA to interact with mFtsZ protein and also to phosphorylate it. We, therefore, ascertained mFtsZ as a substrate of PknA. Furthermore, the phosphorylated mFtsZ exhibited impairment in its GTP hydrolysis and polymerization abilities. Thus, our results highlighted the ability of PknA to phosphorylate as well as to regulate the functionality of FtsZ, the protein central to cell division throughout the bacterial lineage.
2055208794	SUMMARY Physical and chemical composition of some walnut (Juglans regia L) genotypes grown in Turkey. Walnut (Juglans regia L.) samples were collected during the 2000 and 2001 harvests from different selections of trees grown in Turkey. Important physical and biochemical properties of fruit were examined in these walnut types. At the end of this study, 10 types were selected and nut and kernel properties, fatty acid composition and the proximate composition of these selections which are commonly grown in Turkey were evaluated. Physical properties are attributed to the quality criteria of nuts. Investigated genotypes showed good quality according to the test results. The total oil content ranged from 61.97 to 70.92% while the crude protein ranged from 15.17 to 19.24%. Ash ranged from 1.26 to 2.06% while the moisture was found between 3.25-3.91% of the kernel. The total carbohydrate was calculated as between 8.05-13.23%. The oleic acid content of the oils ranged from 21.18 to 40.20% of the total fatty acids, while the linoleic acid content ranged from 43.94 to 60.12% and the linolenic contents from 6.91 to11.52%. It was found that palmitic acid was between 5.24 and 7.62%, while stearic acid ranged from 2.56 to 3.67%.
2055208812	Why and how we age remains a topic that has kept molecular biologists busy for the past few decades. In recent years, several studies pointed to sirtuins as important players in lifespan regulation, yet, in vivo proof for most of the mammalian homologs was missing. In this issue of The EMBO Journal, Sinclair and colleagues provide novel evidence that SIRT2 is indeed a critical modulator of aging in vivo.
2055208822	Abstract We have characterized cis-acting elements involved in light regulation of the nuclear gene (GapA) encoding the A subunit of chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our results show that a 1.1-kb promoter fragment of the GapA gene is sufficient to confer light inducibility and organ specificity in transgenic Nicotiana tabacum (tobacco) plants, using the beta-glucuronidase gene of Escherichia coli as the reporter gene. Deletion analysis indicates that the -359 to -110 bp region of the GapA gene is necessary for light responsiveness. Within this region there are three copies of a decamer repeat (termed the Gap box) having the consensus sequence 5'-CAAATGAA(A/G)A-3', which has not been characterized in the promoter regions of other light-regulated genes. A deletion (to -247) producing loss of one copy of these elements from the GapA promoter reduces light induction by two- to threefold compared with a promoter deletion (to -359) with all three Gap boxes present, while deletion of all three Gap boxes (to -110) abolishes light induction completely. Gel mobility shift experiments using tobacco nuclei as the source of nuclear proteins show that GapA promoter fragments that contain these repeats bind strongly to a factor in the nuclear extract and that binding can be abolished by synthetic competitors consisting only of a monomer or dimer of the Gap box. Furthermore, a trimer, dimer, and monomer of the Gap box show binding activity and, like the authentic GapA promoter-derived probes, show binding activities that are correlated with Gap box copy number. These results strongly suggest that these repeats play important roles in light regulation of the GapA gene of A. thaliana.

2055208835	Abstract It has been hypothesized ( Reichardt and Kaiser, 1971 ) that transcription of the λ genes c I and rex , which code for repressor and rex protein, respectively, can be initiated at either of two sites depending on whether or not repressor itself is present. On infection of a sensitive cell, transcription of repressor ( c I) and rex mRNA is thought to be initiated at a “promoter for establishment of repressor synthesis” ( pre ); however, in an established lysogen, in the presence of active repressor, synthesis of c I- rex mRNA appears to be initiated at a “promoter for maintenance of repressor synthesis” ( prm ), whose existence has been inferred from several indirect observations ( Bode and Kaiser, 1965 ; Reichardt and Kaiser, 1971 ; Echols and Green, 1971 ; Castelazzi et al. , 1972 ). In this communication, we describe the isolation of a mutant defective in prm , the promoter for synthesis of c I- rex mRNA in the presence of repressor (as in an established lysogen). The mutant, prm 116, maps at a single site between the c I gene and 0 R (the operator to which repressor binds to block rightward transcription of the λ x operon), is phenotypically c I − rex − , and yet complements the pre − mutant c Y42 for lysogenization. Thus, its existence precisely locates prm and provides a direct verification of some elements of the two-promoter hypothesis for c I- rex transcription. Since prm 116 does not appear to affect repressor binding at 0 R , the two sites, prm and 0 R , can be separated functionally by mutation.
2055208858	Abstract The prehistory of the southern coast of Brazil (Santa Catarina state) is materialized in the present landscape by numerous large-scale shellmounds, shellmounds with a sandy core, and fishmounds. A geoarchaeological approach was applied to understand the sequence and diversity of human actions involved in the settlement of the area as expressed in the multiple mounded structures, dated from the early Holocene to shortly before the arrival of the first colonizers. A detailed account of the composition and history of four stratified shellmounds, two shellmounds with a sandy core, and two fishmounds is given using a standard method for intra and inter site comparisons. The method combines the macroscopic evaluation of the profiles with off-site sampling, provenance of the organic matter in the sediments, and micro-scale identification of components, their alteration, and arrangement. Substantial implications result from this analysis related to the identification of recurrent behaviors in shellmound formation and growth, prehistoric alteration and destruction of habitation sites, development of a built environment, and continuity in mound building as an expression of group identity. Shellmounds and fishmounds show a complex pre-depositional history that denies the traditional view of them as secondary deposits of food remains.
2055208928	Ischemia-reperfusion (IR) injury is significantly worse in aged hearts, but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Age-related damage to mitochondria may be a critical feature, which manifests in an exacerbation of IR injury. Silent information regulator of transcription 3 (SIRT3), the major mitochondrial NAD+-dependent lysine deacetylase, regulates a variety of functions, and its inhibition may disrupt mitochondrial function to impact recovery from IR injury. In this study, the role of SIRT3 in mediating the response to cardiac IR injury was examined using an in vitro model of SIRT3 knockdown (SIRT3kd) in H9c2 cardiac-derived cells and in Langendorff preparations from adult (7 mo old) wild-type (WT) and SIRT3+/− hearts and aged (18 mo old) WT hearts. SIRT3kd cells were more vulnerable to simulated IR injury and exhibited a 46% decrease in mitochondrial complex I (Cx I) activity with low O2 consumption rates compared with controls. In the Langendorff model, SIRT3+/− adult hearts showed less functional recovery and greater infarct vs. WT, which recapitulates the in vitro results. In WT aged hearts, recovery from IR injury was similar to SIRT3+/− adult hearts. Mitochondrial protein acetylation was increased in both SIRT3+/− adult and WT aged hearts (relative to WT adult), suggesting similar activities of SIRT3. Also, enzymatic activities of two SIRT3 targets, Cx I and MnSOD, were similarly and significantly inhibited in SIRT3+/− adult and WT aged cardiac mitochondria. In conclusion, decreased SIRT3 may increase the susceptibility of cardiac-derived cells and adult hearts to IR injury and may contribute to a greater level of IR injury in the aged heart.
2055209007	GD3-synthase is one of the key sialyltransferases responsible for synthesis of ganglioside GD3, the substrate for initiation of the ‘b’ and ‘c’ series ganglioside synthesis. We have previously cloned the rat GD3-synthase gene promoter, and preliminary characterization has identified a minimal 0.5-kb region that has a strong basal promoter activity, and is GC-rich and has no CAAT or TATA boxes. In this study, we showed that the Sp1 and NF-κB sites in this region significantly contributed to basal GD3-synthase promoter activity. When either the Sp1 or NF-κB sites were deleted, a 50% decrease in promoter activity was observed. The same results were obtained by a decoy strategy using oligonucleotides containing the Sp1 or NF-κB sites. The binding to the Sp1 and NF-κB sites was confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), competition and supershift EMSA. In addition, cell-type specific activation of the promoter was also determined. The promoter was highly activated in the GD3-expressing F-11 cells while repressed in NG-108 cells in which GD3 is almost undetectable. An additional band of NF-κB family was identified only in the F-11 nuclear extract using the NF-κB consensus probe by EMSA. DNA pull-down assays were further carried out to screen proteins that bound to the promoter including the basal region and the potential negative-regulatory region between −526 and −769. More than 10 major binding proteins were pulled down, some of which were present only in the F-11 or NG-108 nuclear extracts. Our data demonstrate that NF-κB and Sp1 are the major determinants for the basal promoter activity and some factors such as NF-κB may be involved in cell type-specific expression of the gene.
2055209036	We investigated possible interactions between HIV-1 receptor (CD4) and the main coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5. We found that CD4 and CXCR4 coexpressed in 293T cells form a complex that can be immunoprecipitated with antibodies directed against the extracellular domain of either protein. Mutagenesis revealed that the CD4/CXCR4 interaction maps to two previously uncharacterized basic motifs in the cytoplasmic domain of CD4. HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein-mediated membrane fusion was found to be independent of the ability of CD4 and CXCR4 to interact, whether fusion was studied in a virus-cell or a cell-cell model. However, this interaction might explain the adaptation of HIV-1 to CXCR4 as an alternative to CCR5. We found that CXCR4 also interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of CD8alpha in a way that is similar to the CD4/CXCR4 interaction. The CD4/CXCR4 and CD8alpha/CXCR4 interactions may thus be involved in cellular signaling pathways shared by the CD4 and CD8alpha molecules.
2055209065	Abstract A RecA protein-generated triple-stranded DNA species can be observed by electron microscopy, within narrowly defined conditions. Three-stranded DNA is detected only when initiation of normal DNA strand exchange is precluded by heterologous sequences within the duplex DNA substrate, when ATP is hydrolyzed, and when the DNA is cross-linked with a psoralen derivative prior to removal of RecA filaments. When adenosine 5′-O-(thiotriphosphate) is used, only the product hybrid duplex DNA can be cross-linked within the RecA filament. The third strand is either displaced or interwound in a conformation that does not permit cross-linking. When ATP is hydrolyzed by RecA, all three strands are cross-linked within the filament in a complex pattern that suggests a dynamic structure. This structure is altered when RecA protein is removed before cross-linking. Hsieh et al.(1990) and Rao et al.(1991, 1993) have proposed, on the basis of nuclease protection and chemical modification studies, that a stable triple-stranded DNA species can persist after removal of RecA protein. We have been unable to visualize these triple-stranded structures by the methods used in the present investigation. When RecA removal was followed immediately by interstrand cross-linking, only the two strands of the hybrid duplex DNA were cross-linked.
2055209075	SUMMARY  Spread of Septoria nodorum from inoculated point sources was examined in pure stands and mixtures of two spring wheat cultivars Kolibri and Maris Butler. Gradients in disease were observed soon after inoculation; the presence of the more resistant cultivar (Maris Butler) in the mixtures retarded the outward spread of disease compared with the susceptible pure stand (Kolibri). Regression analysis suggested that gradients in incidence were influenced by nearness to the source whereas gradients in severity were not.    Spread of disease was also examined in pure stands and mixtures for the host/pathogen combinations, winter wheat (cvs Maris Huntsman and Maris Ranger)/S. nodorum and winter barley (cvs Maris Otter and Hoppel)/Rhynchosporium secalis. In contrast to the spring wheat experiment, no gradients were observed; explanations for the uniform distribution of disease were (a) extensive spread prior to the period of assessment, (b) no physical barrier to dispersal due to the juvenile growth stage of the crop and (c) exhaustion of the point-source.
2055209076	The centipedes brought from Torijima I. consist of two species of Lithobi-idae and one species of Henicopidae, all of which are the Holarctic elements. Lamyctes guamus is the first example of the genus Lamyctes found in Japan. The diagnoses of the female are as follows; Ocellus presents, large one. Anten-nae short and 27 articles in a female but about 20 in other specimens. First two articles very large in comparison with the others. Prosternal teeth 2+2. Prefensor stout. Mandible with five teeth. Tarsus of 1-12 legs simple, unarmed. Coxal pores round, small, 2, 2, 2, 2 in female instead of 1, 1, 1, 1 in male. Claw of gonopods in female obtuse and chitinous, basal spines 2+2, stout. Anal legs long as well as other species. Locality: Torijima I., Aug. 13, 14, 15, 1950, collected by Mr. I. Fujiyama. The fact that Dr. Chamberlin reported this species from Guam in 1946 is very interesting from the zoogeographical point of view, as the Lithobiid centi-pedes wwrw not expected to bew found in such an area as Micronesia, Bonin Is., etc.
2055209085	The acidity of the gastric contents of fasted members of seven families of primates was measured, and no relationship was found between acid concentration and phylogenetic development; in general, however, gastric acidity was higher in New World monkeys than in Old World monkeys. The administration of histamine increased gastric acidity.
2055209115	Abstract The gene coding for Bacillus subtilis RNA polymerase major sigma 43, rpoD, was cloned together with its neighboring genes in a 7 kb EcoRI fragment. The complete nucleotide sequence of a 5 kb fragment including the entire rpoD gene revealed the presence of two other genes preceding rpoD in the order P23-dnaE-rpoD. The dnaE codes for DNA primase while the function of P23 remains unknown. The three genes reside in an operon that is similar in organization to the E. coli RNA polymerase major sigma 70 operon, which is composed of genes encoding small ribosome protein S21 (rpsU), DNA primase (dnaG), and RNA polymerase sigma 70 (rpoD). There is a relatively high degree of base and amino acid homology between the DNA primase and sigma genes. The most significant differences between the two operons are observed in the molecular size of the first genes (P23 and rpsU), the complete lack of amino acid homology between P23 and S21, the molecular weights of the two rpoD genes, the size of the intercistronic region between the first two genes, and the regulatory elements of the operon.
2055209143	A five year field trial evaluated 71 oilseed sunflower, Helianthus annuus L., accessions, 32 breeding lines, and 25 interspecific crosses for resistance to infestation by naturally occurring populations of the banded sunflower moth, Cochylis hospes Walsingham (Lepidoptera: Tortricidae), in North Dakota. Germplasm with resistance to attack by the banded sunflower moth and subsequent larval feeding damage in the seeds was identified. PI 251902 had less than 10% feeding damage per head in all five years of testing and less than 6% in three of the five years. PI 372259 and PI 170401 exhibited 12% or less seed damage in three years of evaluation and PI 253776 had only 3% damage in two of the three years and was the least damaged in 2004. Four other accessions (PI 170385, PI 291403, PI 494859, and PI 505651) revealed resistance in three of five years. A number of the interspecific crosses which were retested based on earlier results showed reduced seed damage in 2003, but subsequently exhibited much greater damage the following year due to higher populations of banded sunflower moth. Hybrid 894 was earlier used by others as a susceptible check; however, in the current investigation, this hybrid consistently had the lowest average seed damage from C. hospes feeding among the germplasm evaluated. Results from this investigation indicate that there is potential for developing resistant genotypes with reduced feeding injury that will help sunflower producers reduce yield loss due to the banded sunflower moth. In addition, plant resistance can effectively be combined with delayed planting to decrease densities of C. hospes, thus reducing crop losses without disrupting the control of the larvae by parasitoids.
2055209155	Close agreement between the age at death estimated by macroscopic and microscopic methods was obtained for the Shanidar 3 Neanderthal. This suggests the possibility of obtaining age at death estimates by microscopic methods in other fossil hominids where the skeletal remains are highly fragmentary and macroscopic methods are not applicable.
2055209189	Abstract Hemolymph juvenile hormone-binding protein (JHBP) is synthesized and secreted from fat body in the adult female cockroach, Leucophaea maderae . The data in this paper suggest it is initially secreted from the fat body as a larger peptide whereas data in the accompanying paper demonstrate that JHBP is apolipophorin I. Using media from cultures of fat body maintained in vitro , a JH-binding component was found that is JH III saturable, has a K D of 1.5 × 10 −8 M, binds JH III > JH II > JH I, and has a sedimentation value of 6.5S on high salt sucrose gradients. Each of these properties is identical to those of the JHBP extracted from the hemolymph. To identify the protein that bound JH, media proteins were photoaffinity labeled with 10-[10,11- 3 H]epoxyfarnesyl diazoacetate ([ 3 H]EFDA). The results revealed that two media proteins bound [ 3 H]EFDA in the absence of JH III, but not in the presence of 100-fold excess JH III. The molecular weights of the two media peptides were estimated by SDS-PAGE to be 275,000 and 220,000. To determine if the JHBP found in media of fat body cultures was due to hemolymph contamination of fat body, incorporation of [ 3 H]leucine into newly synthesized and secreted fat body proteins during a 48 h culture period was monitored. During the culture period, linear increases in the concentrations of radiolabeled 275 and 220 kD JHBP were observed. Monoclonal antibodies specific for the 220 kD hemolymph JHBP were found to recognize both the 275 and 220 kD JHBPs in the media. To investigate the possibility that the 275 kD protein is a precursor to the 220 kD protein and that components of the hemolymph process or modify the precursor, hemolymph was introduced into fat body cultures and relative concentrations of the 275 and 220 kD media JHBPs were determined. Addition of hemolymph to these organ cultures resulted in an increase in the concentration of radiolabeled 220 kD JHBP and a proportional decrease in the concentration of radiolabeled 275 kD JHBP, suggesting that the 275 kD protein is a precursor to the 220 kD hemolymph JHBP. The mechanism of processing or modification remains undetermined.

2055209344	Cumin (Cuminum cyminum L.) is one of the most important pharmaceutical plants. As a considerable portion of existing agricultural lands in arid regions is exposed to aridity and finally to salinity, we need to study the effects of salinity on the growth and production of agronomical products. For this purpose, an agricultural experiment in the form of split plots with three replications was conducted in 2011 at the Islamic Azad University, Gonabad Branch, Iran, in the longitude of 58°, 50', latitude of 34°, 54', and altitude of 940 m from the sea level. At the main plot, four salinity levels (2,5,8 and 11ds/m) and at the sub plot, the growth stages of stress implementation (including stress in establishment, flowering, and seed filling stage), were located at random. The results showed that the salinity rate had significant impact on fresh weight, dry weight, height , percentage of essence, seed and biological yield. With the increase in salinity from 2 to 11ds/m, a significant decrease in all vegetative and reproductive characteristics were observed. The most sensitive growth stages of plant to salt stress, during vegetative and reproductive period were the stage of establishment and flowering, respectively. There was no interaction between the growth stage of plant and salinity rate, except for seed yield and harvest index.
2055209456	"The biology of songbirds poses fundamental questions about the interplay between gene, brain, and behavior. New tools of genomic analysis will be invaluable in pursuing answers to these questions. This review begins with a summary of the broad properties of the songbird genome and how songbird brain gene expression has been measured in past studies. Four key problems in songbird biology are then considered from a genomics perspective: What role does differential gene expression play in the development, maintenance, and functional organization of the song control circuit? Does gene regulation set boundaries on the process of juvenile song learning? What is the purpose of song-induced gene activity in the adult brain? How does the genome underlie the profound sexual differentiation of the song control circuit? Finally, the range of genomic technologies currently or soon to be available to songbird researchers is briefly reviewed. These technologies include online databases of expressed genes (""expressed sequence tags"" or ESTs); a complete library of the zebra finch genome maintained as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) library; DNA microarrays for simultaneous measurement of many genes in a single experiment; and techniques for gene manipulation in the organism. Collectively, these questions and techniques define the field of songbird neurogenomics."
2055209500	"The immune reactivity of lymphoid cells from pregnant mice was studied during the course of pregnancy in primiparous and multiparous animals either "" isopregnant "" (male and female of same strain) or "" allopregnant "" (male and female differing at H-2), using a local GVH assay (CBA lymphoid cells injected into (CBA X A/J)F1 recipients). The findings were as follows: The lymphoid cell number in the para-aortic lymph nodes ( PALN ) was increased at all stages of gestation. The peak occurred in the 2nd week in primiparity and as early as 60 h after fertilization in multiparity. PALN cell alloreactivity was weak at the beginning and higher than normal in the third week of pregnancy. Spleen cell alloreactivity was increased in the second week and decreased in the third week in primiparous compared with multiparous animals. Anti-paternal alloreactivity exhibited by spleen cells of allogestation was decreased (as compared to cells of isogestation ) especially in primiparous mice, particularly in the third week. At this time, the anti-paternal alloreactivity of PALN cells was increased. The influence of the recipient's sex on GVHR intensity was reversed when the cells were obtained from a pregnant donor, becoming stronger in male compared with female hybrids."
2055209558	Abstract The wavelength dependence of three different circadian responses to light was compared in Syrian hamsters: phase advances and phase delays induced by 15-min light pulses at CTl8 (circadian time 18) and CTl3, respectively, and changes in free-running period under different levels of constant illumination (LL) intensity. Fluorescent lamps with transmission maxima at 436, 514, and 658 run were used for delivering blue, green, and red light, respectively. White fluorescent light was also used in the LL portion of the study. The magnitude of each circadian response was plotted as a function of light intensity expressed in photons cm −2 s −1 , and intensity-response relationships for the different wavelengths were quantified by fitting the data with a 4-parameter sigmoidal function using a least-squares curve-fitting routine. For each response type, the curves for the different wavelengths were identical but displaced along the horizontal axis (i.e., the functions differed only in the intensity (σ) required for producing a half-maximal response]. The values of a for green and blue light were similar, while that for red light was several times greater. These results indicate that a single class of photoreceptors with peak sensitivity in the blue-green region mediates light-induced phase advances, phase delays, and changes in the period of the hamster circadian pacemaker.
2055209600	Nattokinase was produced by batch and fed-batch culture of Bacillus subtilis in flask and fermentor. Effect of supplementing complex media (peptone, yeast extract, or tryptone) was investigated on the production of nattokinase. In flask culture, the highest cell growth and nattokinase activity were obtained with 50 g/L of peptone supplementation. In this condition, nattokinase activity was 630 unit/ml at 12 h. In batch culture of B. subtilis in fermentor, the highest nattokinase activity of 3400 unit/ml was obtained at 10 h with 50 g/L of peptone supplementation. From the batch kinetics data, it was shown that nattokinase production was growth-associated and culture should be harvested before stationary phase for maximum nattokinase production. In fed-batch culture of B. subtilis using pH-stat feeding strategy, cell growth (optical density monitored at 600 nm) increased to ca. 100 at 22 h, which was 2.5 times higher than that in batch culture. The highest nattokinase activity was 7100 unit/ml at 19 h, which was also 2.1 times higher than that in batch culture.
2055209622	Human lymphocytes that have been heat-inactivated (1 hr, 45 degrees C) were used as stimulator cells in a model system to study the requirements of allogeneic T cell activation in vitro. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes were not generated in either primary or secondary mixed lymphocyte cultures after exposure to heated stimulator cells. Successful reconstitution of cytolytic activity in primary cultures was achieved by the addition of rIL-2. Further, cytotoxic T cell lines could be maintained in culture for several weeks by stimulation with heated allogeneic cells and periodic addition of exogenous IL-2. The cytotoxic T cells generated in primary cultures or in the T cell lines were specific for the HLA class I antigens of the stimulating cells. Thus, the combination of heated cells and IL-2 stimulated antigen-specific cytotoxic cells, and not merely lymphokine-activated killers. Although IL-2 production appeared to be a crucial missing component of MLCs with heated lymphocytes, the addition of IL-1, a factor known to act as a second signal for stimulating IL-2 production, did not reconstitute cytolytic activity. These results indicate that (1) heat treatment does not appreciably affect class I structure; (2) HLA class I/T cell receptor interactions are intact, resulting in responsiveness to IL-2 but not IL-1; and (3) heating creates a defect that has a minimal effect on CTL precursor activation but does disrupt a T helper cell/stimulator cell interaction critical for IL-2 production.
2055209649	Abstract The generality of age-related changes in concanavalin A (Con A)-mediated red blood cell (RBC) adsorption to human diploid fibroblasts was investigated on fibroblast-like cells from fetal lung, heart, liver, skin and muscle tissues. All the cells examined showed the continuous increase from early passages in RBC adsorption with the RBC coating method (in which Con A-coated RBCs are adsorbed to fibroblasts) and the increase only at phase III with the fibroblast coating method (in which RBCs are adsorbed to Con A-coated fibroblasts). All of the four strains of lung fibroblasts gave nearly the same extent of the age-related change in RBC adsorption, when expressed as a function of percentage life span consumed, indicating that the change in RBC adsorption is independent of genetic heterogeneity and the conditions of primary culture. Liver and heart fibroblasts also gave results similar to those of lung fibroblasts. However, skin and muscle fibroblasts were lower in their RBC adsorption capacity throughout the life span. The continuous age-related increase in RBC adsorption to these cells could be sensitized by using glutaraldehyde-prefixed RBCs, trypsinized RBCs or phytohemagglutinin P in place of Con A. The relevance of the phenotype of in vitro aging revealed by RBC adsorption to in vivo aging was also demonstrated on skin fibroblasts from different ages of donors using glutaraldehyde-prefixed RBCs. In addition, fibroblasts from patients with Werner's syndrome, an hereditary disease manifested by early and widespread degenerative changes, showed senescent phenotype in RBC adsorption even at early passages.
2055209673	SUMMARY: The Clarke-Carbon colony bank containing ColEl-Escherichia coli hybrid plasmids was screened by conjugation for complementation of the citrate synthase lesion of a gltA mutant. Three ColEl---gltA+ plasmids were identified: pLC26--17 (16·3 kilobase pairs), pLC27--18 (16·35 kb) and pLC31--28 (26·0 kb). The citrate synthase activities of strains containing the hybrid plasmids were amplified 3- to 10-fold. Genetic studies indicated that the smaller plasmids may contain at least part of the succinate dehydrogenase gene (sdh). A physical map of a 19·4 kb region of the E. coli chromosome containing the citrate synthase gene (gltA) was constructed by restriction analysis with the isolated plasmids. The relative positions of 20 restriction sites were defined and a region (3·1 kb) containing the gltA+ gene was identified in the segment common to all three plasmids.
2055209686	Background  MSSPs, mycsingle strand binding proteins, were originally identified as proteins recognizing a putative replication origin/transcriptional enhancer in the human c-Myc gene. The cDNAs encoding four of the family proteins, MSSP-1, MSSP-2, Scr2 and Scr3, were cloned. These proteins carry two copies of the putative RNA binding domains, RNP-A and RNP-B, and have been suggested to participate in DNA replication and cell cycle progression from the G1 to the S phase.    Results  We report that MSSP-1 and MSSP-2 bound directly to the C-terminal portion of c-Myc, along with Max, side by side. MSSP, c-Myc and Max formed a ternary complex in vivo, although MSSP did not directly associate with Max. The MSSP/Myc/Max ternary complex lost the binding activity to the E-box sequence—the recognition sequence of c-Myc/Max complex—thereby abrogating the E-box-dependent transcription activity of c-Myc. MSSP specifically stimulated the cooperative transforming activity of c-myc with ras, in a manner dependent upon the RNP sequences, while mssp itself showed no transforming activity in mouse NIH3T3 cells. The NIH3T3 transformants, together with ras, myc and mssp, grew to form very large colonies in soft agar, as compared to those with ras plus myc or ras alone.    Conclusions  MSSP is a modulator of c-Myc and the c-Myc/MSSP complex may deregulate cell cycle controls and lead cells towards transforming pathways.
2055209723	Abstract Five mature ileorectal anastomosed blue foxes (6.18±0.15 kg) were used in digestibility experiments to evaluate the L-carnitine apparent ileal absorption from diets used in reproductive polar fox nutrition over the year-long farm-feeding period on two domestic farms (A and B) differing in reproduction results. The concentration of L-carnitine was higher in diets from farm B (136.1–241.7 mg kg−1 DM) than in the diets from farm A (88.5–135.2 mg kg−1 DM). The coefficients of ileal apparent absorption of L-carnitine ranged from 60.23 to 75.57% for diets A (farm A) composed mainly of fish and poultry offals. The coefficients of ileal apparent digestibility of L-carnitine were higher for diets B (farm B) (83.75–94.78%; P<0.05) based on beef offals. These data indicate high concentration and efficient ileal apparent absorption of L-carnitine from diets used in reproductive polar fox nutrition on both farms examined.
2055209780	The recombinant plasmid dpTa1 has an insert of relic wheat DNA that represents a family of tandemly organized DNA sequences with a monomeric length of approximately 340 bp. This insert was used to investigate the structural organization of this element in the genomes of 58 species within the tribe Triticeae and in 7 species representing other tribes of the Poaceae. The main characteristic of the genomic organization of dpTa1 is a classical ladder-type pattern which is typical for tandemly organized sequences. The dpTa1 sequence is present in all of the genomes of the Triticeae species examined and in 1 species from a closely related tribe (Bromus inermis, Bromeae). DNA from Hordelymus europaeus (Triticeae) did not hybridize under the standard conditions used in this study. Prolonged exposure was necessary to obtain a weak signal. Our data suggest that the dpTa1 family is quite old in evolutionary terms, probably more ancient than the tribe Triticeae. The dpTa1 sequence is more abundant in the D-genome of wheat than in other genomes in Triticeae. DNA from several species also have bands in addition to the tandem repeats. The dpTa1 sequence contains short direct and inverted subrepeats and is homologous to a tandemly repeated DNA sequence from Hordeum chilense.
2055209798	Leukotrienes (LTs) are potent mediators of bronchial inflammation and are predominantly produced by myeloid cells. As myelocytic cells differentiate towards either eosinophils or neutrophils, the profile of leukotrienes they produce upon stimulation diverges. Eosinophils produce mainly cysteinyl leukotrienes whereas neutrophils predominantly synthesize 5(S),12(R)-dihydroxy-6,8,10,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTB4). The mechanism by which this change in leukotriene composition occurs is unknown. In this study, we investigated the control of leukotriene biosynthetic enzymes during myeloid cell differentiation. Western-blot analyses of myelocytic leukemia cell lines, HL-60#7 and HL-60, differentiated towards eosinophilic or neutrophilic cell types, respectively, demonstrated that as myelocytic cells differentiate towards eosinophils or neutrophils, the protein levels of cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2) remain constant, whereas 5-lipoxygenase and 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP) levels are simultaneously elevated. As myelocytic cells become more eosinophil-like, 5(S)-hydroxy-6(R)-S -glutathionyl-7,9-trans-11,14-cis-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTC4) synthase activity and expression of both the protein and messenger RNA in the cells are dramatically increased (approximately 75-fold), while the LTC4 synthase level and activity in neutrophil-like cells remain constant at very low levels. In contrast, in neutrophilic cells, the amount of 5,6-oxido-7,9,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (LTA4) hydrolase was elevated approximately 100-fold greater than the increase in LTA4 hydrolase from eosinophilic cells. These results indicate that as a myeloid cell differentiates towards a granulocyte, similar mechanisms of regulation may be applied to the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway up to the point at which the pathway diverges. At the stage in the leukotriene biosynthetic pathway where LTA4 may be converted to either LTC4 or to LTB4, specific regulators of transcription may become activated as a myelocytic cell differentiates, thereby causing increased LTA4 hydrolase or LTC4 synthase expression.
2055209800	In wild and cultivated annual plant species, flowering time is an important life-history trait that coordinates the life cycle with local environmental conditions. Extensive studies on the genetic basis of flowering time in the model species Arabidopsis thaliana have revealed a complex genetic network that can detect environmental and internal signals. Based on this knowledge and on known pleiotropic effects associated with flowering time genes, we suggest that a natural shift towards an early-flowering life cycle might involve only particular functional regions in a limited number of genes. Our predictions are supported by genetic theories of adaptation and by recent data about genes associated with natural variation. We analyse the extent to which these predictions can also apply to crop species.
2055209830	After two-thirds hepatectomy, normally quiescent liver cells are stimulated to reenter the cell cycle and proliferate to restore the original liver mass. The level of bZIP transcription factor CCAAT enhancer-binding protein beta (C/EBPbeta) increases in the liver during the period of cell proliferation. The significance of this change in C/EBP expression is not understood. To determine the role of C/EBPbeta in the regenerating liver, we examined the regenerative response after partial hepatectomy in mice that contain a targeted disruption of the C/EBPbeta gene. Posthepatectomy, hepatocyte DNA synthesis was decreased to 25% of normal in C/EBPbeta -/- mice. The reduced regenerative response was associated with a prolonged period of hypoglycemia that was independent of expression of C/EBPalpha protein and gluconeogenic genes. C/EBPbeta -/- livers showed reduced expression of immediate-early growth-control genes including the Egr-1 transcription factor, mitogen-activated protein kinase protein tyrosine phosphatase (MKP-1), and HRS, a delayed-early gene that encodes an mRNA splicing protein. Cyclin B and E gene expression were dramatically reduced in C/EBPbeta -/- livers whereas cyclin D1 expression was normal. The abnormalities in immediate-early gene expression in C/EBPbeta -/- livers were distinct from those seen in IL-6 -/- livers. These data link C/EBPbeta to the activation of metabolic and growth response pathways in the regenerating liver and demonstrate that C/EBPbeta is required for a normal proliferative response.
2055209843	Four species of Biuterina Fuhrmann, 1902 (Cestoda, Cyclophyllidea, Paruterinidae), originally described from Afrotropical passeriform birds, are redescribed and figured on the basis of their type-specimens. These are B. pentamyzos (Mettrick, 1960) from Prionops plumata (Laniidae) in Zimbabwe, B. quelea (Mettrick, 1963) from Quelea quelea (Ploceidae) in Zimbabwe, B. ugandae Baylis, 1919 from Chalcomitra senegalensis (Nectariniidae) in Uganda and B. zambiensis (Mettrick, 1960) from Campephaga flava (Campephagidae) in Zimbabwe. The rostellum of B. quelea is a spherical structure filled with strongly-developed glandular tissue and possessing a weak musculature. The remaining three species have a sucker-like rostellar apparatus with moderately developed glandular tissue in the rostellum and around it. It is considered that the glandular elements are an inherent part of the rostellar apparatus of the paruterinids. An armament consisting of fine, punctiform, spine-like structures arranged in transverse rows on the inner surface of suckers is observed in B. pentamyzos. This is the first record of sucker armature in the Paruterinidae.
2055209895	Chick embryo cells infected with an influenza A (fowl plague) virus have been labelled with (3H)-uridine for different lengths of time. Virion RNA and cellular RNA have been separated by specific hybridization with a surplus of unlabelled viral complementary RNA and RNase digestion. The ratio of the specific radioacticity in the UMP and CMP moieties of both types of RNA has been determined. Since the rate of approach to equilibrium of CMP to UMP labelling of both types of RNA is completely different it is concluded that cellular and virion RNA are synthesized using different pyrimidine nucleoside triphosphate pools.
2055210046	To evaluate mercury (Hg) exposure and possible adverse effects of Hg on American dipper (Cinclus mexicanus) reproduction, we collected eggs and nestling feathers and the larval/nymph form of three Orders of aquatic macroinvertebrates (Ephemeroptera, Plecoptera and Trichoptera = EPT) important in their diet from three major headwater tributaries of the upper Willamette River, Oregon in 2002. The Coast Fork Willamette River is contaminated with Hg due to historical cinnabar (HgS) mining at the Black Butte Mine; the Row River is affected by past gold-mining operations located within the Bohemia Mining District, where Hg was used in the amalgamation process to recover gold; and the Middle Fork Willamette River is the reference area with no known mining. Methyl mercury (MeHg) concentrations (geometric mean) in composite EPT larvae (111.9 ng/g dry weight [dw] or 19.8 ng/g wet weight [ww]), dipper eggs (38.5 ng/g ww) and nestling feathers (1158 ng/g ww) collected from the Coast Fork Willamette were significantly higher than MeHg concentrations in EPT and dipper samples from other streams. Total mercury (THg) concentrations in surface sediments along the same Hg-impacted streams were investigated by others in 1999 (Row River tributaries) and 2002 (Coast Fork). The reported sediment THg concentrations paralleled our biological findings. Dipper breeding territories at higher elevations had fewer second clutches; however, dipper reproductive success along all streams (including the lower elevation and most Hg-contaminated Coast Fork), was judged excellent compared to other studies reviewed. Furthermore, MeHg concentrations in EPT samples from this study were well below dietary concentrations in other aquatic bird species, such as loons and ducks, reported to cause Hg-related reproductive problems. Our data suggest that either dipper feathers or EPT composites used to project MeHg concentrations in dipper feathers (with biomagnification factor of 10–20×) may be used, but with caution, to screen headwater streams for potential Hg-related effects on dippers. When actual feather concentrations or projected feather concentrations are equal to or lower than concentrations reported for the Coast Fork, dippers are expected to reproduce well (assuming adequate prey and suitable nest sites). When Hg concentrations are substantially higher, more detailed investigations may be required. Birds feeding almost exclusively on fish (e.g., osprey [Pandion haliaetus]) and usually found further downstream from the headwaters would not be adequately represented by dippers given the higher MeHg concentrations in fish resulting from biomagnification, compared to lower trophic level invertebrates.
2055210086	The bacterial cyclic nucleotide gated (bCNG) ion channel family contains a N-terminal channel domain, which is homologous to the Mechanosensitive Channel of Small Conductance (MscS) and a ligand binding domain with sequence similarity to known cyclic nucleotide binding domains. Previously, we have demonstrated that some of these channels gate in response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate alone [Caldwell, et al, BBA 2010, 1798, 1750-1756]. Here we explore the ability of bCNG channels to gate in response to mechanical stress, which one might predict based on their significant sequence homology to MscS. To this end, we measured the ability of fourteen distinct bCNG channels from several different bacterial strains to rescue E. coli lacking mechanosensitive channels (MscS/MscL/MscK null) from osmotic downshock. In our studies, only two bCNG channels exhibit limited ability to rescue bacteria from osmotic downshock. These two channels were found in bacterial strains with genomes encoding for multiple variants of the bCNG gene. Only one bCNG channel variant in each strain was capable of rescuing E.coli from osmotic downshock, implying that each gene product may have a unique role or that the two gene products may work in concert. Additionally, truncation of the cyclic nucleotide binding domain in some non-mechanosensitive variants of bCNG increases their response to mechanical stress.
2055210192	"Retroviruses have evolved effective strategies to evade the host immune response, such as high variability and latent infection. In addition, primate lentiviruses, such as HIV-1, have acquired several «accessory» genes that antagonize antiviral host restriction factors and facilitate viral immune evasion, thereby allowing continuous and efficient viral replication despite apparently strong innate and acquired immune responses. Here, I summarize some of our current knowledge on the function of the viral vpu and nef genes, with a particular focus on their capability to antagonize an antiviral factor named ""tetherin"" (BST-2) that tethers nascent virions at the cell surface. Evidence will be presented that switches between Nef- and Vpu-mediated tetherin antagonism preceded the emergence of HIV-1. Furthermore, it will be discussed why tetherin most likely poses a significant hurdle to cross-species transmissions of simian immunodeficiency viruses to humans. To our current knowledge only pandemic HIV-1 M (major) strains mastered this barrier perfectly by,,regaining"" efficient tetherin activity by Vpu following the four independent cross-species transmissions that resulted in HIV-1 groups M, O, N, and P. This may potentially explain why HIV-1 M it is almost entirely responsible for the HIV/AIDS pandemic."
2055210215	Abstract Breeding experiments with Rattus rattus indicate that the inheritance of resistance to the rodenticide warfarin has a multifactorial basis. In resistant × resistant and resistant × susceptible crosses between wild-caught rats, averages of 25 and 17% respectively of the offspring were resistant. In F 1 backcrosses to the susceptible, less than 1% were resistant. Susceptible rats bred true. Significant inter-family variation was observed in resistant crosses. The implications of the results for the development and containment of resistant populations in the field are discussed.
2055210216	Bone morphogenetic protein-7 (BMP-7), a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta superfamily of signaling cytokines, induces dendritic growth in rat sympathetic neurons. In this study, we present evidence that the recently discovered integrative nuclear FGFR1 signaling (INFS) pathway is involved in dendrite outgrowth mediated by BMP-7. Immunocytochemical analysis of expressed fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) showed that little FGF-2 was detected in control neurons, but the expression of this molecule in the cytoplasm and nucleus increased within 6 h after BMP-7 treatment. In contrast, FGF-1 was constitutively present in the peripheral cytoplasm and in neurites under control conditions, and its distribution did not change with BMP-7 exposure. The high-affinity receptor FGFR1 was present in low amounts in control neurons and was associated with the cytoplasm, the plasma membrane, and the nucleus. Twenty-four hours of BMP-7 treatment elicited an increase in FGFR1 nuclear localization. Overexpressed constructs of FGFR1 that lack the tyrosine kinase domain, and have been shown to act in a dominant-negative manner on FGFR1 signaling, inhibited BMP-7 mediated initial dendrite outgrowth in transfected neurons by approximately 50%. However, targeted inhibition of extracellular FGF-2 by overexpression of a secreted receptor mutant FGFR1(TM-) lacking the transmembrane domain failed to affect BMP-7 induced dendritic growth, as did treatment with the extracellular FGFR antagonist inositol hexakisphosphate. These results suggest that the INFS, which has already been implicated in a broad range of activities in other cell types, may also be required for BMP-7 to stimulate dendritic development.
2055210240	Abstract Odour emanating from anaerobic lagoons and swine production facilities has increased the tension among rural neighbors and among urban and rural residents. Storage of swine manure is associated with the production of a variety of odorous compounds, including ammonia, organic acids and alcohols, and sulphides. Although the generation of these chemicals is the result of microbiological activity, little is known about the types of microorganisms responsible for their production. We have initiated an approach to determine and compare the bacterial populations present in both pig faeces and manure storage pits. Total DNA was isolated from both of these ecosystems. DNA sequence analyses of PCR amplified 16S rDNA genes derived from eubacterial sequences were carried out. Similarity analyses of the 16S sequences indicated the presence of primarily low G + C Gram-positive bacteria, such as Clostridium sp., Streptococcus sp., and Lactobacillus sp. in both ecosystems. Many of the sequences were from unidentified microorganisms. These results indicate that the primary eubacteria identified in swine faeces and manure pits are low G + C, Gram-positive bacteria.
2055210265	A longitudinal study to identify the species of Liriomyza leafminer, their distribution, relative abundance, and seasonal variation, including their host range, was conducted in vegetable fields at three altitudes in Kenya from November 2011 to November 2012. Three main species were identified: Liriomyza huidobrensis (Blanchard), Liriomyza sativae Blanchard, and Liriomyza trifolii (Burgess), of which L. huidobrensis was the most abundant across all altitudes irrespective of the cropping season and accounting for over 90% of the total Liriomyza specimens collected. Liriomyza species were collected from all infested incubated leaves of 20 crops surveyed belonging to seven families: Fabaceae, Solanaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Malvaceae, Brassicaceae, Amaranthaceae, and Amaryllidaceae. However, more than 87.5% of the Liriomyza species were obtained from only four of these crops: Pisum sativum L., Phaseolus vulgaris L., Solanum lycopersicum L., and Solanum tuberosum, thereby demonstrating that Fabaceae and Solonaceae crops are the most important hosts with regard to Liriomyza species richness and relative abundance. L. huidobrensis had the widest host range (20 crops), followed by L. sativae (18 crops) and L. trifolii (12 crops). Although L. trifolii has been considered the dominant Liriomyza leafminer in Kenya, this study suggests that this may not be the case anymore, as L. huidobrensis dominates at all altitudes.
2055210299	AbstractThe present work deals with hormonal regulation of growth and antheridial formation in male clones in three dioecious mosses, Barbula gregaria (Mitt.) Jaeg., Bryum coronatum Schwaegr. and Philonotis turneriana Schwaegr. (Mitt.). Barbula and Bryum develop antheridia in ordinary cultural conditions on basal medium, whereas Philonotis remains sterile. Of the three phytohormones tested, IAA increases antheridial production as well as the number of gametophores in Bryum and Barbula, but its effect on antheridial formation is more striking. GA3 enhances antheridial induction and vegetative growth in the three mosses. Its effect on antheridial induction is more striking in Philonotis than in Barbula and Bryum. Kinetin is more effective in enhancing the number of gametophores than antheridial formation in Barbula and Bryum. The two animal sex hormones, progesterone and testosterone, enhance antheridial production as well as the formation of gametophores. Except for GA3 none of the hormones tested induces ...
2055210353	Dermatophytoses caused by the genus Microsporum require a long-duration therapy compared to infections caused by other genera. Treatment of these cutaneous infections includes topical and systemic antifungal agents. Tinea capitis and tinea unguium caused by M. canis and M. gypseum are the most difficult-to-treat dermatophytoses. There are few specific studies about corresponding antifungal susceptibility in vitro. Recently, the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute proposed the M38A document as standard to determine the minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of several antifungal agents against conidium-forming filamentous fungi; however, dermatophytes were not included in this document. This study aimed to contribute to continuing investigations concerning the optimal antifungal susceptibility testing conditions of Microsporum spp. to terbinafine, ciclopiroxolamine and griseofulvin. The results pointed out potato dextrose agar as the best culture medium for inducing conidia sporulation, inoculum density amounting to 1 x 10(3) conidia ml(-1), containing only microconidia, with an incubation time of 7 days at 28 degrees C and 100% growth inhibition serving as an endpoint. The minimum fungicidal concentration values were in accordance with the MICs values, showing a fungicidal activity of these drugs towards the tested strains. According to our results, in general, terbinafine was more active than griseofulvin and ciclopiroxolamine.
2055210356	"We have shown previously that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) acts as a survival factor for cerebellar granule cell neurons in culture, as well as protecting them against glutamate toxicity. In this study we have examined effects of PEDF on apoptotic cell death. We find that the granule cells die of apoptosis throughout the culture period, what we have termed ""natural"" apoptosis. PEDF prevents this natural apoptosis if added to immature cells, within the first 2 days in vitro (DIV), and the effect is maintained for up to DIV12. However, PEDF has no effect if added to mature cells at DIV5. Similar results are obtained when apoptosis is induced by shifting the cells from a serum- and 25 mM KCl-containing medium to serum-free medium with 5 mM KCl. PEDF most effectively blocks induced apoptosis in immature cells (DIV2) when added 24 hr prior to the change of medium, but still provides some protection when added simultaneously. However, 24 hr pretreatment with PEDF has a minimal effect when apoptosis is induced in mature DIV6 cells; addition at the same time is completely ineffective. Two polypeptide fragments of PEDF, only one of which contains the serine-protease inhibitory site, are equally active, supporting previous results which suggest that the neurotrophic effects of PEDF are not mediated by protease inhibition. We conclude that PEDF protects immature but not mature granule cells against both natural and induced apoptosis."
2055210379	A new isolate of Rice tungro bacilliform virus (RTBV) was collected from Chinsura, West Bengal, India. The full genome was sequenced and deposited to GenBank designating the new one as Chinsura isolate. The four open reading frames (ORFs) of the new isolate were compared with those of previously reported ‘South-east Asian’ (SEA) and ‘South Asian’ (SA) isolates emphasizing the ORF3, which is the largest and functionally most important gene of RTBV. In the ORFs, Chinsura isolate shared 90.0–100.0% identity at amino acid level with SA isolates, but only 58.76–88.63% identity with SEA isolates for the same. Similarly, the amino acid identity of ORFs between SEA and SA isolates ranged from 58.77 to 88.64, whereas within each group the corresponding value was >96.0%. The phylogenetic analysis based on nucleotide and amino acid sequences of each ORF made two broad clusters of SEA- and SA-types including Chinsura isolate within SA cluster. Moreover, the relative positions and length of functional domains corresponding to movement protein (MP), coat protein (CP), aspartate protease (PR) and reverse transcriptase/ribonuclease H (RT/RNase H) of ORF3 of Chinsura isolate were completely identical with SA isolates. The clustering pattern indicated strong influence of geographical habitat on genomic evolution. Comparison of ORF3 among all the isolates revealed major variations at non-functional regions in between the functional domains and at the hypervariable 3′-terminal end of ORF3, while PR appeared to have evolved differentially in SA isolates expecting further characterization.
2055210422	The phragmoplast is a special apparatus that functions in establishing a cell plate in dividing plant cells. It is known that microfilaments (MFs) are involved in constituting phragmoplast structure, but the dynamic distribution and role of phragmoplast MFs are far from being understood. In this study, the precise structure and dynamics of MFs during the initiation and the late lateral expansion of the phragmoplast were observed by using a tobacco BY-2 cell line stably expressing the microfilament reporter construct GFP-fABD2. Three-dimensional imaging showed that the phragmoplast MFs were initiated by two populations of MFs emerging between the reconstituting daughter nuclei at anaphase, which migrated to the mid-zone and gave rise to two layers of microfilament arrays. FM4-64 stained vesicles accumulated and fused with the cell plate between the two populations of MFs. The two layers of microfilament arrays of phragmoplast with ends overlapped always surrounded the centrifugally expanding cell plate. Partial disruption of MFs at metaphase by low concentration of latrunculin B resulted in the inhibition of the cell plate consolidation and the blockage of cell plate lateral expansion, whereas high concentration of latrunculin B restrained the progression of the cell cycle. Treating the cell after the initiation of phragmoplast led to the cease of the expansion of the cell plate. Our observations provide new insights into the precise structure and dynamics of phragmoplast MFs during cytokinesis and suggest that dynamic phragmoplast MFs are important in cell plate formation.
2055210467	The enteric nervous system (ENS) has been explored by developmental neurobiologists and medical researchers for decades. Whereas developmental biologists have been unravelling the molecular mechanisms underlying the migration, proliferation and differentiation of the neural crest derivatives that give rise to the ENS, human geneticists have been uncovering the genetic basis for diseases of the ENS, notably Hirschsprung's disease. Here we discuss the exciting recent advances, including novel transgenic and genetic tools, a broadening range of model organisms, and the pursuit of ENS stem cells as a therapeutic tool, that are bringing these fields closer together.
2055210502	In this work, we evaluated the capacity of a fungal transfer RNA (F-tRNA) from Aspergillus niger to protect HEp-2 cells against a viral infection, and as an inducer of IFN-beta synthesis. HEp-2 cells previously incubated with F-tRNA, polyI:polyC, or IFN-alpha, at different concentrations for 24 h were infected with 200 pfu of adenovirus type 6 (AdV-6); after 5 days, we determined cellular viability, cytopathic effect of the virus, optimal concentration necessary to inhibit the cytopathic effect, and IFN-beta expression by RT-PCR. Results showed that HEp-2 cells treated with F-tRNA were less susceptible to the cytopathic effect of AdV-6 infection than those incubated with polyI:polyC (p < 0.05). On the other hand, F-tRNA- treated HEp-2 cells expressed IFN-beta mRNA, whereas monolayers incubated with polyI:polyC or IFN-alpha did not. Our results suggest that F-tRNA protected HEp-2 cells against AdV-6 infection, due to its capacity to induce IFN-beta synthesis.
2055210507	Repair of DNA double-strand breaks by homologous recombination requires an extensive set of proteins. Among these proteins are Rad51 and Mre11, which are known to re-localize to sites of DNA damage into nuclear foci. Ionizing radiation-induced foci can be visualized by immuno-staining. Published data show a large variation in the number of foci-positive cells and number of foci per nucleus for specific DNA repair proteins. The experiments described here demonstrate that the time after induction of DNA damage influenced not only the number of foci-positive cells, but also the size of the individual foci. The dose of ionizing radiation influenced both the number of foci-positive cells and the number of foci per nucleus. Furthermore, ionizing radiation-induced foci formation depended on the cell cycle stage of the cells and the protein of interest that was investigated. Rad51 and Mre11 foci seemed to be mutually exclusive, though a small subset of cells did show co-localization of these proteins, which suggests a possible cooperation between the proteins at a specific moment during DNA repair.
2055210535	Long interspersed nuclear elements 1 (L1 elements or LINE1) are the most active autonomous retrotransposons in mammalian genomes. In addition to L1 elements themselves, other protein-coding mRNAs can also be reverse transcribed and integrated into the genome through the L1-mediated retrotransposition, leading to the formation of processed pseudogenes (PPs) and retrogenes, both of which are characterized by the lack of introns and the presence of a 3' polyA tract and flanking direct repeats. PPs are unable to encode a functional protein and have accumulated frameshift mutations and premature stop codons during evolution. A few of PPs are transcriptionally active. Retrogenes preserve undisrupted coding frames and are capable of encoding a functional protein that is identical or nearly identical to that of the progenitor gene. There is a significant excess of retrogenes that originate from the X chromosome and are retrotransposed into autosomes, and most of these retrogenes are specially expressed in male germ cells, suggesting the inactivation of X-linked genes during male meiosis provides a strong selection pressure on retrogenes originating from the X chromosome.
2055210552	The effect of a lack of the gene encoding monoamine oxidase A (MAO A) in transgenic Tg8 mice on the activity of tryptophan hydroxylase (TPH), the rate-limiting enzyme in serotonin (5-HT) biosynthesis, and on the levels of 5-HT and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in the midbrain, hypothalamus, hippocampus, striatum, amygdala, and frontal cortex was studied. It was shown that mice with a genetic MAO A knockout differed from mice of the initial C3H/HeJ strain in having a higher level of 5-HT and a lower level of its metabolite, 5-HIAA, in all brain regions but the frontal cortex, where the changes were insignificant. Although the 5-HIAA/5-HT ratio in various brain regions differed considerably, the decrease of the 5-HT oxidative deamination index in Tg8 mice was similar in different brain regions (to 41-45% of control values), with the exception of the frontal cortex, where the decrease of the 5-HIAA/5-HT was somewhat smaller (to 54%). The presence of the remaining 45% +/- 1.9% of the control ratio value indicates rather effective oxidative deamination of 5-HT in MAO A knockout mice and explains the lack of severe behavioral and pathological consequences in MAO A genetic deficiency. An increase of TPH activity in mice lacking MAO A was found in the frontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. No significant changes were found in the striatum, hypothalamus, and midbrain. The data show an effect of the MAO A gene mutation on TPH and indicate a uniform decrease of 5-HT catabolism in different brain regions except for the frontal cortex, which is somewhat more resistant to the lack of MAO A than other brain structures.
2055210574	The aim of this study was to investigate causes of the short estrous cycles that occur frequently in dairy cows after estrus synchronization using PGF2α and GnRH. Expression of oxytocin receptor (OR), progesterone receptor (PR), and estrogen receptor (ER); of cyclo-oxygenase II (COX-II) and 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (20α-HSD); and of peripheral blood estradiol-17s and progesterone (P4) concentrations were analyzed in estrous cycles of normal length and in induced short estrous cycles. On Day 8 (ovulation = Day 0), presynchronized dairy cows (n = 14) were given 0.15 mg of dexcloprostenol and 0.1 mg of gonadorelin 24 hours later. Animals were bled once daily for P4 and estradiol-17s analyses, and endometrial biopsy specimens were taken on Days 2 and 5 for PR, ER, OR, 20α-HSD, and COX-II determinations with immunohistochemistry and/or real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR). Ovulations and ovarian structures were monitored with transrectal ultrasound daily until the next ovulation. After excluding one case of incomplete luteal regression, short estrous cycles occurred in 8 of 13 cases (length from 8 to 12 days). No differences were established in endometrial ER, PR, or COX-II expression between the normal and short cycle groups in the semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry analysis. In qRT-PCR analysis, no differences were found in relative gene expression of endometrial ER, PR, OR, 20α-HSD, or COX-II between normal and short cycles. Despite evidence from previous studies that short estrous cycles are induced by premature prostaglandin release, differences in these receptors or in enzyme expression do not explain the release.
2055210622	Summary The inconsistency in Lotka's stable population model (two different intrinsic growth rates for the two sexes) arises from the fact that he considers two equations (for male and female births), and not because his equation for one sex does not involve the other. Many authors in the past have erroneously put emphasis on the latter point and modified Lotka's equations for male and female births. Since sex ratio at birth is constant, two independent equations for male and female births cannot exist. The correct approach is to attempt to form an equation for all births. The author followed this approach in his earlier works on the problem, but his birth functions were formulated from axiomatic considerations. The present paper provides a new birth function which has an intuitively appealing physical interpretation, and for which the interaction between the sexes is empirically determined from the data.
2055210633	During ovarian maturation in the crayfish Cherax quadricarinatus, changes in ovarian protein kinase C (PKC) isoenzymes take place in parallel to yolk accumulation (as shown by immunoblot analysis). Significant changes were recorded in the amounts of specific isoenzymes and in their distribution between the cytosol and the membranes. Ovarian maturation was accompanied by the appearance of high- and low-molecular-weight immunoreactive PKC isoenzyme species. Among the isoenzymes tested, PKC a was the most clearly activated during ovarian maturation, as shown by significant translocation from the cytosol to the particulate fraction and the appearance of high-molecular-weight species. Moreover, a similar picture was obtained in the ovaries of intersex individuals upon induction of secondary vitellogenesis by androgenic gland ablation. Immunohistological staining showed PKC a to be localized mainly in the cytosol of premature oocytes, whereas in later maturation stages, it was concentrated around the nucleus in a vesicular structure and in the oocyte membrane. In secondary vitellogenic stages, PKC was localized in the plasma membrane and apparently in follicular cells. In addition, its activity was demonstrated by in vitro phosphorylation assays of a crayfish ovarian homogenate. Activation of total PKC phosphorylation of histone, an external substrate, was induced by phosphatidylserine plus 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) or methyl farnesoate. Both TPA and methyl farnesoate stimulated activation of PKC a in organ culture, causing its translocation from the cytosol to the membranes and inducing autophosphorylation of threonine residues. The changes in PKC isoenzymes during ovarian maturation in the crayfish suggest their involvement in this process as well as a possible regulatory role for methyl farnesoate through a direct effect on some PKC isoenzymes. © 2000 Academic Press
2055210651	A study of the development of the sense organs of the larva of Botryllus schlosseri to determine, if possible, any homologies between its sense organs and those of other types of ascidians such as Molgula and Ammaroucium, which have sense organs structurally very different.    The statolith appears in the Botryllus embryo as a single club-shaped cell. The lightsensitive organs have their primordia slightly later as five small filaments, each developed from a ganglion cell. A cavity appears in the statolith into which the light-sensitive filaments penetrate. Later development is concerned with pigmentation of the statolith, and a twisting process which orients it into the position in which it is found in the free-swimming larva. The three tactile papillae develop from evaginations of ectoderm at the anterior end of the embryo. The ectodermal cells at the center of a papilla are differentiated into rod-shaped sensory receptors and ganglion-like masses of nerve tissue. Nervous connections are established between these peripheral ganglia and the central nervous system.    Results of the investigation indicate that the statoliths of the different ascidian larvae are homologous; the direction eyes probably are not, but have evolved independently from a light-sensitive area in the primitive larva of a common ancestral ascidian. The larvae of Molgula and Ammaroucium possess no structures comparable to the sensory papillae of Botryllus.
2055210668	The physiological decline that occurs with aging is thought to result, in part, from accumulation of oxidative damage produced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during normal metabolism. Two genetic mouse models of aging, the Ames dwarf and growth hormone (GH) transgenic, suggest that hormone levels may play a role in antioxidative defense and aging. To explore this possibility, catalase (CAT), an enzyme involved in elimination of ROS, was evaluated in long-lived dwarf and short-lived transgenic mice. Catalase activity and/or protein was significantly elevated in livers from dwarf mice at 3, 6, 13-15, and 24 months of age when compared to age-matched wild type mice. In contrast, a 50 and 38% reduction (P < 0.05) in CAT protein was observed in 3 and 10 to 12 month old GH transgenics respectively, when compared to wild type mice. Kidneys from old dwarf mice exhibited significantly increased CAT activity (22%), protein (16%) and mRNA expression (59%) compared to wild type mice. Conversely, kidneys from GH transgenic mice showed reductions in CAT activity. The results of this study suggest that hormonal status modulates antioxidative mechanisms and that CAT is important in overall defense capacity with respect to lifespan in both decelerated (dwarf) and accelerated (transgenic) mammalian models of aging.
2055210717	Abstract Experiments were carried out to evaluate two systems: (1) premunition and (2) chemoprophylaxis for the control of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis in the Cauca River Valley, Colombia. Control of these diseases was achieved by inoculating cattle with virulent Babesia bigemina, Babesia argentina , and Anaplasma marginale and subsequent treatment with Imidocarb and Gloxazone to moderate the postpremunition reactions. Chemoprophylactic treatment with Imidocarb and Gloxazone was administered to cattle before and during field exposure. Premunized cattle were highly resistant to tick-borne ( Boophilus microplus ) challenge. Imidocarb had therapeutic and chemoprophylactic properties against babesiosis, but appeared toxic. Gloxazone moderated the A. marginale postpremunition reaction, but failed to prevent clinical anaplasmosis under the conditions of this investigation.
2055210731	The association of class I and II HLA antigens with rheumatic fever and its manifestations was examined in 72 patients, including 48 blacks and 24 Caucasians. No significant association was found between class I antigens and rheumatic fever. In contrast, HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR4 phenotypes were encountered in a significantly higher frequency in black and Caucasian patients with rheumatic fever, respectively, compared with the control populations (P less than 0.005). The most significant association (P less than 0.005) of these DR antigens with a major manifestation of rheumatic fever was found for mitral insufficiency. In addition, a significant association was encountered between persistent elevation of antibody to the group A streptococcal carbohydrate and HLA-DR4 in Caucasian patients (P less than 0.04) or HLA-DR2 in the black patients (P less than 0.001). The frequency of HLA-DR2/4 heterozygotes among patients with rheumatic fever did not differ significantly from controls. These findings support the concept of a genetically determined susceptibility to rheumatic fever and, particularly, to rheumatic heart disease. The association of the clinical manifestations of rheumatic fever and the immune hyperresponsiveness to a streptococcal antigen could be ascribed to a disease-associated immune-response gene which is in linkage disequilibrium with the DR2 and DR4 alleles of HLA-DR locus on chromosome six.
2055210749	Chlamydial infections of the genital organs cause reproductive failure in female pigs, and the uterus is recognized a target tissue for an infection. In contrast, information on the effect of chlamydiae on the porcine oviduct is patchily and inconclusive, although the bacteria are known to cause severe tubal defects in humans and laboratory animals. The aim of this study was to examine the segments ampulla (A), isthmus (I) and utero-tubal junction of the left (n = 20) or both (n = 22) oviducts, and uteri (U) from 42 culled repeat breeder pigs for chlamydiae using ompA-PCR, partial ompA gene sequencing, immunohistochemistry (IHC) and microscopy of tissue specimens for histopathology. As revealed by PCR, among a total of 26 chlamydia-positive females, 19 were tested positive in one or more segments of one or both oviducts, 14 were found positive in the uterus, and concomitant infections of both organs were observed in 7 of them. Sequencing of 33 PCR products revealed the following chlamydial species: Chlamydophila (Cp.) psittaci (n = 18), Cp. abortus (n = 2), Chlamydia (C.) suis (n = 10), and C. trachomatis (n = 3). Immunopositive staining was observed within the surface epithelium (in A, I, U), stromal tissue (in I, U) and muscular layer (in A, I, U). A total of 24 females had inflamed oviductal segments (in A and/or I) and 36 inflamed uteri. However, there was no relationship between histopathology and results of PCR or IHC. In conclusion, chlamydiae were found to infect oviducts and uteri of pigs. Further studies are required to clarify whether chlamydial infection causes specific histopathology and alters tubal function.
2055210752	In each of two experiments, 600 male broiler chicks (Ross 1) were randomised into 24 groups each containing 25 birds. From the age of seven days they were given one of six experimental diets. These were a control diet having ground wheat as the main cereal source and five other diets in which mainly the wheat was replaced by increasing amounts (100, 200, 300, 400, 500 g kg−1 diet) of dried cassava root meal. Neither body weight nor food intake were significantly affected in either experiment by the inclusion of dried cassava root meal at levels up to 500 g kg−1. Food conversion efficiency was unaffected by dietary treatment except in experiment 1 after 4 weeks, when the diet with 100 g cassava meal kg−1 resulted in a better food conversion efficiency than in the case of the other dietary treatments. The carcass and abdominal fat weights and the chemical composition of the carcasses were unaffected by dietary treatment. In the caecal contents the proportion of acetic acid was increased and that of propionic and valeric acids reduced by the inclusion of dried cassava root meal. The moisture content of the litter was not significantly affected by the presence of cassava root meal although the litter became wet and sticky in the groups given the two highest levels of cassava root meal in Experiment 1. For this reason, the maximum recommended level of inclusion of dried cassava root meal in broiler diets is 30%.
2055210797	Abstract Rat embryonic mesencephalic cultures were treated with the dopaminergic neurotoxin 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), and GM1 ganglioside added after the toxin. Twelve days after a 24-h exposure to MPP+, there was a significant decrement in tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and aromatic l -amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) activities. In addition, TH mRNA was decreased, whereas AAAD mRNA was no different from control cultures. Adding GM1 to control unlesioned cultures had no effect on TH activity or mRNA. In contrast, GM1 modestly increased both the activity and mRNA for AAAD. In the MPP+-treated cultures, GM1 induced a partial recovery of TH and AAAD activity and increased mRNA for both above unlesioned control levels. Our studies demonstrate that GM1 upregulates the synthetic enzymes for dopamine in MPP+-lesioned embryonic mesencephalic cultures, and suggest that TH and AAAD respond differentially to the neurotoxin insult.
2055210806	This study shows the rapid and differential production of the 40–43 kDa and the 70–90 kDa α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) fucosylated glycoforms after treatment of the dorsal air pouch with bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), HgCl2 or Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA). The 40–43 kDa and the 70–90 kDa AGP production is peaked 1–3 h post-LPS treatment. We observed that the responses to LPS and FCA are similar in that both AGP isoforms are induced whereas they differ in that the FCA exhibits a 6 h lag period. The response to HgCl2, however, exhibits the specific biphasic induction only of the 40–43 kDa AGP. The serum 40–43 kDa AGP glycoform gradually increases in response to all of the above stimulants and peaks by 24 h post- treatment. The increase of the 70–90 kDa AGP levels in the air pouch occurs in association with the accumulation of polymorphonuclear (PMN) cells while dexamethasone (DEX) increases only the 40–43 kDa AGP production in the absence of PMN accumulation. Macrophage–monocyte lineage cells forming the air pouch lining tissue may potentially be the cells that secrete the 40–43 kDa AGP while polymorphonuclear cells that infiltrate the air pouch secrete the 70–90 kDa AGP. The 40–43 kDa and 70–90 kDa AGP production induced by LPS in the air pouch precedes that of interleukin-1 (IL-1) or interleukin-6 (IL-6) while the 40–43 kDa AGP glycoform potentially increases IL-6 production by air pouch PMN exudate cells. These significant differences suggest a local pro-inflammatory role of AGP. Honeybee venom suppressed arthritis development and exhibited differential local or systemic regulation of AGP in serum vs. air pouch exudate or synovial fluid. This study with the air pouch model of facsimile synovium tissue suggests that local α1-acid glycoprotein (AGP) production may contribute to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory activities during the local acute phase response or during chronic inflammatory stress as in arthritis.
2055210890	Department of Environmental Horticulture, University of Seoul, Seoul 130-743, Korea(Received on June 21, 2010; Accepted on November 2, 2010)The expression of HR-like lesion inducing gene of Oryzasativa (OsHRL) was slightly increased by Xanthomonasoryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) infection. Transgenic rice plantsover-expressing OsHRL gene were challenged with Xooand the development of disease symptoms were examin-ed to investigate the effect of OsHRL gene expression onplant defense responses. The over-expression of OsHRLincreased disease resistance against Xoo compared withwild type plants. Keywords :avrBs2 homologue, OsHRL, rice, Xanthomonasoryzae pv. oryzaeRice is one of the most important crop species, and its yieldis constantly affected by several major diseases such asbacterial blight, blast, sheath blight, and tungro (Dai et al.,2007). Bacterial blight, caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv.oryzae (Xoo), is a serious agronomic problem in many rice-growing regions (Mew et al., 1993). Therefore, under-standing of molecular mechanisms underlying host resis-tance to pathogens is essential to develop better controllingstrategies against rice diseases. Because of availability ofthe genome sequences, rice (Sasaki et al., 2005) and Xoo(Lee et al., 2005) are considered as a model system of plantand bacterial pathogen, respectively (Li et al., 2006). It has been previous reported that the avrBs2 gene, whichwas identified in many species of Xanthomonas, encodesagrocinopine synthase and glycerol phosphodiesterase(Swords et al. 1996). The avrBs2 of Xanthomonas cam-pestris pv. vesicatoria (Xcv) is specifically recognized bypepper Bs2 resulting in localized cell death and plantresistance (Mudgett et al., 2000). We thus attempt to iden-tify avrBs2-interacting partner from rice. AvrBs2 (Kearneyand Staskawicz, 1990; Swords et al., 1996) homologue wasselected from Xoo strain KACC10859 (K1 race), based ongenomic sequences of Xoo strain KACC10331 (K1 race,Lee et al., 2005). Xoo strain KACC10859 harbors singlecopy gene of avrBs2 which is used as bait to isolate inter-acting host components using yeast two-hybrid screening.Possible involvement in plant immunity of one selectedgene, OsHRL encoding HR-like lesion inducing protein,was evaluated. Rice (O. sativa L. cv. Dongjin) seedlings were grown for6 weeks in a greenhouse under controlled temperature (20-30°C) and natural light conditions. For bacterial inocula-tions, Xoo strain was grown in Peptone Sucrose medium at28°C (Karganilla et al., 1973). The cells were collected bycentrifugation, and diluted to OD
2055210931	The DNA microarray is a powerful, high throughput technique for assessing gene expression on a system-wide genomic scale. It has great potential in pain research for determining the network of gene regulation in different pain conditions, and also for producing detailed gene expression maps in anatomical areas that process nociceptive stimuli. However, for the potential of this high throughput technology to be realised in pain research, microarrays need to be combined with other technologies. Laser capture microdissection is capable of isolating small populations of homogenous cells, allowing distinct areas involved in nociceptive processing to be examined. In combination with sophisticated PCR-based amplification protocols this technique provides sufficient amounts of messenger RNA (mRNA) for application to microarrays. Aside from the technological issues, a difficult task in any microarray study is the analysis of the resulting enormous data set to reveal the key genes, whose regulation is central to the phenotypic changes observed. For this to be achieved, the methods of data analysis, pattern searching and feature recognition, and bioinformatics have to be properly deployed all within the context of an appropriate statistical design. These issues are especially relevant to pain research where interindividual and interpopulation variation is likely to be high, and where polymorphisms can greatly affect nociceptive sensitivity and susceptibility to pain conditions. Methods for assessing the function of new candidate genes identified in microarray screening experiments are also discussed.
2055210985	Abstract Background Two siblings from consanguineous parents of Turkish descent presented with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to early death in infancy. The diagnosis of mitogenic cardiomyopathy was made histologically. Methods and results Linkage analysis combined with exome sequencing identified a homozygous deleterious mutation in the ALMS1 gene as the cause of this phenotype. Conclusions Alstrom syndrome is characterized by a typically transient dilating cardiomyopathy in infancy, suggesting that mitogenic cardiomyopathy represents the extreme phenotype, resulting in demise before the other clinical symptoms become evident. This observation further illustrates the role of ALMS1 and cell cycle regulation.
2055211034	Activation of NF-κB transcription factors by receptors of the innate or adaptive immune system is essential for host defense. However, after danger is eliminated, NF-κB signaling needs to be tightly downregulated for the maintenance of tissue homeostasis. This review highlights key negative regulatory principles that affect the amount, localization or conformational properties of NF-κB-activating proteins to attenuate the NF-κB response. These mechanisms are needed to prevent inflammation, autoimmune disease and oncogenesis.
2055211056	Summary Vacuoles were examined in cells and protoplasts of a fast growing tomato ( Lycopersicon esculentum cv. Lukullus) cell suspension culture by light and fluorescence microscopy. In protoplasts prepared from cells of the exponential growth phase a great number of small vacuoles occurred. The number of vacuoles decreased during the cell cycle until a single large vacuole was observed. Vacuoles were released from protoplasts prepared from cells of the late exponential growth phase (3.5 days) by the action of DEAE-dextran or by shaking in an alkaline buffer containing EDTA and purified by centrifugation in discontinuous sorbitol/sucrose/Fi-coll-gradients. Only slight or no contamination of the vacuolar fraction by cytosol, mitochondria, and microbodies was shown by use of marker enzymes. Vacuoles contained approximately 2.5% each of DNA and RNA. α-mannosidase was located exclusively in the vacuole and served as a convenient marker. Acid proteinase and β-N-acetylglucosaminidase were highly enriched in isolated vacuoles whereas acid phosphatase activity was low. During repeated centrifugation of isolated vacuoles about 35% were destroyed at each step. Vacuoles could be kept at 4°C for 6 hours and at 30°C for 1 hour without changing their centrifugation properties if the buffers contained 1 mM each of MgCl 2 , CaCl 2 , and 0.5% (w/v) human serum albumine.
2055211064	Photosystem I (PSI) is a multisubunit enzyme that catalyzes the light-driven oxidation of plastocyanin or cytochrome c6 and the concomitant photoreduction of ferredoxin or flavodoxin. To identify the surface-exposed domains in PSI of the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, we mapped the regions in PsaE, PsaD, and PsaF that are accessible to proteases and N-hydroxysuccinimidobiotin (NHS-biotin). Upon exposure of PSI complexes to a low concentration of endoproteinase glutamic acid (Glu)-C, PsaE was cleaved to 7.1- and 6.6-kD N-terminal fragments without significant cleavage of other subunits. Glu63 and Glu67, located near the C terminus of PsaE, were the most likely cleavage sites. At higher protease concentrations, the PsaE fragments were further cleaved and an N-terminal 9.8-kD PsaD fragment accumulated, demonstrating the accessibility of Glu residue(s) in the C-terminal domain of PsaD to the protease. Besides these major, primary cleavage products, several secondary cleavage sites on PsaD, PsaE, and PsaF were also identified. PsaF resisted proteolysis when PsaD and PsaE were intact. Glu88 and Glu124 of PsaF became susceptible to endoproteinase Glu-C upon extensive cleavage of PsaD and PsaE. Modification of PSI proteins with NHS-biotin and subsequent cleavage by endoproteinase Glu-C or thermolysin showed that the intact PsaE and PsaD, but not their major degradation products lacking C-terminal domains, were heavily biotinylated. Therefore, lysine-74 at the C terminus of PsaE was accessible for biotinylation. Similarly, lysine-107, or lysine-118, or both in PsaD could be modified by NHS-biotin.
2055211066	We present a literature survey and analysis of the profile of mites (Acari, exclusive of Ixodida) in recent literature and on the World Wide Web, and compare their prominence to that of spiders (Araneae). Despite having approximately the same number of described species, spiders outshine mites on the Web, although the study of mites (Acarology) is better represented than the study of spiders (Araneology). Broad searches of scientific literature imply that publications on mites exceed those on spiders by 2-3x; however, this dominance was reversed when a smaller number of journals with broad readerships and no taxonomic orientation (e.g., Nature, Science) were surveyed. This latter analysis revealed that the topical content of mite and spider papers in these general-science journals differs significantly. A troubling leveling-off of taxonomic publications on mites also was discovered. We conclude by suggesting some strategies that acarologists and editorial boards might follow in order to raise mites to their proper status as exemplary models for ecological and evolutionary research.
2055211191	Abstract Neanthes virens (Sars) were exposed to acute lethal and chronic sublethal concentrations of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in the laboratory. Coelomic fluid glucose and osmolality and tissue ascorbic acid and glycogen were monitored in order to assess the time-course response of this polychaete to pollutant stress. Glycemic responses and alterations in tissue ascorbic acid and glycogen levels were observed to be dose and time-dependent. During the acute lethal exposure (720 μg/I initially), a hypoglycemic response was evident during the first 8 h of exposure. At a less severe but still lethal exposure concentration (365 μg/I initially), a significant hyperglycemic response was observed after 21 h. The coelomic fluid glucose levels decreased gradually during the 4-day exposure as glycogen reserves were depleted. During the chronic (ca. 2-mth) exposure to 100 μg PCP/1. no unusual glycemic responses were observed. Glycogen reserves remained constant during the first month of exposure but were significantly depleted after 2 mth. Ascorbic acid levels became elevated in PCP-exposed worms after I wk in both parapodial tissue and posterior segments. This tendency continued throughout the exposure period and the difference between the exposed and control values was statistically significant at the termination of the experiment. An uptake and depuration experiment with14C-PCP was also conducted. Polychaetes exposed to 100 μg/l14C-PCP for 2 wk accumulated ca. 280 times the ambient exposure concentration on a wet weight basis. After 2 wk of depuration the mean PCP body burden of depurated animals had decreased by 29%.
2055211202	We used an immunosuppressed rat model to test the hypothesis that normal mechanisms regulating surfactant phosphatidylcholine synthesis and secretion in alveolar type II cells are aberrant in Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Animal groups included: group 1, healthy controls; group 2, immunosuppressed, without pneumocystosis; group 3, immunosuppressed with pneumocystosis; group 4, immunosuppressed with well-established pneumocystosis treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Type II cells were isolated from rats in each group and compared for [3H]choline incorporation into phospholipid and response of the type II cells to secretagogues. Incorporation of [3H]choline into phospholipid subclasses exhibited significant differences. Incorporation into phosphatidylcholine fell from 89.3 +/- 2.2% of total incorporation in group 1 control rats to 79.6 +/- 3.1% in group 3 rats with P. carinii pneumonia, while incorporation into sphingomyelin rose from 5.6 +/- 1.2% in group 1 animals to 15.2 +/- 2.7% in group 3 rats. Incorporation of [3H]choline into phospholipid subclasses in cells from group 2 and group 4 animals was not different from incorporation for group 1 animals. Type II cells from group 1 and group 2 (immunosuppressed control) rats responded appropriately to the secretagogues ATP, TPA, and terbutaline with a marked increase in surfactant phosphatidylcholine secretion; the effect of ATP was also blocked by the lectin, concanavalin A. In contrast, type II cells from group 3 rats failed to respond to the secretagogues with a significant increase in phospholipid secretion. Although treatment of group 4 rats with TMP-SMX markedly reduced the P. carinii organism burden, type II cells from these animals also responded poorly to the secretagogues. The depressed type II cell function described here provides a mechanism for the observed decrease in surfactant phospholipids from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of experimental animals and patients with P. carinii pneumonia. The data also suggest this defect may become irreversible with advanced disease.
2055211253	Abstract To gain new insight into the biological function of the human augmenter of liver regeneration (hALR) in HCC, we studied its involvement in radiation-induced damage and recovery of HCC cells. We found that hALR expression was up-regulated in both HCC tissues and multiple hepatoma cell lines and correlated significantly with increased radiation clonogenic survival after radiation treatment. Exogenous expression of hALR increased radiation resistance in SMMC-7721 cells, and the increased survival was accompanied by a decrease in apoptosis and a prolonged G 2 –M arrest after irradiation. Overexpression of ALR significantly increased the mitochondrial membrane potential, inhibited cytochrome c release, and opposed the loss of intracellular ATP levels after radiation. Moreover, knockdown of ALR by siRNA resulted in inhibition of viability in the absence of exogenously added oxidative stress and radiation sensitization in HepG2 cells. Importantly, hALR expression was very low in normal hepatocyte L02 cells, and hALR silencing had a minimal effect on L02 viability and radiation sensitivity. These results suggest that human ALR is important for hepatoma cell viability and involved in the protection of hepatoma cells against irradiation-induced damage by its association with mitochondria. Targeting hALR may be a promising novel approach to enhance the radiosensitivity of hepatoma cancers.
2055211356	F0F1-ATPase within chromatophore was constructed as a molecular motor biosensor through e-subunit antibody-biotin-streptavidin-biotin-AC5-Sulfo-Osu system. Based on probe-DNA specific binding, DNA of several foodborne pathogens Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella typhimurium, Vibrio parahaemolyticus and Vibrio cholerae was specifically captured by F0F1-ATPase molecular motor biosensors. Loads of DNA decreased the rotation rate of F0F1-ATPase, and led to the decrease of ATP synthesis. The detection of pathogens based on proton flux change driven by ATP-synthesis of F0F1-ATPase, which was indicated by F-DHPE, was monitored by a fluorescence spectrometer. The results demonstrate that the F0F1-ATPase molecular motor biosensor can specifically detect bacterial DNA at low concentration level, and will be a convenient, quick, and promising tool for detecting pathogens.
2055211363	Abstract Ganglioside GQ1b was found to induce terminal differentiation in normal epidermal keratinocytes (Yada et al. (1991) Biochem. J. 279, 665-670). In GQ1b-stimulated human keratinocytes, the increase in mRNA expression of Type I TGase preceded the increases in the TGase activity. The enhancement of its mRNA expression was inhibited when protein kinase C (PKC) was suppressed by pretreatment with an inhibitor, H-7, or down-regulation by long-term preincubation with phorbol dibutyrate. These results indicate that PKC is involvedin the activation of TGase probably via gene expression of TGase mRNA in GQ1b-induced human keratinocyte differentiation. Similar results were also obtained in Ca2+-induced differentiation.
2055211415	A cDNA encoding a Schistosoma japonicum aspartic proteinase was cloned, sequenced, and found to encode a zymogen of 380 amino acid residues, and its gene was shown to be present as a single copy in the S. japonicum genome. Identity comparisons showed that the enzyme (Sjpasp) was most closely related to the cathepsin Ds. The deduced amino acid sequence has four potential glycosylation sites, two of which are in identical positions to the two glycosylation sites of human kidney lysosomal cathepsin D. Furthermore, all four disulfide bonds found in mammalian cathepsin D sequences are present in Sjpasp, although the β-hairpin (loop 3), which is cleaved during maturation of vertebrate cathepsin Ds to yield light and heavy chain subunits, is absent from Sjpasp. While most residues involved in substrate specificity and catalysis of aspartic proteinases are preserved in Sjpasp, several residues in these regions exhibit changes that may result in a novel substrate specificity. Aspartic proteinase activity is present in extracts of adult S. japonicum and Schistosoma mansoni and in culture media in which schistosomes were maintained and was capable of digesting hemoglobin. The schistosome aspartic proteinase may play a pivotal role in the catabolism of hemoglobin obtained from host erythrocytes.
2055211418	Following microinjections of a colloidal gold complex into the nucleus paragigantocellularis (PGi) of the ventral medulla, and of latex microspheres into the nucleus abducens (Abd) of the same animal, retrogradely labeled neurons were identified in the region of the contralateral supraoculomotor nucleus (SOM) in the ventromedial periaqueductal gray (PAG). Neurons labeled from the Abd were found in the SOM in the ventromedial PAG throughout the midbrain, as well as scattered ventrally in the oculomotor nucleus. Neurons in the SOM area retrogradely labeled from the PGi were most numerous rostral to the dorsal raphe nucleus and extended throughout the level of the oculomotor nucleus. Direct comparison of the two labels revealed that the neurons that project to the Abd were located slightly more ventrally than PGi-projecting neurons. Almost no doubly labeled neurons were identified, although singly labeled neurons formed adjacent but separate populations. These results indicate that neurons in the SOM area projecting to the PGi are distinct from those projecting to the Abd, and that the PGi-projecting neurons are probably not pre-oculomotor neurons. Given their more dorsal location and the nature of their target neurons in the rostral ventrolateral medulla, PGi-projecting neurons may be related to visceromotor, as opposed to oculomotor functions.
2055211437	An evaluation of the geographic distribution of °60% of the 2809 described Nearctic Ichneumonidae shows that of the species whose latitudinal ranges contact a given latitudinal band, the number per million square kilometres is greatest between latitude 37.5° and 42.4°N, with °900 species/106 km2. The most severe absolute drop in species richness occurs in moving southward from the 37.5°—39.9° band to the 38.0°—37.4° band, with virtually no change in land mass over the same latitudinal change, and the smallest drop in species richness occurs in moving from the 32.5°—34.9° band to the 30.0°—32.4° band, where the land mass is almost halved. Of species whose southern range ends in a particular latitudinal band, the number per million square kilometres is greatest for 32.5°—34.4°N and drops away gradually in both directions. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that parasitic Hymenoptera do not increase in species richness with decreasing latitude to the same degree as their hosts. Various hypothes...
2055211442	In animal cells, the primary cilium transduces extracellular signals through signaling receptors localized in the ciliary membrane, but how these ciliary membrane proteins are retained in the cilium is unknown. We found that ciliary membrane proteins were highly mobile, but their diffusion was impeded at the base of the cilium by a diffusion barrier. Septin 2 (SEPT2), a member of the septin family of guanosine triphosphatases that form a diffusion barrier in budding yeast, localized at the base of the ciliary membrane. SEPT2 depletion resulted in loss of ciliary membrane protein localization and Sonic hedgehog signal transduction, and inhibited ciliogenesis. Thus, SEPT2 is part of a diffusion barrier at the base of the ciliary membrane and is essential for retaining receptor-signaling pathways in the primary cilium.
2055211517	Airway inflammation in bacterial infections is characterized by the presence of neutrophils and often epithelial injury and repair. Release of endotoxin from bacteria may contribute to these processes. The purpose of this study was to determine the in vivo effects of repeated endotoxin exposure on DNA synthesis in rat nasal epithelium in the presence and absence of neutrophilic influx. Rats were intranasally instilled, once a day for 3 days, with endotoxin or saline (controls). Before the first and third instillations, half of the saline and endotoxin-instilled animals were depleted of circulating blood neutrophils by administering a rabbit anti-rat neutrophil antiserum. Rats were sacrificed 6 or 24 h after the last instillation. Two hours prior to sacrifice, rats were intraperitoneally injected with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU), an analog of thymidine that is incorporated in the nucleus of cells in the S-phase of the cell cycle. Nasal tissues were processed for light microscopy and immunohistochemical detection of BrdU in nasal epithelial cells. The numbers of nasal epithelial cells, BrdU-labeled epithelial nuclei, and neutrophils per millimeter of basal lamina in the epithelium lining the nasal turbinates in the proximal nasal passages were determined by morphometric analysis. The authors did not observe a neutrophilic influx inmore » the nasal tissues of neutrophil-depleted rats at 6 or 24 h after the last endotoxin instillation; however, the numbers of nasal epithelial cells and the BrdU-labeling index were significantly increased compared to saline-instilled controls. In contrast, non-neutrophil-depleted rats instilled with endotoxin had a marked neutrophilic influx, but no significant differences in the number of nasal epithelial cells at 6 or 24 h, compared to controls. In addition, the BrdU-labeling index in neutrophil-sufficient rats was increased only 6 h after the last instillation, compared to controls.« less
2055211543	The latest works on iniopterygians question their monophyly when considering only the neurocranium of the two families (Sibyrhynchidae and Iniopterygidae), which have different conditions of preservation. Some of the synapomorphies of the Iniopterygia concern the pectoral girdle and fins. However, the anatomy of these different elements is still poorly known in this taxon. Here we describe in details three dimensionally preserved cartilages of the pectoral girdle and fins of the sibyrhynchid Iniopera sp. These structures have been extracted virtually from phosphatised nodules thanks to conventional and synchrotron microtomography, using absorption and phase contrast based techniques in the later case. The pectoral girdle of Iniopera sp. consists of three elements, which are, from dorsal to ventral, a paired suprascapular cartilage, a pair of robust scapulocoracoids and an unpaired intercoracoid cartilage. The scapular part of the scapulocoracoids is extremely reduced and the suprascapular cartilages link the scapulcoracoids to the rear of the neurocranium. These characters may be iniopterygian synapomorphies. Iniopterygians, stem and crown-holocephalans share a basipterygium that articulates with the pectoral girdle and bears an enlarged first pectoral fin radial. Posteriorly, the basipterygium articulates with either a well-defined metapterygium (in crown-holocephalans) or a metapterygial axis (in stem-holocephalans).
2055211600	Cytoplasmic and nuclear hypertrophy in neurons from the last 3 pairs of sensory ganglia left in situ cranially to the plane of amputation occurs during lizard tail regeneration. Cytophotometry after Feulgen staining demonstrated the presence of some neurons, from hypertrophic ganglia, whose quantity of DNA exceeded the diploid level (hyperdiploid neurons). In the present work agarose gel electrophoresis of total genomic DNA extracted from hypertrophic ganglia showed one or two bands migrating below the high molecular weight DNA, pointing to a selective amplification of discrete DNA segments.
2055211638	Pubertal development in teleost fish is characterized by gonadal growth that is directly stimulated by the pituitary gonadotropins, FSH and LH. We used a quantitative ribonuclease protection assay to provide, for the first time, the developmental profiles of the alpha-, betaFSH-, and betaLH-subunit gene expression in a seasonal breeding fish, the female striped bass (3-yr study, n = 207). Two-year-old females were sexually immature, although a transient rise in all gonadotropin subunit mRNAs was measured in the pituitary. Pubertal ovarian development occurred in 65% of 3-yr-old females, characterized by the appearance of lipid droplets within the oocytes. This reproductive phase, termed pubertal development, was associated with a 34-fold increase in the mRNA levels of betaFSH and a rise in the pituitary concentration of LH. The first sexual maturation took place in 4-yr-old females and coincided with a 218-fold increase in the mRNA levels of betaFSH. During this time period, the mRNA levels of the alpha and betaLH subunits increased by 11- and 8-fold, respectively. At the final stages of vitellogenic growth, mRNA levels of betaFSH declined to basal levels, whereas the mRNA levels of the alpha and betaLH subunits remained elevated. Throughout the study, pituitary LH concentration was positively correlated to the mRNA levels of betaLH, but plasma levels of LH remained low and unchanged (0.4-0.8 ng/ml) despite increasing levels of pituitary LH concentration, suggesting a regulated secretion pathway. Taken together, the data show that the profiles of betaFSH and betaLH mRNAs appear to follow an annual rhythm that is associated with developmental events in the growing oocytes. In particular, increasing levels of betaFSH mRNA appear to underlie the first sexual maturity in the female striped bass.
2055211644	Abstract Malate dehydrogenase has been detected in four species of the super-species Jaera albifrons. Two polymorphic enzymatic systems occur showing a one banded pattern for homozygotes and a three banded pattern for heterozygotes. Two independant autosomal loci control the variation as is shown by intra- and interspecific crosses. In European populations of the three species studied, MDH-1 is polymorphic and MDH-2 is monomorphic. In the American species, J. posthirsuta, the locus MDH-2 is polymorphic and MDH-1 is monomorphic.
2055211669	Abstract The toxicity of several organic insecticides to coho (Oncorhynchus kisutch) and chinook salmon (O. tshawytscha), rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri), and the threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) was determined. Toxaphene, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, lindane, methoxychlor, heptachlor, chlordane, endrin, Guthion, malathion, Co-Ral, and Sevin were tested. Toxicity was determined at 20° C. in standing water bioassays which lasted 96 hours. Endrin was the most toxic substance tested; the 96-hour median tolerance limit (TLm) for coho salmon was 0.51 parts per billion. With the exception of Co-Ral and Sevin, the 96-hour TLm values of all insecticides tested were near 100 parts per billion (0.1 p.p.m.), or much less. The toxicity of the insecticides to threespine sticklebacks in waters of 5 and 25 parts per thousand salinity was not markedly different at the two salinities.
2055211670	In photosynthetic eukaryotes, nonphotochemical plastoquinone (PQ) reduction is important for the regulation of photosynthetic electron flow. In green microalgae where this process has been demonstrated, the chloroplastic enzyme that catalyses nonphotochemical PQ reduction has not been identified yet. Here, we show by an RNA interference (RNAi) approach that the NDA2 gene, belonging to a type II NAD(P)H dehydrogenases family in the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, encodes a chloroplastic dehydrogenase that functions to reduce PQ nonphotochemically in this alga. Using a specific antibody, we show that the Nda2 protein is localized in chloroplasts of wild-type cells and is absent in two Nda2-RNAi cell lines. In both mutant cell lines, nonphotochemical PQ reduction is severely affected, as indicated by altered chlorophyll fluorescence transients after saturating illumination. Compared with wild type, change in light excitation distribution between photosystems ('state transition') upon inhibition of mitochondrial electron transport is strongly impaired in transformed cells because of inefficient PQ reduction. Furthermore, the amount of hydrogen produced by Nda2-RNAi cells under sulfur deprivation is substantially decreased compared with wild type, which supports previous assumptions that endogenous substrates serve as source of electrons for hydrogen formation. These results demonstrate the importance of Nda2 for nonphotochemical PQ reduction and associated processes in C. reinhardtii.
2055211686	The sensory and motor connections of the cervical vagus nerves and of its inferior ganglion (nodose ganglion) have been traced in the medulla and upper cervical spinal cord of 16 male Wistar rats by using horseradish peroxidase (HRP) neurohistochemistry. The use of tetramethyl benzidine (TMB) as the substrate for HRP permitted the visualization of transganglionic and retrograde transport in sensory nerve terminals and perikarya, respectively. The vagus nerve in the rat enters the medulla in numerous fascicles with points of entry covering the entire lateral aspect of the medulla extending from level +4 to - 6 mm rostrocaudal to the obex. Fascicles of vagal sensory fibers enter the dorsolateral aspect of the medulla and travel to the tractus solitarius (TS) which was labeled for over 8.8 mm in the medulla. The caudal extent of the TS receiving vagal projections was found in lamina V of the cervical spinal cord (C1 to C2). Sensory terminal fields could be visualized bilaterally in the nucleus of the tractus solitarius (nTS), area postrema (ap) and dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus nerve (dmnX). The ipsilateral projection to the nTS and the dmnX was heavier than that found on the contralateral side. The area postrema was intensely labeled on both sides. Motor fibers from HRP-labeled perikarya in the dmnX travel ventromedially in a distinct fascicle and subsequently subdivide into a number of small fiber bundles that traverse the medullary reticular formation in the form of a fine network of HRP-labeled fibers. As these fibers from the dmnX approach the ventrolateral aspect of the medulla they are joined by axons from the nucleus ambiguus (nA), nucleus retroambigualis (nRA) and the retro facial nucleus (nRF). These latter fibers form hairpin loops in the middle of the reticular formation to accompany the axons from the dmnX exiting from the medulla in a ventrolateral location. HRP-labeled perikarya, in contrast to transganglionically transported HRP in sensory terminals in the nTS, were visualized on one side only, thus indicating that motor control via the vagus nerve is exerted only by motor neurons located ipsilaterally. Sensory information on the other hand, diverges to many nuclear subgroups located on both sides of the medulla.
2055211809	This study was concerned with the handling of ingested tubercle bacilli by normal human macrophages. Intracellular growth was determined after exposure of macrophages to viable bacilli in vitro and the effect of various cytokines, alone or in combination, on bacilli growth/survival was determined. It was found that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) grew quite readily in untreated cultured human macrophages. Treatment with soluble factors showed that a crude lymphokine containing supernatant elicited with Concanavalin A (Con A) was ineffective at reducing growth of M.tb in vitro; similarly a crude lymphokine preparation from M.tb lysate-stimulated mononuclear cells failed to induce any mycobacteriostatic activity in human monocyte-derived macrophages. Recombinant cytokines were then evaluated for their ability to modulate growth of the tubercle bacilli in human macrophages. Recombinant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-2 (IL-2) and recombinant interleukin 4 (IL-4) were all ineffective at modifying M. tuberculosis growth in human macrophages. Recombinant tumour necrosis-alpha (TNF-alpha) curbed the growth of the bacilli in human macrophages in a reproducible fashion. No cytokine combination was more efficient than TNF-alpha alone. These studies thus highlight the resistance of virulent mycobacteria against different mechanisms of cytokine-induced macrophage bactericidal activity.
2055211811	Seabirds show a range of patterns of sexual size dimorphism and sex-specific parental investment, but the underlying causes remain poorly understood. The aim of the present study was to test two longstanding hypotheses of parental investment in a sexually monomorphic species, Wilson’s storm petrel Oceanites oceanicus, namely that males attend chicks more frequently and females deliver larger meals (Beck and Brown in Br Antarct Surv Sci Rep 69:1–54, 1972). We recorded in eight seasons, both during incubation and chick rearing, which adult was caught first in a nest and found no difference in the probability of catching a male or a female first in any year. Additionally, in five seasons we employed a miniature video camera to record nest attendance during chick rearing and found no significant difference except for 2006, a year with very low krill availability, where females visited the nest less often than males. We then combined video observations with periodic weighing of chicks to estimate mean daily feeding mass (g/day) of males and females and found no difference in the amount of food delivered per day between the sexes. However, in years with low krill availability, males and females tended to use different strategies to achieve the same feeding rates, with females undertaking longer foraging trips and delivering heavier meals. Thus, our results do not support the hypothesis of a general sex-specific parental investment in Wilson’s storm petrels, but a tendency for a context-dependent sex-specific investment in the years of food shortage.
2055211838	Galectins are a family of carbohydrate binding proteins with a broad range of cytokine and growth factor-like functions in multiple steps of cancer progression. They contribute to tumor cell transformation, promote tumor angiogenesis, hamper the anti-tumor immune response, and facilitate tumor metastasis. Consequently, galectins are considered as multifunctional targets for cancer therapy. Interestingly, many of the functions related to tumor progression can be linked to galectins expressed by endothelial cells in the tumor vascular bed. Since the tumor vasculature is an easily accessible target for cancer therapy, understanding how galectins in the tumor endothelium influence cancer progression is important for the translational development of galectin-targeting therapies.
2055211854	A new DNA reporter construct has been designed for protein quantification by immuno-PCR. It has been shown that the amplification efficiency of a reporter that contains a fragment of human adenovirus 2 flanked by homoprimer sequences is much higher than standard PCR format based on two different primers. The further application of the new construct and its homoprimer-based detection could represent new ways to increase the sensitivity of the immuno-PCR and the efficiency of single-molecule PCR.
2055211895	Background. Antrodia cinnamomea is an edible fungus commonly used in Asia as a well-known medicinal herb capable of treating drug intoxication and liver cancer. Methods. This study evaluated the anticancer activity of its biotechnological product, mycelial fermentation broth (AC-MFB) on hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) by tetrazolium-based colorimetric assay in vitro and syngeneic Balb/c 1MEA.7R.1 tumor implantation model in vivo. Given that cancer stem cell characteristics, such as angiogenesis, invasiveness, and migration, are known to cause recurrence, we further evaluated the effect of AC-MFB on cellular viability inhibition of HCC cells, angiogenic activity and migration of endothelial cells, and the release of proangiogenic factors from HCC cells. Results. We found that AC-MFB markedly inhibited the growth of HCC without hepatic enzyme abnormality. This anti-HCC activity was validated by growth-inhibitory effects on both cultured murine 1MEA.7R.1 and human HA22T/VGH HCC cells. For cancer stem cell characteristics, AC-MFB inhibited the cellular viability, migration, and tube formation activity of EA. hy926 and SVEC4-10 endothelial cells. Production of extracellular vascular endothelial growth factor and intracellular hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha from HCC cells was suppressed by AC-MFB. Conclusion. Antrodia cinnamomea could inhibit the growth and cancer stem cell characteristics of HCC cells.

2055212149	Fungal infections and leishmaniasis are an important cause of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised patients. The macrolide polyene antibiotic amphotericin B (AmB) has long been recognized as a powerful fungicidal and leishmanicidal drug. A conventional intravenous dosage form of AmB, AmB- deoxycholate (Fungizone or D-AmB), is the most effective clinically available for treating fungal and parasitic (leishmaniasis) infections. However, the clinical efficacy of AmB is limited by its adverse effects mainly nephrotoxicity. Efforts to lower the toxicity are based on synthesis of AmB analogues such as AmB esters or preparation of AmB-lipid associations in the forms of liposomal AmB (L-AmB or AmBisome), AmB lipid complex (Abelcet or ABLC), AmB colloidal dispersion (Amphocil or ABCD), and intralipid AmB. These newer formulations are substantially more expensive, but allow patients to receive higher doses for longer periods of time with decreased renal toxicity than conventional AmB. Modifications of liposomal surface in order to avoid RES uptake, thus increased targetability has been attempted. Emulsomes and other nanoparticles are special carrier systems for intracellular localization in macrophage rich organs like liver and spleen. Injectable nano-carriers have important potential applications as in site-specific drug delivery.
2055212209	Transduction in the semicircular canal was studied by focusing an infrared beam on either side of exposed ampullae from the posterior canals of Rana pipiens . The direction of fluid movement resulting from a stimulus was inferred by observing the polarity of the change in afferent impulse mean rate relative to the spontaneous value. On the basis of the accepted functional polarization of this receptor, the results indicate that fluid moved toward the warmer side of the ampulla. Convection and thermal reception were shown to be unlikely explanations for these results. Morover, cupular displacements toward the warmer side would not be expected. Because thermo-osmosis can cause fluid to move toward the warmer side in a gelatin membrane, the results can be interpreted as evidence that thermo-osmosis occurred in the gelatinous cupula and influenced the transduction mechanism. Thermo-osmosis of liquids appears to be due to an electric field that is set up in a charged membrane; hence, the hair cells might have detected an electric field that occurred in the cupula during thermo-osmosis. Electroreception might be an important link in the transduction of physiological stimuli also. Rotational stimuli could result in weak electric fields in the cupula by the mechanoelectric effect. Cupular displacements could be important for large stimuli, but extrapolations to threshold stimuli suggest displacements of angstrom amplitudes. Therefore, electroreception by the hair cells could be an explanation of the great sensitivity that has been observed in the semicircular canal and other labyrinthine receptors.
2055212269	A GA deficiency mutant was previously described in a single population ofSolanum tuberosum ssp.andigena (adg). A representative sample of 120 adg populations in the US Potato Genebank was screened for the dwarfing mutant. Up to 500 seedlings of each adg population were evaluated. Dwarfs were detected in 14 populations from a minimum of 0.2% to a maximum of 27.7%, indicating that the allele is not particularly rare or at risk of loss from the Genebank.
2055212290	Binding of human plasminogen to Streptococcus pneumoniae and its subsequent activation promotes penetration of bacteria through reconstituted basement membranes. In this study, we have characterized a novel pneumococcal surface protein with a molecular mass of 47 kDa, designated Eno, which specifically binds human plasmin(ogen), exhibits alpha-enolase activity and is necessary for viability. Using enzyme assays, we have confirmed the alpha-enolase activity of both pneumococcal surface-displayed Eno and purified recombinant Eno protein. Immunoelectron microscopy indicated the presence of Eno in the cytoplasm as well as on the surface of encapsulated and unencapsulated pneumococci. Plasminogen-binding activity was demonstrated with whole pneumococcal cells and purified Eno protein. Binding of activated plasminogen was also shown for Eno; however, the affinity for plasmin is significantly reduced compared with plasminogen. Results from competitive inhibition assays indicate that binding is mediated through the lysine binding sites in plasmin(ogen). Carboxypeptidase B treatment and amino acid substitutions of the C-terminal lysyl residues of Eno indicated that the C-terminal lysine is pivotal for plasmin(ogen)-binding activity. Eno is ubiquitously distributed among pneumococcal serotypes, and binding experiments suggested the reassociation of secreted Eno to the bacterial cell surface. The reassociation was also confirmed by immunoelectron microscopy. The results suggest a mechanism of plasminogen activation for human pathogens that might contribute to their virulence potential in invasive infectious processes.
2055212312	The tumor-inhibitory antibiotic, raromycin is produced by a soil strepmyces which differs from any previously described members of the genus. We therefore regard it as representing a new species for which the name S. albochromogenes is assigned. Morphological, physiological and serological characteristics of the cultures of this organism is described in detail. It is closely related to S. griseochromogenes.
2055212332	One important target of boron (B) deficiency and aluminum (Al) toxicity is cell wall. Thus we studied the hypothesis that B is capable of alleviating Al toxicity in pea (Pisum sativum). Short-term and prolonged Al exposure to pea roots at different B levels was carried out on uniform seedlings pre-cultured at a low B level. When seedlings with a low B level were supplied with or without B for 1 and 2 days before 24 h Al exposure, roots were longer while root diameter was thinner after B addition especially for 2 days even with exposure to Al; root elongation was inhibited while root diameter was enlarged by Al exposure. Callose induction by Al toxicity was higher with B added, but this was reversed after the removal of the cotyledons. Hematoxylin staining was lighter in the root tips given B, and Al content in the root tips and cell walls dropped after exposure to B. This indicates that B alleviated Al toxicity in the root tips during short-term Al exposure by decreasing Al binding in root cell walls. An increase in chlorophyll and biomass and reduced chlorosis were found at the higher level of B during prolonged Al treatment, which was coincided with the decreased Al contents, indicating that B alleviated Al toxicity to shoots. B supplementation alleviates some of the consequences of Al toxicity by limiting some Al binding in cell walls, resulting in less injury to the roots as well as less injury to the shoots.
2055212357	The effect of EGF stimulation and its inhibition with gefitinib ('Iressa', ZD1839), an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been investigated in two EGFR-positive human bladder tumour cell lines, RT112 and RT4. The growth of RT112 cells in a medium containing 10% foetal bovine serum was inhibited by 50% with 10 microM gefitinib, whereas this dose completely inhibited RT4 cell growth. Cells were more sensitive to growth inhibition in the serum-free medium. Increased growth of cells in the serum-free medium was observed with 10 or 50 ng x ml(-1) EGF and the proliferative effect of EGF stimulation in both cell lines was inhibited in the presence of 1 microM, but not 0.1 microM gefitinib. Zymography of the conditioned medium from RT112 cells treated with EGF and gefitinib showed a decrease in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) concentrations. Western blot analysis showed that tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1(TIMP1) increased in the conditioned medium from RT112 cells treated with EGF, and this was partially inhibited with both 1 and 5 microM gefitinib. Conversely, TIMP2 decreased with EGF stimulation and this was reversed with gefitinib. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 1 had no effect on the growth of either cell line. These studies show alterations in the balance of MMPs and their inhibitors in EGF-stimulated bladder tumour cells, which are reversed by gefitinib, suggesting gefitinib should be investigated for its effect on human bladder tumours.
2055212405	Fusion of vesicles with the plasma membrane generates omega-shaped intermediates that are thought to either dilate until flat or less frequently, undergo pore closure. Chiang et al. reveal that in chromaffin cells, these structures do not dilate, but change in size before pore closure or shrink until undetectable.

2055212432	Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) allows rapid amplification of nucleic acids under isothermal conditions. In this report, a 20-min LAMP amplification of the DPOL gene of infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV) using a biotin-labeled primer was combined with lateral flow dipstick (LFD) chromatography for rapid and simple visual detection of ISKNV-specific amplicons. The LFD process involves a 5-min specific hybridization with an FITC-labeled DNA probe to confirm the presence of complement ISKNV amplicons that were biotinated in LAMP. The resulting DNA duplexes, consisting of labeled probes and amplicons, migrate along the LFD strip by chromatography for 5 min and are trapped at the test line and visualized by biotin labeling. The detection limit of ISKNV by LAMP-LFD was 10 copies. The results show that the LAMP-LFD method has the advantages of better sensitivity and speed and less dependence on equipment than the standard PCR for specifically detecting low levels of ISKNV DNA, and this can be useful in the field as a routine diagnostic tool.
2055212449	Disruption of the two thioredoxin genes in yeast dramatically affects cell viability and growth. Expression ofArabidopsis thioredoxin AtTRX3 in theSaccharomyces thioredoxin Δ strain EMY63 restores a wild-type cell cycle, the ability to grow on methionine sulfoxide, and H2O2 tolerance. In order to isolate thioredoxin targets related to these phenotypes, we prepared a C35S (Escherichia coli numbering) thioredoxin mutant to stabilize the intermediate disulfide bridged complex and we added a polyhistidine N-terminal extension in order to purify the complex rapidly. Expression of this mutant thioredoxin in the wild-type yeast induces a reduced tolerance to H2O2, but only limited change in the cell cycle and no change in methionine sulfoxide utilization. Expression in the Δ thioredoxin strain EMY63 allowed us to isolate a complex of the thioredoxin with YLR109, an abundant yeast protein related to PMP20, a peroxisomal protein of Candida. No function has so far been attributed to this protein or to the other numerous homologues described in plants, animals, fungi, and prokaryotes. On the basis of the complementation and of low similarity with peroxiredoxins, we produced YLR109 and one of itsArabidopsis homologues in E. coli to test their peroxiredoxins activity. We demonstrate that both recombinant proteins present a thioredoxin-dependent peroxidase activityin vitro. The possible functions of this new peroxiredoxin family are discussed.
2055212451	The X Chromosome (Chr) genes for phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetases 1 and 2, Prps1 and Prps2, were mapped on the mouse X Chr with interspecific backcrosses between C57BL/6 (B6) and M. spretus (S). Southern analysis showed that Prps1 mapped between Plp and DXWas31, a mouse X Chr region that is homologous to Xq21-24 on the human X Chr while Prps2 mapped between DXWas31 and Amg, a region that is homologous to the map position of PRPS2 on Xp22 of the human X Chr. Additionally, other restriction fragments highlighted by PRS II showed autosomal segregation. In situ hybridization and FISH analysis of metaphase chromosome spreads prepared from lymphocytes of B6 or S male mice confirmed that there were in fact two different locations on the X Chr, X F1-2 and X F2-3 for Prps1 and 2 respectively, as well as two autosomal sites for Prps-like genes.
2055212490	Abstract The common association of malnutrition and infection has led to many studies that have examined the effects of nutritional status on immunocompetence. Children with the syndromes of marasmus and kwaskiorkor show marked impairment of cell-mediated immunity (CMI), complement system, microbicidal function of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), and secretory IgA antibody response. The extensive literature on this burgeoning field has been summarized 1–5,40 Clinical malnutrition, however, is a complex combination of the deficiencies of many nutrients, including proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, macrominerals and trace elements. Thus it is of fundamental importance to examine the influence of individual dietary factors on immune responses and disease (Fig. 1). Here Ranjit Chandra discusses the role of trace elements in host resistance to infection and other pathological diseases.
2055212652	Background. The somatostatin analogue octreotide impairs intestinal regeneration and the adaptive response to intestinal resection by inhibition of enterocyte migration and proliferation and increased apoptosis. Epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates regeneration and adaptation by increasing proliferation and reducing apoptosis. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of EGF on octreotide-induced enterocyte apoptosis. Methods. Twenty-four rabbits underwent patch enteroplasty in the distal ileum to stimulate the mucosa. There were four study groups: octreotide 250 μg/kg/ day, EGF 40 μg/kg/day, EGF plus octreotide, and control. Normal ileal mucosa adjacent to the patch was evaluated at 7 days for villus height, crypt depth, crypt cell production rate (CCPR), and in situ end labeling of DNA fragmentation. Results. Octreotide alone increased apoptosis compared with controls at the villus tip (40 ± 7% vs 18 ± 7%, P < 0.05), lateral villus (9 ± 2% vs 3 ± 2%, P < 0.05), and crypt (15 ± 3% vs 10 ± 3%, P < 0.05). EGF decreased apoptosis in the crypt (2 ± 1%) and villus (6 ± 1% villus tip and 1 ± 1% lateral villus, P < 0.05) compartments. EGF inhibited octreotide-induced apoptosis in the crypt (5 ± 2%) but not the villus (31 ± 5% villus tip and 6 ± 2% lateral villus, P < 0.05). Mean DNA fragmentation was significantly greater in octreotide-treated animals (P < 0.05). The octreotide-treated animals had reduced crypt depth and villus height but normal CCPR compared with controls. EGF increased CCPR and crypt depth compared with controls. Combining EGF and octreotide resulted in crypt depth and CCPR similar to those of controls but reduced villus height. Conclusions. EGF inhibits octreotide-induced apoptosis. This effect is greater in crypt than in villus enterocytes. Octreotide appears to have both direct and indirect effects on enterocyte apoptosis.
2055212693	The investigation concerned the mycoflora of the old, in some cases already discarded, bath houses (‘sauna’) situated in various parts of Finland for the purpose of finding the fungus,Phialophora pedrosoi, which causes chromoblastomycosis in man. The material, 220 specimens, consisting of thin shavings from the wooden floors and platforms, was collected from 78 bath houses. P. pedrosoi was not found in this investigation; the followingPhialophora-species:P. fastigiata, P. lagerbergii, P. lignicola andP. verrucosa were isolated, however. In total 98 various fungus species were isolated, the number of isolates was 1052. Phycomycetes represented 9.2 % of the species and 15.2 % of the isolates, Ascomycetes 4.1 % and 3.4 %, Basidiomycetes 4.1 % and 0.7 % and Fungi imperfecti 82.6 % and 80.7 % respectively of the species and the isolates. The species most frequently isolated from specimens were:Trichoderma viride, Mucor mucedo, Stemphylium consortiale, Rhinocladiella atrovirens, Arthrobotrys superba andPhialophora verrucosa. In all, 13 nematode-destroying fungus species were isolated belonging to the genera:Nematoctonus, Cephalosporium, Harposporium, Dactylaria, Arthrobotrys andDactylella. 60 % of the bath houses were infected by nematodes. Gliodendron gen. nov. with the speciesGliodendron balnicolum sp. nov. is described and illustrated.
2055212791	Abstract Previously reported changes in the deoxyribonucleoprotein (DNP) complex of human leucocytes responding to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) were further investigated in the present work by using the alkaline bromphenol blue (BPB) binding reaction for basic proteins. The extraction of DNA preceding the BPB-binding was performed both in trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and in picric acid (PA). TCA liberates both arginine and lysine residues for the subsequent BPB-binding. PA, which was found to bind strongly to the guanidino-groups of arginine, mainly liberates the lysine residues for the following BPB-binding. By measuring the amounts of PA and BPB bound after PA-hydrolysis and BPB staining, information was obtained about the relative amounts of arginine and lysine in histone bound to DNA. In PHA-treated cells a 25% decrease in BPB-binding was observed after TCA-hydrolysis. No such decrease in BPB-binding could be demonstrated after PA-hydrolysis. However, as much as an 80% decrease was found in the PA-binding capacity. These results were interpreted as a reduced number of arginine residues in histone bound to the DNA-phosphate groups in cells exposed to PHA.
2055212835	During a 1-year-study in tropical Panama, prey of the social theridiid Anelosimus eximius was analysed at two locations and compared with the potential prey spectrum according to sweepnet catches, pitfall traps and bowl traps. Compared with other web-building spiders, A. eximius catch an unusually high number of large insects: about 90% are flying ants, beetles,lepidopterans hemipterans, cockroaches and grasshoppers. This is the result of a communal strategy to overwhelm prey. Webs are maintained commonly, and several spiders attack an entangled insect simultaneously. More spiders participate on insects that are larger and struggle more. The ability to catch large prey insects is discussed as a major driving factor for sociality in spiders.
2055212849	High nitrate concentration is a problem when lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) is grown under low light intensities. Genotypes with low nitrate concentrations have been identified and are being used in breeding programmes. Previous results indicated the occurrence of genotype × environment (GE) interactions. Because of the important influence of light intensity on nitrate accumulation, two types of interactions may be expected: interactions related to daily variation, and those related to annual variation. In the present investigation both types were investigated using eight butterhead genotypes of lettuce which were repeatedly harvested. No daily variation in nitrate concentration and no corresponding GE-interactions were found, irrespective of the level of global radiation. In contrast, a large annual variation and important corresponding GE-interactions were found. Joint regression analysis on environmental means and on physical factors related to light intensity showed a differential response of genotypes to changing environmental conditions. Multiple joint regression on daylength and change in daylength accounted for two-thirds of the interaction variance. However, deviations from regression were still significant indicating non-linearity of the relationship, or, the existence of other environmental factors contributing to GE-interaction.
2055212886	Measurements of basal metabolic rate (BMR) and physique were made on Gurkha soldiers stationed in Britain, and on British controls matched by body weight and occupational background. Gurkhas were significantly shorter, with greater body mass index, calf circumference and subscapular skinfold thickness than the European controls, although there was no difference in BMR between the two groups. For the Gurkhas, linear regression analysis incorporating factors which may influence BMR showed a positive relationship between the length of time since leaving Nepal and BMR, supporting the view that Asians living in temperate regions have higher BMR than those living in the tropics.
2055212900	Diverse stressors impede female receptivity and fertility. Since epinephrine is released from the adrenal during stress, it might play a role in stress-induced disruptions of female reproductive parameters. Experiment 1 examined whether exogenous epinephrine would disrupt lordosis behavior in estrogen- and progesterone-treated ovariectomized female mice. Single dosages of 20 and 40 micrograms almost eliminated sexual receptivity. Experiments 2 and 3 examined whether chronic dosages of epinephrine shortly after insemination would lead to a failure of implantation of mouse embryos. Results indicated that epinephrine had little effect on the number of dams delivering pups, the number of pups born, litter weight, or the number of stillbirths.
2055212901	The protein PgChP is a new chitosanase produced by Penicillium chrysogenum AS51D that showed antifungal activity against toxigenic molds. Two isoforms were found by SDS-PAGE in the purified extract of PgChP. After enzymatic deglycosylation, only the smaller isoform was observed by SDS-PAGE. Identical amino acid sequences were obtained from the two isoforms. Analysis of the molecular mass by electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry revealed six major peaks from 30 to 31 kDa that are related to different levels of glycosylation. The pgchp gene has 1,146 bp including four introns and an open reading frame encoding a protein of 304 amino acids. The translated open reading frame has a predicted mass of 32 kDa, with the first 21 amino acids comprising a signal peptide. Two N glycosylation consensus sequences are present in the protein sequence. The deduced sequence showed high identity with fungal chitosanases. A high level of catalytic activity on chitosan was observed. PgChP is the first chitosanase described from P. chrysogenum. Given that enzymes produced by this mold species are granted generally recognized as safe status, PgChP could be used as a food preservative against toxigenic molds and to obtain chitosan oligomers for food additives and nutraceuticals.
2055212905	Abstract Objective: To analyse in situ the placental expression of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), its receptors TNFRp55 and TNFRp75, and apoptosis in normotensive and preeclamptic pregnancies. Design and methods: We simultaneously analyzed the immunostaining of TNF-α, its receptors and apoptosis in term placentas of 15 patients with preeclampsia and 15 normotensive pregnant women as controls. Results: In normotensive villi TNF-α and TNFRp75 were expressed more in syncytiotrophoblasts than cytotrophoblasts or stromal cells, and were almost absent in endothelial cells. TNFRp55 was expressed uniformly in all types of placental cells. Apoptosis was more marked in syncytiotrophoblasts than cytotrophoblasts. In preeclamptic trophoblasts apoptosis was exaggerated whereas expression of TNF-α and its receptors remained unchanged. Conclusions: Placental expression of TNF-α and TNFRp75 appear inter-adaptative and follow the same pattern, whereas TNFRp55 and TNF-α appear independent. In addition, the exaggerated apoptosis of preeclamptic trophoblasts may be dependent on factors other than the TNF-α system alone.
2055212910	N23 and N24, selected from hundreds of ad-3 mutants, have been used as testers for the spot, plate and suspension tests in Neurospora crassa. These two testers are highly sensitive to mutagens and are revertible by a specific group of chemicals. N23 can be reverted from an adenine-dependence to adenine-independence by agents which cause base-pair substitutions whereas N24 can be reverted by frameshift mutagens. Studies described here show that spot, plate and suspension tests using testers N23 and N24 are satisfactory substitutes for the ad-3 forward-mutation system for screening the mutagenic activity of environmental agents and chemical carcinogens in N. crassa.
2055212957	The brain-specific compound NAA (N-acetylaspartate) occurs almost exclusively in neurons, where its concentration reaches approx. 20 mM. Its abundance is determined in patients by MRS (magnetic resonance spectroscopy) to assess neuronal density and health. The molecular identity of the NAT (N-acetyltransferase) that catalyses NAA synthesis has remained unknown, because the enzyme is membrane-bound and difficult to purify. Database searches indicated that among putative NATs (i.e. proteins homologous with known NATs, but with uncharacterized catalytic activity) encoded by the human and mouse genomes two were almost exclusively expressed in brain, NAT8L and NAT14. Transfection studies in HEK-293T [human embryonic kidney-293 cells expressing the large T-antigen of SV40 (simian virus 40)] indicated that NAT8L, but not NAT14, catalysed the synthesis of NAA from L-aspartate and acetyl-CoA. The specificity of NAT8L, its Km for aspartate and its sensitivity to detergents are similar to those described for brain Asp-NAT. Confocal microscopy analysis of CHO (Chinese-hamster ovary) cells and neurons expressing recombinant NAT8L indicates that it is associated with the ER (endoplasmic reticulum), but not with mitochondria. A mutation search in the NAT8L gene of the only patient known to be deficient in NAA disclosed the presence of a homozygous 19 bp deletion, resulting in a change in reading frame and the absence of production of a functional protein. We conclude that NAT8L, a neuron-specific protein, is responsible for NAA synthesis and is mutated in primary NAA deficiency (hypoacetylaspartia). The molecular identification of this enzyme will lead to new perspectives in the clarification of the function of this most abundant amino acid derivative in neurons and for the diagnosis of hypoacetylaspartia in other patients.
2055212980	Abstract The ingestion of Bacillus thuringiensis crystal endotoxin by Manduca sexta causes the destruction of both goblet and columnar cells of the midgut. One hour after ingestion, the microvilli show pathological effects. Nearly complete destruction of the goblet and columnar cells has taken place after 4 hr exposure to the toxin.
2055213011	Treatment of stem sections of peach (Prunus persica (L.) Batsch) and flowering dogwood (Cornus florida L.) with macerase, an enzyme mixture rich in pectinase, for 24–48 h resulted in a complete flattening of the low-temperature exotherm (LTE) as determined by differential thermal analysis (DTA). Ultrastructural analysis of macerase-treated tissue demonstrated a nearly complete digestion of the pit membrane (black cap and primary cell-wall) of nearly 100% of the xylem-parenchyma cells examined after 48 h of exposure to the enzyme. Additionally, the underlying amorphous layer was partially degraded in up to 57% of the cells examined. The macerase treatment had no visible effect on secondary cell-walls of xylem tissue. In contrast, treatment of stem tissue with cellulysin (mostly cellulase) resulted in a shift of the LTE to warmer temperatures as determined by DTA, and a digestion of only the outermost layer of the pit membrane in nearly 100% of the cells examined, with little or no effect on the underlying layers. Treatment of tissue with 25 mM sodiumphosphate buffer also resulted in a shift of the LTE to warmer temperatures but the shift was not as great as in cellulysin-treated tissue. The shift was associated with a partial degradation of the outermost layer of the pit membrane in dogwood (33–45% of the cells examined) but not in peach (3–7% of the cells). Collectively, the data indicate that pectins may be an integral structural element of the pit membrane and that this portion of the cell-wall, along with the underlying amorphous layer, play a major role in forming a barrier to water movement and growth of ice crystals. This barrier allows xylem parenchyma of some species of woody plants to undergo deep supercooling.
2055213061	Abstract: A controlled balance among cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis is required for the maintenance of gastrointestinal mucosa; these processes are influenced by luminal components, such as butyrate and bile acids. Using butyrate-sensitive (BCS-TC2) and butyrate-resistant (BCS-TC2.BR2) human colon carcinoma cells, we wanted to establish whether colon carcinoma cells that acquire resistance to butyrate-induced apoptosis are also resistant to the cytotoxic effect of certain bile acids, contributing, in this way, to the progression of colon carcinogenesis. The effect of bile acids on BCS-TC2 cell viability is dose and time dependent and highly stereospecific. Quantification of the relative percentage of apoptotic cells and caspase-3 activity reveals that deoxycholic acid (DCA) and chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) induce apoptosis in BCS-TC2 cells. BCS-TC2.BR2 cells are consistently less sensitive to their cytotoxic effects, requiring concentrations to induce 50% inhibition (IC50) in cell viab...
2055213101	Herbivorous primary consumers are a key intermediate trophic linkage between primary production from microalgae, macrophytes, and vascular plants and higher-level consumers. Fatty acid (FA) biomarkers are useful for evaluating trophic interactions in aquatic ecosystems because of clear phylogenetic separation of algal group FA signatures. We used a FA-based Bayesian mixing model (FASTAR) to generate quantitative diet estimates of 3 algal phyla for an intertidal herbivorous isopod, Idotea wosnesenskii, at 6 sites in Puget Sound, Washington, USA. We generated a 'resource library' of FA signatures of isopods fed diverse algal diets in 10-wk feeding trials and used these empirical data to parameterize FASTAR, thus accounting for isopod modification of dietary FA. The FA profiles of fast-growing juvenile Idotea were closely related to the signatures of their diets, and several polyunsaturated FA (PUFA) were highly correlated between diet and consumer (e.g. Sigma C-18 omega 6 + C-18 omega 3, 20:4 omega 6, and 20:5 omega 3). We used the model to characterize individual isopod diet variability within sites and to test whether isopods utilize specific algal phyla preferentially or in similar proportions to algae available in the field. The results identified both variation in resource utilization among individual isopods within certain sites, and site level similarities with total available algal cover. Body mass index of wild isopods was highest at sites where the model indicated high utilization (e.g. >30%) of both green and brown algae and low support from red algae. This novel FA-based mixing model approach demonstrated the potential for quantitative diet estimations of fast-growing aquatic herbivorous consumers.
2055213192	The kinetics of association between the quinoxaline antitumor antibiotic echinomycin and DNA have been studied by stopped-flow methods. With natural DNAs, the reaction profile is completely described by a single exponential, the time constant for which varies linearly with the DNA concentration. This bimolecular rate constant is similar for both calf thymus and Micrococcus lysodeikticus DNA (k = 6 X 10(4) M-1 s-1 at 25 degrees C, I = 0.01) and is probably dominated by interaction with relatively weak but abundant binding sites from which the antibiotic dissociates fairly quickly. The observed single exponential suggests a molecular mechanism of binding in which both chromophores of the antibiotic become intercalated simultaneously rather than sequentially; no transition from a mono-intercalated state to a bis-intercalated state could be detected. The reaction is slowed by a factor of about 3 on raising the salt concentration from I = 0.01 to I = 0.5. Binding to poly(dA-dT) is also described by a single exponential, the time constant for which is about 3 times faster than that seen with natural DNAs. By contrast, the interaction with poly-(dG-dC) requires two exponentials for a proper description, the faster of which is similar to that seen with natural DNAs. This may reflect the initial interaction of the antibiotic with two types of sequences, tentatively identified as GpC and CpG, from which it dissociates at very different rates. The differences in kinetic behavior may be explicable on the basis of an alternating B structure for poly(dA-dT) and a more classical B form for poly(dG-dC).
2055213197	We investigated the genetic control of immunoglobulin production and the delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) response produced by an HIV-specific DNA vaccine using several strains of mice. Murine antigen-specific immunoglobulin production was determined by ELISA. The DTH response was assessed in terms of the footpad swelling reaction. All strains of mice, except for B10.RIII and B10.T(6R), exhibited strong immunoglobulin production and footpad swelling in response to the DNA vaccine. In vitro treatment of lymphoid cells with monoclonal antibodies showed that the footpad swelling response was mediated by CD4+8− and Ia— T cells. However, CD8+ T cells did not suppress footpad swelling. There was no difference in the induction of HIV-specific immunoglobulin production or DTH response induced by the DNA vaccine among the strains, suggesting that HIV-specific DNA vaccine is useful for immunizing various populations against HIV-1.
2055213255	"Heterozygosity in diploid eukaryotes often makes genetic studies cumbersome. Methods that produce viable homozygous diploid offspring directly from heterozygous females allow F1 mutagenized females to be screened directly for deleterious mutations in an accelerated forward genetic screen. Streisinger et al.1,2 described methods for making gynogenetic (homozygous) diploid zebrafish by activating zebrafish eggs with ultraviolet light-inactivated sperm and preventing either the second meiotic or the first zygotic cell division using physical treatments (heat or pressure) that deploymerize microtubules. The ""early pressure"" (EP) method blocks the meiosis II, which occurs shortly after fertilization. The EP method produces a high percentage of viable embryos that can develop to fertile adults of either sex. The method generates embryos that are homozygous at all loci except those that were separated from their centromere by recombination during meiosis I. Homozygous mutations are detected in EP clutches at between 50% for centromeric loci and less than 1% for telomeric loci. This method is reproduced verbatim from the Zebrafish Book3."
2055213283	Abstract Non-dividing beating rat heart cells, incubated in a lipid free medium, showed a decrease in malic dehydrogenase and Ca-ATPase and an increase in glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. These changes were associated with a cessation of beating. Serum lipids, added to the medium, prevented the enzyme changes and maintained the beating. Serum lipids also restored the beating and reversed the enzyme changes which were caused by the lipid deficiency.
2055213294	Echinomycin, daunomycin, ethidium bromide, nogalamycin, chromomycin, mithramycin, and olivomycin inhibit RNA synthesis by RNA polymerase by interacting with the DNA template. Chromomycin and olivomycin form complexes with DNA, preferably in the helical form, but not with RNA. These complexes require guanine in DNA and the addition of a stoichiometric amount of bivalent cation. None of the other antibiotics requires the presence of any single base in the template for its action.
2055213355	In addition to expressing clonally distributed antigen-specific and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-restricted receptors, T cells also express non-clonally distributed surface molecules that are involved in T-cell function. Among the most intriguing of the latter are L3T4 and Lyt 2, which are expressed on individual T lymphocytes in striking, though not absolute, concordance with their restriction by either class II or class I MHC determinants, and which are thought to contribute to the overall avidity of T-cell interactions by binding to monomorphic determinants on class II and class I MHC molecules, respectively. To examine the ability of T cells to recognize a single class II domain in the absence of the remainder of the Ia molecule, as well as to evaluate the structural basis for the putative interaction of L3T4 with Ia, a recombinant class II/class I murine MHC gene was constructed and introduced into mouse L cells. Here we demonstrate that a subset of class II allospecific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) can specifically recognize and lyse L-cell transfectants expressing an isolated polymorphic A beta 1 domain, and that anti-L3T4 antibody can block such killing, a result inconsistent with the highly conserved membrane-proximal domains of Ia acting as unique target sites for L3T4 binding.
2055213393	Partial cDNAs encoding a pokeweed antiviral protein were obtained by polymerase chain reaction from the poly(A)+ RNA of seeds, leaves, and roots using two specific primers based on the amino acid sequence of a pokeweed antiviral protein from the seeds (PAP-S). Using the cDNAs as a radioactive probe, 17 and 39 positive plaques were isolated from libraries containing the genomic DNA of Phytolacca americana digested with Bam HI partially and completely, respectively. The plaques were grouped into nine types by Southern hybridization. The type α genomic clone encodes a protein of 294 amino acids. Its amino acid sequence is similar but not identical to that of PAP-S. A comparison of the two amino acid sequences suggested that the deduced protein contains extrapeptides of 24 and 9 amino acids at the NH2 and the COOH terminals, respectively. The putative protein was expressed in Escherichia coli and shown to depurinate the specific adenine of wheat 25S rRNA, indicating that the protein encoded by a type α genomic clone is a functional protein exhibiting RNA N-glycosidase activity.
2055213399	The SPO11/TOPVIA family includes proteins from archaebacteria and eukaryotes. The protein member from the archaebacterium Sulfulobus shibatae is the catalytic subunit of TopoVI DNA topoisomerase. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster, SPO11 is required for meiotic recombination, suggesting a conserved mechanism for the initiation step of this process. Indeed, S. cerevisiae SPO11 has been shown to be directly involved in the formation of meiotic DNA double-strand breaks that initiate meiotic recombination. Here, we report the identification of a Mus musculus Spo11 cDNA, which encodes a protein closely related to all members of the SPO11/TOPVIA family. cDNAs resulting from alternative splicing were detected, suggesting that there are potential variants of the mouse SPO11 protein. By RNA-blotting analysis, expression of the mouse Spo11 gene was detected only in the testis, in agreement with its predicted function in the initiation of meiotic recombination. We mapped the mouse Spo11 gene to chromosome 2, band H2–H4.
2055213416	Magnesium (Mg) deficiency reduces yield and quality of crops as Mg is involved in carbohydrate and protein anabolism. Foliar application of MgSO4 represents a means of ameliorating the nutritional status of crops growing under conditions of deficiency. Foliar Mg application has been demonstrated to increase the chlorophyll concentration and vegetative yield of plants. However, in crop plants used for seed production, the limited number of available studies provides only conflicting results in terms of the efficiency of Mg leaf application on yield and quality. We have examined the effect of increasing Mg foliar application rates on differentially developed leaves and leaf stages with regards to Mg concentration, chlorophyll concentration and biomass formation. Our data reveal that in order to obtain significant effects MgSO4 concentrations in the spraying solution should be higher than 50 mM, as lower concentrations did not lead to significant changes in the vegetative or generative material. Positive effects of the foliar application on chlorophyll concentration and leaf area were only measured in leaves treated with 200 mM foliar MgSO4. The application of Mg did not affect the parameters chlorophyll, ion concentration and leaf area in the newly developing leaves, but it had an important influence with regard to yield traits, especially on the formation of pods. The quality of the seeds with regard to the protein concentration was reduced in response to the magnesium deficiency treatment, but the application of foliar magnesium prevented a significant loss of protein.
2055213453	Toxicity effects and field persistence of the insect growth regulators lufenuron, flufenoxuron and triflumuron were assessed in the laboratory using second and fourth larval instars of Spodoptera littoralis. Laboratory bioassays indicated that lufenuron was more effective on both 2nd and 4th larval instars, as well as killing both larval instars faster than flufenoxuron or triflumuron. Field-laboratory experiments were conducted to show direct and residual effects of the tested IGRs in terms of toxicity and stability. They indicated that all the tested insecticides were stable under field conditions and give high percentages of mortality. Overall, lufenuron was more efficient than the other tested insecticides. In addition, it gave a faster kill in some testing periods. Data presented in this work show greater efficiency of lufenuron in controlling S. littoralis than flufenoxuron or triflumuron. Using this insecticide for cotton leafworm control in cotton fields may give better results under field condition.
2055213458	For some genes, notably essential genes, expression when expression is needed is vital hence low noise in expression is favourable. For others noise is necessary for coping with stochasticity or for providing dice-like mechanisms to control cell fate. But how is noise in gene expression modulated? We hypothesise that gene orientation may be crucial, as for divergently organized gene pairs expression of one gene could affect chromatin of a neighbour thereby reducing noise. Transcription of antisense non-coding RNA from a shared promoter is similarly argued to be a noise-reduction mechanism. Stochastic simulation models confirm the expectation. The model correctly predicts: that protein coding genes with bi-promoter architecture, including those with a ncRNA partner, have lower noise than other genes; divergent gene pairs uniquely have correlated expression noise; distance between promoters predicts noise; ncRNA divergent transcripts are associated with genes that a priori would be under selection for low noise; essential genes reside in divergent orientation more than expected; bi-promoter pairs are rare subtelomerically, cluster together and are enriched in essential gene clusters. We conclude that gene orientation and transcription of ncRNAs, even if unstable, are candidate modulators of noise levels.
2055213498	Summary Objective: The aim of this study was to compare tooth size measurements between patients with supernumerary teeth and a control group. Method: The supernumerary group consisted of 56 subjects (21 females and 35 males) and the control group of 40 subjects (20 females and 20 males). All available permanent teeth on the dental casts were imaged and measured from both buccal and occlusal views using an image analysis system. Mesio-distal, bucco-lingual or occluso-gingival dimensions, area and perimeter were measured from each view. Results: Supernumerary tooth patients tended to have larger tooth size measurements for almost all variables than controls. Significant differences (p  Conclusions: The results are compatible with supernumerary teeth being a complex dental anomaly with a multifactorial aetiology in which both genetic and environmental factors are important. There is some evidence of a local effect with greater differences in tooth dimension adjacent to the site of the supernumeraries.
2055213519	Atopy as defined in terms of IgE responsiveness was reported to be controlled by a single gene in British families, and this concept was further supported by a significant linkage between atopy and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) detected by a DNA probe specific to chromosome 11q13. To confirm this observation in a Japanese population, segregation and linkage analyses were done in four large families. Although segregation patterns of atopy were in agreement with the pattern of autosomal dominant inheritance, there was no significant linkage between atopy and locus 11q13. Alterations in the definitions of atopy did not affect the results. These findings suggested the presence of heterogeneity in genetic elements of atopy, even though atopy may be determined mainly by a single dominant gene.
2055213533	Alkyltransferase-like proteins (ATLs) play a role in the protection of cells from the biological effects of DNA alkylation damage. Although ATLs share functional motifs with the DNA repair protein and cancer chemotherapy target O 6-alkylguanine-DNA alkyltransferase, they lack the reactive cysteine residue required for alkyltransferase activity, so its mechanism for cell protection was previously unknown. Here we review recent advances in unraveling the enigmatic cellular protection provided by ATLs against the deleterious effects of DNA alkylation damage. We discuss exciting new evidence that ATLs aid in the repair of DNA O 6-alkylguanine lesions through a novel repair cross-talk between DNA-alkylation base damage responses and the DNA nucleotide excision repair pathway.
2055213617	A missense mutation has been identified in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH) gene of a Danish patient with hyperphenylalaninaemia (HPA). An A-to-G transition at the second base of codon 414 results in the substitution of Cys for Tyr in the mutant PAH protein. In in vitro expression studies, the Tyr414-to-Cys414 mutant construct produced a protein which exhibited a significant amount of normal PAH enzyme activity, which is consistent with both in vitro and in vivo measurements of PAH activity in HPA patients. Population genetic studies reveal that this mutation is present on 50% of mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in the Danish population. Together with the previously reported codon 158 mutation, these two mutant alleles comprise over 90% of all mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in the Northern Europcan population. Thus, two allele-specific oligonucleotide probes can detect most mutant haplotype 4 chromosomes in Northern Europe.
2055213665	The inhibition of cytokine and monoclonal antibody binding cell surfaces caused by an extract of Psychotria acuminata, a medicinal plant used in the traditional medicine of the people of Belize (Central Africa), was attributed to the presence of pheophorbide a and pyropheophorbide a. Since the binding of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, complement factor 5a as well as epidermal growth factor to target cells was dramatically reduced, the inhibition was not receptor or cytokine specific. In addition, the respective binding of radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies CL203 and R15.7 to the cell surface antigens intracellular cell adhesion molecule-1 and lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1 beta-chain was decreased by pretreatment of cells with pheophorbide a as well. In all cases, the inhibition by pheophorbides was dependent on the simultaneous presence of light, indicating causative involvement of a photodynamic process. These observations are not unique to pheophorbides and can be extended to porphyrins as well as to other photodynamic agents. Cytotoxicity resulting from photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been documented by many studies. Our investigations suggest that the inactivation of cell surface receptors contributes not only to an antitumor effect of PDT but also to the systemic immunosuppression, a serious side effect of PDT.
2055213672	The diet composition and its use by Oreochromis niloticus in Lake Tana, Ethiopia, were studied from monthly samples taken over 13 months. The composition of the diet varied seasonally, with dramatic increases in quality following seasonal climatic events (rainfall, vertical mixing) that bring plant nutrients to the photic zone. Thus, organic matter in the diet increased four-fold, from 150 to 600 mg g-1 of diet. Protein content increased from 71 to 256 mg g-1 ash free dry weight (afdw). Assimilation efficiency increased from 8.3% to 43.2% for afdw, and from near 0 to 45.8% for protein. The fraction of organic matter that is refractory declined from 800 to 27 mg g-1 afdw. Condition factor followed the same pattern, but lagged 1 to 2 months behind changes in diet quality. It was concluded that seasonal pattern of rainfall and temperature affect pelagic food resources, hence heterogeneity in diet quality is temporal to a great extent for O. niloticus in Lake Tana.

2055213792	Bryostatin 1 is a novel macrocyclic lactone activator of protein kinase C (PKC) which has clinical potential as an anti-cancer agent. The mechanism of action of this agent is unknown, but protein kinase C has been implicated. In order to investigate this possibility, we have developed P388 sublines resistant to bryostatin 1, by continuous challenge of the parent cell line with increasing incremental concentrations of the drug over 4 months. Cell lines were established at monthly intervals yielding four sublines: P388/BR/A, which were removed at 1 month; P388/BR/B, obtained after 2 months; P388/BR/C, obtained after 3 months; and P388/BR/D, which were established after 4 months. All four P388/BR sublines show an equal degree of resistance to the growth inhibitory effects of bryostatin 1, with a relative resistance ratio (RR) IC50 of approximately 4,000. The ability of the cytosol of cells to phosphorylate PKC-specific substrate is decreased by 41% for BR/A, 57% for BR/B 80% for BR/C and 94% for BR/D compared with the parental cell line, even when grown in the absence of bryostatin 1 for up to 4 weeks. Similar decreases are seen for cytosolic phorbol ester binding and whole-cell PKC isoenzyme expression. All four P388/BR sublines show high and equal levels of cross-resistance to the PKC activatory phorbol ester, phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). There is no loss of resistance to either bryostatin 1 or PMA up to 3 months after termination of exposure of the sublines to bryostatin 1. There was no significant degree of cross-resistance to daunorubicin in the bryosatin 1-resistant cell lines, P388/BR/A, B, C or D, when compared with the parent cell line, P388.
2055213818	A new sulfate-reducing bacterium was isolated from marine sediment with hydroxyhydroquinone (1,2,4-trihydroxybenzene) as the sole electron and carbon source. Strain HHQ 20 grew slowly with doubling times of > 20 h and oxidized hydroxyhydroquinone, lactate, pyruvate, ethanol, fructose, and ribose incompletely to acetate and carbon dioxide, with concomitant reduction of sulfate to sulfide. Cells were large, vibrio-shaped, and gram-negative with a G+C content of 49.7 mol%, and contained desulfoviridin. Based on analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence, strain HHQ 20 was found to be related to the genus Desulfovibrio but formed a separate line, thus justifying the establishment of a new species within this genus. Hydroxyhydroquinone was the only aromatic compound utilized among numerous hydroxybenzoates, hydroxybenzenes, methoxybenzoates, and methoxybenzenes tested, suggesting that phloroglucinol and resorcinol are not degradation intermediates. Cell-free extracts of strain HHQ 20 did not contain pyrogallol-phloroglucinol transhydroxylase activity. First experiments indicated that this strain uses a new reductive pathway for anaerobic hydroxyhydroquinone degradation.
2055213930	"In many altricial birds, fledglings disperse when they are no longer fed, and this dispersal marks the end of parental care. In some species, however, young remain in close association with their parents after nutritional independence. Because juveniles are still inferior foragers at this stage, they might benefit from parental assistance in locating good feeding sites, but this possibility remains largely unexplored. Here, we show that parents and helpers in pied babbler (Turdoides bicolor) societies use a recruitment call to direct nutritionally independent, but inexperienced, foragers to particular food patches. Observations and a playback experiment indicated that adult babblers use a ""purr"" call to recruit group members to a foraging patch. Creation of experimental foraging patches supported observations that individuals tend to give the call when they are foraging on abundant, divisible food sources and when their group contains independent fledglings (youngsters who are no longer fed directly). Fledglings responded to calls more often than adults, who frequently encountered aggression from the caller if they did, and the fledglings gained significant foraging benefits. This is the first study to demonstrate that altricial birds may use recruitment calls to extend parental care past the period of direct provisioning."
2055213942	The surface coat (SC) of plant nematodes is thought to originate either from the living hypodermis or from secretory glands associated with the excretory system or nervous system. In this study, we investigated the origin of the SC of Meloidogyne incognita by immunolocalization with a monoclonal antibody raised against the surface coat of the preparasitic juveniles (J2). Under the electron microscope, strong labeling was found on the cuticular surface and in the rectal dilation of the J2, while labeling was absent in other parts of the nematode, including the hypodermis, excretory system, nervous system, and digestive system. Because the rectal glands are known to be the origin of the gelatinous egg matrix produced by adult females of Meloidogyne, we also examined sections of mature females from monoxenic cultures of Arabidopsis thaliana. Labeling of the female occurred in the rectal glands and in the gelatinous matrix exuded from the anus. At the ultrastructural level, gold particles were mainly deposited in multivesicular bodies that appeared to be associated with the Golgi bodies of the rectal glands. Our results suggest that at least one component of the J2 SC originates from the rectal gland cells and that the SC of the J2 shares common epitopes with the gelatinous egg matrix of mature females.
2055213962	Abstract This paper discusses the following topics related to polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbon pollution in estuaries: (1) the use of oysters (Crassostrea virginica), hard clams (Mercenaria mercenaria) and brackish water clams (Rangia cuneata) in residue monitoring; (2) the effects of elevated PAH residues on oyster condition; (3) three years of field studies relating PAH sediment contamination to abnormalities in fishes; and (4) laboratory bioassays for effects and bioconcentration modeling. Oysters, hard clams and Rangia have been shown, from 3 years of field studies, to be good monitors of pollution inputs as one proceeds along salinity gradients from 25‰ to 0·5‰. Effects of increased body burdens of PAHs are shown by a lowering of the oysters' condition index, as measured by lipid levels. Fishes inhabiting the Elizabeth River, VA, which is highly contaminated with PAHs, have abnormalities (cataracts, skin lesions, abnormal fins, etc.). These abnormalities have higher incidence in regions of the river where the sediments are more heavily contaminated. Laboratory studies utilizing contaminated sediments have reproduced some of the abnormalities observed in the field. Bioconcentration of PAHs from sediments has been studied with oysters and hard clams. Oysters generally accumulate three times the body burdens of clams exposed to the same suspensions. A faster depuration rate (k2) for clams appears to be responsible for the higher equilibrium body burden of oysters.
2055213984	We present a review of the normal histology of the thymus, with special emphasis on the developmental, morphologic, and immunohistochemical aspects pertinent to the interpretation of thymic lesions in surgical pathology. Attention is drawn to normal variations in histology, embryonal vestiges and developmental defects, involutional and hyperplastic changes, tissue reactions to injury, and biopsy artifacts that may constitute a source of diagnostic problems.
2055213986	The surface saccharide composition of collagenase-dispersed pancreatic cells from adult guinea pig and rat glands was examined by using eight lectins and their ferritin conjugates: Concanavalin A (ConA); Lens culinaris (LCL); Lotus tetragonolobus (LTL); Ricinus communis agglutinins I and II (RCA I, RCA II); Soybean agglutinin (SBA); Ulex europeus lectin (UEL); and wheat germ agglutinin (WGA). Binding studies of iodinated lectins and lectin-ferritin conjugates both revealed one population of saturable, high-affinity receptor sites on the total cell population (approximately 95% acinar cells). Electron microscopy, however, revealed differences in lectin-ferritin binding to the plasmalemma of acinar, centroacinar, and endocrine cells. Whereas acinar cells bound heavily all lectin conjugates, endocrine and centroacinar cells were densely labeled only by ConA, LCL, WGA, and RCA I, and possessed few receptors for LTL, UEL, and SBA. Endocrine and centroacinar cells could be differentiated from each other by using RCA II, which binds to centroacinar cells but not to endocrine cells. Some RCA II receptors appeared to be glycolipids because they were extracted by ethanol and chloroform-methanol in contrast to WGA receptors which resisted solvent treatment but were partly removed by papain digestion. RCA I receptors were affected by neither treatment. The apparent absence of receptors for SBA on endocrine and centroacinar cells, and for RCA II on endocrine cells, was reversed by neuraminidase digestion, which suggested masking of lectin receptors by sialic acid. The absence of LTL and UEL receptors on endocrine and centroacinar cells was not reversed by neuraminidase. We suggest that the differential lectin-binding patterns observed on acinar, centroacinar, and endocrine cells from the adult pancreas surface-carbohydrate-developmental programs expressed during morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation of the gland.
2055214056	Abstract The complete nucleotide sequence of 5-kb DNA fragment immediately 5′ to the rpsU-dnaG-rpoD macro-molecular-synthesis operon in Escherichia coli has been determined. It encodes for six open reading frames. Transcriptional and translational analysis have shown that three of them ( orf x , orf z1 and orf z2 ) are expressed in exponentially growing E. coli cells. The orf x , directly 5′ to the rpsU gene but transcribed in the opposite direction, may be part of the rpsU-dnaG-rpoD macromolecular-synthesis operon.
2055214063	Four NR− lines were selected by their resistance to 100 mM chlorate from X-ray irradiated protoplasts of haploid Petunia hybrida var. Mitchell. The four cell lines were characterized by the presence of xanthine dehydrogenase activity and by complementation tests via protoplast fusion. One mutant (line 1) was classified as defective in the NR apoprotein (tentatively, nia-type) and the other three (lines 2, 3, 4) in the molybdenum cofactor (tentatively, cnx-type). Some NR activity (15 %) could be restored by adding unphysiologically high concentrations of molybdate to the culture medium in two of the cnx-lines (lines 3 and 4). The third cnx-line (line 2) had no NR activity. A complementation analysis via protoplast fusion confirmed that the mutants comprised 3 non-allelic groups. From these results it can be concluded that these NR− mutants are recessive and that two of the cnx-mutants (lines 3, 4) are allelic.
2055214065	Abstract The microplasmodia of the slime mold, Physarum polycephalum , coalesce readily upon contact. The nuclei of the resulting macroplasmodia divide in synchrony approx. 6–8 h after coalescence. If prior to coalescence the microplasmodia are maintained on non-nutrient salts solution, followed by continued starvation of the resulting macroplasmodia, the nuclei also will eventually divide, although at a much later time. This mitosis occurs earlier if the starved microplasmodia are irradiated with UV light prior to coalescence. The most pronounced advancement of mitosis was found in plasmodia which were obtained by coalescence of irradiated, starved microplasmodia with non-irradiated ones.
2055214072	By using a set of 315 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross Lemont (japonica) × Teqing (indica) and a complete linkage map with 186 well distributed RFLP markers and 3 morphological markers, a major gene (Xa4) and 10 QTLs and 9 pairs of epistkis loci conferring horizontal resistance to three strains of Xanthomonas orym pv oryza (Xoo) were mapped. The Teqing allele at Xa4 on chromosome 11 acts as a dominant resistant gene against pathogen race CR4 and CX08, but as an additive QTL with a significantly (47%) reduced effect against the virulent strain, CR6. The major gene Xa4 exhibited stronger degree of race specificity. Most QTLs showed consistent levels of resistance against all three Xoo strains. The results suggest that a high level durable resistance to Xoo may be achieved by cumulative effects of multiple QTL.
2055214124	Supernumerary ring and large marker chromosomes are a characteristic of atypical lipomas and well-differentiated liposarcomas (ALP-WDLPS) and are composed of amplified 12q14-15 sequences in association with variable segments from other chromosomes. Although stably transmitted, these chromosomes contain centromeric alterations, showing no detectable alpha-satellite sequences. We performed C-banding, fluorescence in situ hybridization, and immunostaining with anti-centromere antibodies in 8 cases of liposarcomas with supernumerary rings and large markers, including 5 ALP-WDLPS and 3 dedifferentiated-LPS and high-grade LPS. Our results with alpha-satellite probes and anti-CENPB antibodies confirm the lack of detectable alpha-satellite sequences in the five ALP-WDLPS supernumerary chromosomes, whereas centromeric activity was proved by the detection of kinetochores by using anti-CENPC antibodies. In contrast, the high grade and dedifferentiated liposarcomas showed a different pattern. In 2 cases, amplified chromosome 12 sequences, including amplification of alpha-satellite 12 sequences in 1 case, were present on chromosomes with typical centromeres. In another case, the rings were similar to WDLPS-ALP rings, but a large marker contained a chromosome 5 centromere and amplified alpha-satellite sequences from chromosome 8. ALP-WDLPS is the first example of a tumor class for which the presence of stable analphoid chromosomes is a constant and specific abnormality. Formation of newly derived centromeres, so-called neocentromeres, could be an original and effective way to maintain a selective advantage in neoplastic cells by conferring stability to the supernumerary chromosomes of ALP-WDLPS. The activation of normally non-centromeric sequences might be obtained by an epigenetic mechanism due to the peculiar chromatin conformation of these highly complex chromosomes.
2055214129	Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody drug approved for the treatment of patients with lymphomas. Rituximab’s main killing mechanism is antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). During ADCC, rituximab’s fragment antigen binding (Fab) region binds to the CD20 antigen on the tumor cell and its fragment crystallizable (Fc) region binds to the Fc receptor (FcR) on the natural killer (NK) cells. In this study, two types of molecular interactions (CD20–rituximab, FcR–rituximab) involved in ADCC were measured simultaneously on cells prepared from biopsy specimens of lymphoma patients by utilizing atomic force microscopy (AFM) with functionalized tips carrying rituximab. NK cells were detected by specific NKp46 fluorescent labeling and tumor cells were detected by specific ROR1 fluorescent labeling. Based on the fluorescence recognition, the binding affinity and distribution of FcRs on NK cells, and CD20 on tumor cells, were quantitatively measured and mapped. The binding affinity and distribution of FcRs (on NK cells) and CD20 (on tumor cells) were associated with rituximab clinical efficacy. The experimental results provide a new approach to simultaneously quantify the multiple types of molecular interactions involved in rituximab ADCC mechanism on patient biopsy cells, which is of potential clinical significance to predict rituximab efficacy for personalized medicine.
2055214167	The interaction between a transcription factor and DNA motif (cis-acting element) is an important regulatory step in gene regulation. Comprehensive genome-wide methods have been developed to characterize protein-DNA interactions. Recently, the universal protein binding microarray (PBM) was introduced to determine if a DNA motif interacts with proteins in a genome-wide manner. We facilitated the PBM technology using a DsRed fluorescent protein and a concatenated sequence of oligonucleotides. The PBM was designed in such a way that target probes were synthesized as quadruples of all possible 9-mer combinations, permitting unequivocal interpretation of the cis-acting elements. The complimentary DNA strands of the features were synthesized with a primer and DNA polymerase on microarray slides. Proteins were labeled via N-terminal fusion with DsRed fluorescent protein, which circumvents the need for a multi-step incubation. The PBM presented herein confirmed the well-known DNA binding sequences of Cbf1 and CBF1/DREB1B, and it was also applied to elucidate the unidentified cis-acting element of the OsNAC6 rice transcription factor. Our method demonstrated PBM can be conveniently performed by adopting: (1) quadruple 9-mers may increase protein-DNA binding interactions in the microarray, and (2) a one-step incubation shortens the wash and hybridization steps. This technology will facilitate greater understanding of genome-wide interactions between proteins and DNA.
2055214340	Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is considered to be a single gene disorder, most commonly the result of a F508del mutation in the CFTR gene. However, patients homozygous for F508del mutation show a considerable variation in disease severity. Consistent with this observation, recent genome wide association studies identified secondary genes that modify disease. A SNP in the putative promoter region of SLC6A14 gene showed the highest significance (p=1.28x10−12). SLC6A14 is a cationic/neutral amino acid transporter, which transports 2Na+, 1 Cl− and a basic/neutral amino-acid into the cell from the apical surface of intestinal/bronchial epithelium. We hypothesize that expression of SLC6A14 is protective against meconium ileus, a CF phenotype detected at birth. To test this hypothesis we over-expressed SLC6A14 in BHK cells stably expressing either WT or F508del-CFTR. We measured CFTR channel activity using the halide sensitive fluorophore, SPQ. We found that CFTR function is enhanced with over-expression of SLC6A14 in cells expressing WT CFTR or F508del CFTR (after rescue of its trafficking defect), (p<0.05). This suggests a possible functional interaction between SLC6A14 and CFTR. We also monitored the functional interaction of SLC6A14 and CFTR in Caco-2 cells, an intestinal cell line that endogenously expresses both CFTR and SLC6A14. Caco-2 cells form three-dimensional, cyst-like cultures wherein CFTR mediated secretion determines the volume of its internal cavity. We found that the area of the cyst cavity increases upon cAMP stimulation of CFTR stimulation by 5.5 fold and that this expansion was decreased by 44% in the presence of the SLC6A14 inhibitor (α-methyltryptophan). These results suggest that SLC6A14 exerts a positive effect on regulated CFTR function and future studies will explore the possibility that agonists of SLC6A14 could constitute a means for therapeutic intervention.(Studies supported by grants to C.E.B and J.M.R. from CFC, CIHR)
2055214350	Lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are widely distributed in the plant kingdom, but their functions remain elusive. The proteins AlLTP2-4 were isolated from three related Allium plants: garlic (A. sativum L.), Welsh onion (A. fistulosum L.), and Nanking shallot (A. ascalonicum L.). These novel proteins comprise a new class of LTPs associated with the Ace-AMP1 from onion (A. cepa L.). The AlLTP genes encode proteins harboring 132 common amino acids and also share a high level of sequence identity. Protein characteristics and phylogenetic analysis suggest that LTPs could be classified into five distinct groups. The AlLTPs were clustered into the most distantly related plant LTP subfamily and appeared to be restricted to the Allium species. In particular, the number of amino acids existing between the fourth and fifth Cys residue was suggested as a conserved motif facilitating the categorization of all the LTP-related proteins in the family. Unlike other LTPs, AlLTPs harboring both the putative C-terminal propeptide and N-terminal signal peptide were predicted to be localized to cytoplasmic vacuoles. When a chimeric GFP protein fused with both N-terminal and C-terminal AlLTP2 signal peptides was expressed in rice cells, the fluorescence signal was detected in the endomembrane compartments, thereby confirming that AlLTPs are an unprecedented intracellular type of LTP. Collectively, our present data demonstrate that AlLTPs are a novel type of LTP associated with the Allium species.
2055214359	Abstract A temperature-sensitive mutant of Rauscher murine leukemia virus, is 29 was used to estimate the minimal time to complete budding and the time needed for morphological maturation at 31°. It was found that budding can be completed in 2 min. The first mature forms were seen 20–30 min after shiftdown from 39 to 31°.
2055214432	OBJECTIVE Little is known of the hormone environment of the developing early human embryo. We have therefore measured selected steroids in the intrauterine fluids of early pregnancy.  DESIGN Measurement of progesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, oestradiol-17β, testoste rone, androstenedione, cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate in matched samples of coelomic fluid, amniotic fluid and maternal serum collected before pregnancy termination from 12 women between 8 and 12 weeks gestation.  RESULTS Mean concentrations of progesterone, oestradiol-17β and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone in coelomic fluid were respectively 20, 6 and 2 times greater than in maternal serum and 8, 13 and 2.6 times those in amniotic fluid. Concentrations of testosterone and androstenedione were highest in maternal serum and lowest in amniotic fluid. Cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate were found in intrauterine fluids only at the limit of detection but in normal concentrations in maternal serum.  CONCLUSIONS Coelomic fluid contains relatively high concentrations of progesterone, oestradiol-17β and 17α-hydroxyprogesterone which may be synthesized locally. Amniotic fluid contains lower concentrations of steroids (other than progesterone) than are found in coelomic fluid or maternal serum. Free diffusion of steroids across the amnion appears limited. This may constitute a mechanism to protect the embryo from unwanted exposure to biologically active steroids.
2055214445	Hydatidosis is a widely endemic helminthic disease vectored in human by the larval stage of the metacestode Echinococcus granulosus. It is characterized by the long-term coexistence of chronic infection with detectable humoral and cellular responses against the macroparasite. Previous studies demonstrated interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and nitric oxide (NO) production (in vivo and in vitro) during hydatidosis. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NO production after IFN-gamma induction may constitute a host defense against E. granulosus. We also investigated the IFN-gamma effect on protoscolices (larval form of the parasite) viability in coculture with hydatid patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMCs from hydatic patients incubated with IFN-gamma (100 U/mL) alone are effective in the killing of protoscolices. This scolicidal activity is concomitant with elevation of nitrite levels. NO release and cytotoxic activity are inhibited by N-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA), a specific inhibitor of the NO pathway and increased by L-arginine, an NO precursor, and tetrahydrobiopterin (BH4), a nitric oxide synthase (NOS) cofactor. Our results indicate that IFN-gamma mediated iNOS induction as one of host defense mechanism against human E. granulosus infection.
2055214480	Neurotransmitters can have diverse effects that occur over multiple time scales often making the consequences of neurotransmission difficult to predict. To explore the consequences of this diversity, we used the buccal ganglion of Aplysia to examine the effects of GABA release by a single interneuron, B40, on the intrinsic properties and motor output of the radula closure neuron B8. B40 induces a picrotoxin-sensitive fast IPSP lasting milliseconds in B8 and a slow EPSP lasting seconds. We found that the excitatory effects of this slow EPSP are also mediated by GABA. Together, these two GABAergic actions structure B8 firing in a pattern characteristic of ingestive programs. Furthermore, we found that repeated B40 stimulation induces a persistent increase in B8 excitability that was occluded in the presence of the GABA B receptor agonist baclofen, suggesting that GABA affects B8 excitability over multiple time scales. The phasing of B8 activity during the feeding motor programs determines the nature of the behavior elicited during that motor program. The persistent increase in B8 excitability induced by B40 biased the activity of B8 during feeding motor programs causing the motor programs to become more ingestive in nature. Thus, a single transmitter released from a single interneuron can have consequences for motor output that are expressed over multiple time scales. Importantly, despite the differences in their signs and temporal characteristics, the three actions of B40 are coherent in that they promote B8 firing patterns that are characteristic of ingestive motor outputs.
2055214546	Lactobacillus plantarum PA18, a strain originally isolated from the leaves of Pandanus amaryllifolius, contains a pR18 plasmid. The pR18 plasmid is a 3211bp circular molecule with a G+C content of 35.8%. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed two putative open reading frames, ORF1 and ORF2, in which ORF2 was predicted (317 amino acids) to be a replication protein and shared 99% similarity with the Rep proteins of pLR1, pLD1, pC30il, and pLP2000, which belong to the RCR pC194/pUB110 family. Sequence analysis also indicated that ORF1 was predicted to encode linA, an enzyme that enzymatically inactivates lincomycin. The result of Southern hybridization and mung bean nuclease treatment confirmed that pR18 replicated via the RCR mechanism. Phylogenetic tree analysis of pR18 plasmid proteins suggested that horizontal transfer of antibiotic resistance determinants without genes encoding mobilization has not only occurred between Bacillus and Lactobacillus but also between unrelated bacteria. Understanding this type of transfer could possibly play a key role in facilitating the study of the origin and evolution of lactobacillus plasmids. Quantitative PCR showed that the relative copy number of pR18 was approximately 39 copies per chromosome equivalent.
2055214567	ES-1 cells, which showed a higher sensitivity to the cytocidal action of estradiol were isolated from a human breast cancer MCF-7 cell line. Growth of ES-1 cells was inhibited by a dose of 17-beta estradiol that stimulated the growth of the parental MCF-7 cells. Proteins secreted from MCF-7 and ES-1 cells when cultured with 17-beta estradiol were compared by sodium dodecyl sulfate-containing polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Addition of estradiol to culture medium enhanced secretion of a protein of molecular mass of 52 kDa in media for both MCF-7 and ES-1 cell lines, but the secretion of a second 67 kDa protein was enhanced about 10-fold only in ES-1 cells. The analysis by SDS-PAGE of culture medium immunoprecipitated with anti-tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) antibody demonstrated that the band of 67 kDa protein specifically secreted from estradiol-treated ES-1 cells contained t-PA. Zymography assays, quantitative immunoreactive assays, and Northern analysis showed about 5-fold specific increase by estradiol of t-PA with molecular mass of 65-70 kDa in ES-1 but not in its parental MCF-7 cells. Cellular level of the plasminogen activity was also specifically enhanced in ES-1 cells by estradiol, but only a slightly in MCF-7 cells. By contrast, another urokinase-type PA (u-PA) with molecular weight of 55 kDa showed very low level activity in both MCF-7 and ES-1 cell lines in the presence of estradiol. Formation of t-PA mRNA was specifically enhanced in ES-1 cells when ES-1 cells were treated for more than 12 h with 10(-8) M 17-beta estradiol. Estradiol did not elongate the lifetime of t-PA mRNA in ES-1 cells. A unique phenotype of ES-1 cells in response to estradiol is discussed in relation to activating expression of the t-PA gene.
2055214633	Abstract A description is given of a pre-treatment for milk samples which allows it to be filtered through 0.2 μm pore-size membrane filters without reducing the initial number of bacteria. The efficiency of the method was demonstrated in milk samples inoculated with Escherichia coli O25:H-42, a food-borne pathogen, by comparison with a control in tryptone soya broth (TSB). No significant differences were found between direct microscopic counts in milk samples and controls in TSB.
2055214661	One hundred and fifty years ago, the English naturalist Henry Walter Bates first developed the theory of mimicry ( 1 ). Based on his field observations in the Amazon, he argued that the uncanny likeness of unrelated butterflies is an evolutionary adaptation whereby edible butterflies avoid predation by imitating the coloration of venomous butterfly species without paying the cost of arming themselves. Such “Batesian mimicry” is a dynamic parasitic game between three players, in which a harmless species (the mimic) escapes predation by imitating the warning signals of harmful species (the model) that a shared predator (the dupe) has learned to avoid. On page 578 of this issue, Thorogood and Davies show that Batesian mimicry dynamics also apply to the evolutionary game between cuckoos and their hosts ( 2 ).
2055214667	understanding of intestinal lipid metabolism, driven at least in part through attempts to mitigate the ongoing epi-demic of obesity and metabolic disease ( 1 ). For example, weight loss strategies including gastric bypass surgery have brought to light unanticipated adaptations in metabolic homeostasis, including altered bile acid signaling and shifts in host-microbial ecology ( 2 ). As a result, our under-standing of the role of the intestine in lipid metabolism now includes an expanded role in a range of homeostatic processes, including glucose metabolism, energy utiliza-tion, and growth and inﬂ ammation to name but a few. Our Thematic Review Series will selectively cover several of these areas. In particular, we have solicited reviews that summarize a detailed elucidation of the pathways regulat-ing the ﬂ ux of complex lipids across the small intestinal enterocyte, including an emerging role in energy utiliza-tion and the role of circadian cues. We have also solic-ited reviews to provide a thorough understanding of the molecular, genetic, and regulatory pathways involved in modulating intestinal bile acid transport and signaling and new insights into the role of nuclear hormone receptors in the intestine in maintenance of systemic lipid metabolism. In the ﬁ rst article in our series, Eric Yen and his colleagues will review the role and regulation of enterocyte triglyceride synthesis, including the abundantly expressed genes acyl CoA:monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 (MGAT2) and acyl CoA:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 (ACAT1), whose functions have been examined in numerous model sys-tems and have been shown to play crucial roles in the regu-lation of fat metabolism and energy utilization. There is heightened interest also in the possibility that these pathways represent druggable targets for obesity and met-abolic disorders ( 3 ). In the second article, Mahmood Hussain and Xiaoyue Pan have summarized some of the recent developments in our understanding of the relevance of circadian rhythm to intestinal lipid metabolism. They summarize the role of innate intestinal Clock genes and outline the integration of central signals (via the suprachiasmatic nucleus) with
2055214696	RNA interference (RNAi) is an efficient post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanism that is induced by double-stranded RNA. Applications of RNAi have gained increasing attention since the groundbreaking discovery that small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules can be used to inhibit gene expression in mammalian cells in a sequence-specific manner. Numerous meetings have recently been held in this field, but the organiser from EF International succeeded in bringing some of the leading academic scientists and company researchers together in London to present and discuss exciting new results. Major topics covered in the meeting included the recent progress in understanding the basic mechanism of RNAi, genome-wide RNAi-based screens for target discovery, and approaches to use RNAi for target validation in cell culture and in animal models. In addition, borders and caveats of the technology, such as off-target effects and a possible induction of the interferon response by siRNA, have been discussed intensively....
2055214701	The polypore genus Tomophagus was created to segregate one peculiar species, Ganoderma colossum, from the genus Ganoderma. Recent molecular studies have established the validity of this monotypic genus. Here we report the discovery of a second species of Tomophagus, T. cattienensis sp. nov., from Cat Tien National Park in southern Vietnam, a lowland forest that has been designated as a Biosphere Reserve by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). Recognition of this new species is based on combined evidence from morphology, cultural characteristics, and ITS rDNA barcodes. The discovery of this new species may have implications for the discovery of novel bioactive compounds for pharmaceutical use and/or for the pulp industry.
2055214702	The central dogma of molecular biology deals with the detailed residue-by-residue transfer of sequential information. It states that such information cannot be transferred from protein to either protein or nucleic acid.
2055214710	In the present article we summarize our results concerning the in situ ultrastructural organization of the nuclear steps of mRNA production using several cellular models including normal noninfected cells, herpes simplex virus type 1 and adenovirus type 5 infected cells, and transiently transfected cells. We confirm that perichromatin fibrils are the in situ morphological expression of nascent transcripts and the main support of splicing. Special emphasis is devoted to the clusters of interchromatin granules which seem to be involved in several central functions including accumulations of snRNP components as well as sorting and/or regulation of export of different RNA species.
2055214792	Aus verschieden alten Fundstellen im Tertiar Bulgariens werden fur die fossile Flora Bulgariens neue Arten der Gattungen Picea, Illicium, Trigonobalanopsis, Fagus, Pterocarya, Phellodendron, Halesia, Toddalia, Rutaspermum, Swida, Paliurus, Itea, Potamogeton und Cladium auf Grund karpologischer Funde mitgeteilt. Es wird auch eine neue Cladiocarya-Art (C. maxima sp. nova) beschrieben. Neu fur die Balkanhalbinsel-Flora ist der Nachweis der Gattungen Trigonobalanopsis, Halesia, Phellodendron, Toddalia, Rutaspermum und Illicium. Die Funde sind von vegetations- und klimageschichtlicher Bedeutung in der Balkan-Region.    New finds of Picea, Illicium, Trigonobalanopsis, Fagus, Pterocarya, Phellodendron, Halesia, Toddalia, Rutaspermum, Swida, Paliurus, Itea, Potamogeton, and Cladium are described from Balkan fossil floras, based on carpological material from the Bulgarian Tertiary. A new species of Caldiocarya (C. maxima sp. nova) is described as well. The genera Trigonobalanopsis, Halesia, Phellodendron, Toddalia, Rutaspermum and Illicium are recorded for the first time in the Balkan Peninsular region. These new finds are of importance for the vegetation and climatic history of the Balkan region.
2055214802	The morphogenesis of blood cell lineages in channel catfish Ictalurus punctatus, from head and trunk kidney and spleen imprints as well as from blood smears of bled and control fish, showed that early maturation stages resembled those in higher vertebrates. The erythroid lineage consisted of the proerythroblast, erythroblasts (basophilic, polychromatic, orthochromic), young erythrocyte and erythrocyte. The rare bilobed erythrocyte seemed to be a cell in apoptosis while old erythrocytes and erythroplastids represented remnants of this process. Maturation stages of neutrophils and basophils encompassed the granuloblast, young progranulocyte, progranulocyte and metagranulocyte. The basophilic lineage was regularly present in kidneys, rare in spleen and absent from blood. It contained large Sudan Black and PAS-negative, water soluble granules and small PAS-positive ones. Lymphocytes with azurophilic granulation occured regularly in kidneys and spleen. Monoblasts and promonocytes in kidneys preceded monocytes. A phagocytic lineage devouring apoptotic blood cell remnants was present in kidneys and spleen. Its youngest identified stage (promacrophage) resembled more a granuloid cell without granules than a monocytoid one. The larger, young macrophages contained a few to several ingestions and the very large mature macrophages were loaded with them. The latter two stages corresponded to cells in melano-macrophage centres (macrophage aggregates). Precursor stages of the thrombocyte were not identified.
2055214908	Ovulation is believed to contribute to the development of ovarian cancers that derive from the ovarian surface epithelium (OSE). The process of ovulation is synonymous with inflammation and inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1α (IL-1α) have recently been shown to induce both inflammatory and anti-inflammatory responses in human OSE (HOSE) cells. In this study we directly compared levels of IL-1α-induced gene expression by analysing the levels of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11βHSD) types 1 (11βHSD-1) and 2 (11βHSD-2), cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), IL-1 receptor (IL-1R) and glucocorticoid receptor α (GRα) mRNA between normal HOSE cells and cell lines derived from poorly differentiated (SKOV-3, BG-1, PEO-4) and well-differentiated (PEO-14) ovarian adenocarcinoma. In HOSE cell cultures, and to a lesser extent PEO-14 cells, the basal mRNA levels of COX-2 and 11βHSD-1 were relatively high and further shown to be induced in response to IL-1α (for HOSE cells; >20-fold, P 3fold, P<0.05). However, whereas HOSE cells expressed a low level of 11βHSD-2 mRNA that was only mildly responsive to IL-1α (1.3-fold, P<0.001), all cell lines exhibited a higher basal level of 11βHSD-2 mRNA that was in some cases further stimulated in PEO-4 cells (five-fold; P<0.05) or suppressed in SKOV-3 cells (two-fold; P<0.01) in response to IL-1α. All cells tested expressed IL-1R and, with the exception of BG-1, GRα. These results indicate that cell lines derived from ovarian cancers have lost the ability to respond normally to inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1α. The finding that normal OSE cells, in contrast to cell lines derived from patients with ovarian adenocarcinoma, abundantly express 11βHSD-1 mRNA but are essentially devoid of 11βHSD-2 mRNA supports the concept that the pattern of 11βHSD isoform gene expression is a defining feature of neoplastic cellular transformation, which might have particular relevance to the ovary.
2055214996	A total of 920 samples from blood donors screened as anti-HCV negative by two third-generation screening assays (Ortho Diagnostics v3.0 and Murex Diagnostics VK48) were tested by two supplementary anti-HCV assays, RIBA III (Ortho Diagnostics) and Western blot (Murex Diagnostics VK68). Six (0.65%) of the samples gave scorable bands by RIBA III and 5 (0.54%) by Western blot. Only single-band reactivity was seen and there was no consensus reactivity between the two assays. Single-band reactivity in supplementary assays, especially in samples from low-risk populations, needs to be interpreted with care before being taken as indication of genuine previous or current HCV infection.
2055215071	Danell K. 1985: Population fluctuations of the muskrat in coastal northern Sweden. Acta theriol., 30, 12: 219—227 [With 1 Table & 3 Figs.] The fluctuations of five muskrat populations in coastal northern Sweden are described over periods of 7—14 years. The population in Sladan was studied more intensively since it colonized this area around 1963. During the last 14 years it fluctuated with a periodicity of 4 years. This time length is identical to the vole cycle length in the area. However, the muskrat population reached their peaks one year after the vole peaks. In the above population the predation pressure by foxes upon muskrats was recorded yearly for 9 years. The predation pressure was negatively correlated with vole density. Two other muskrat populations which settled in 1955 and 1963, respectively, displayed fluctuations similar to those of the voles, and the muskrat peaked with a one year dephasing. Two muskrat populations which had colonized their localities more recently (in 1970 and 1975) remained for some years at low levels and then steadily increased. The population fluctuations were not directly related to the changes in the vole populations.
2055215146	As reported previously, the peculiar intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion bodies (IEIBs) extensively appeared in the autopsied brain tissue from a 49-year-old man having familial ataxia with cerebrospinal fluid abnormality, and histochemically showed abundant proteins, but few lipids and carbohydrates. Ultrastructurally, many membrane-bound vacuoles derived from the distended cisterns of rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum (RER) appeared in the neurons. They were filled with fine granular, less dense materials. The IEIBs, shown as a homogeneous dense core, were found in some of the vacuoles. Similar vacuoles also appeared in astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, vascular pericytes, ependymal and choroidal epithelial cells. It is suggested that the vacuoles result from the accumulation of metabolic products in the distended RER cisterns of the cells in the central nervous system, presumably representing a genetically determined functional abnormality of the RER in protein synthesis and/or transport.
2055215148	PurposeDNA repair enzymes have a critical role in cellular maintenance and survival. The enzyme apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease/redox factor 1 (APE/ref1), a key protein in the base excision repair pathway, displays both repair and redox control. We examined the role of APE/ref1 in pediatric embry
2055215210	Alfalfa of different maturities was produced simultaneously by varying the timing of the first cut. Groups of fistulated steers were confined and simultaneously fed alfalfa herbage at three stages of growth once a day. More bloat occurred during the vegetative stage of growth, it declined during bud development, and it was absent during bloom. This pattern occurred with both the number of cases of bloat and with the severity of bloat, which was much greater during the vegetative stage. Feed quality components also varied significantly between stages as did the leaf:stem ratio. Key words: Cattle, bloat, legumes, Medicago sativa L
2055215223	Oncolytic viruses capable of tumor-selective replication and cytolysis have shown early promise as cancer therapeutics. We have developed replication-competent attenuated herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) mutants, named HF10 and Hh101, which have been evaluated for their oncolytic activities. However, the host immune system remains a significant obstacle to effective intraperitoneal administration of these viruses in the clinical setting. In this study, we investigated the use of these HSV-1 mutants as oncolytic agents against ovarian cancer and the use of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (MCs) as carrier cells for intraperitoneal therapy. MCs were efficiently infected with HSV-1 mutants, and MCs loaded with HSV-1 mutants caused cell killing adequately when cocultured with cancer cells in the presence or absence of HSV antibodies. In a mouse xenograft model of ovarian cancer, the injection of infected carrier cells led to a significant reduction of tumor volume and prolonged survival in comparison with the injection of virus alone. Our results indicate that replication-competent attenuated HSV-1 exerts a potent oncolytic effect on ovarian cancer, which may be further enhanced by the utilization of a carrier cell delivery system, based on amplification of viral load and possibly on avoidance of neutralizing antibodies.
2055215230	Seventeen mangrove species of eight families at seven riverine and fringe habitats in Goa West India were surveyed for Arbuscular Mycorrhizal (AM) fungal diversity. Sixteen species were found to be mycorrhizal and one species showed no AM fungal colonization. AM root colonization was recorded at all seven sites and ranged from 6%–77%. Maximum root colonization was recorded in Excoecaria agallocha (77%) and minimum colonization in Avicennia marina (6%). Paris-type colonization was predominant at all sites. Auxiliary cells were recorded in roots of Acanthus ilicifolius, Ceriops tagal and Sonneretia alba. AM fungal root colonization and spore density varied by plant species and site. Site average spore density ranged from 1.84 spores·g−1 to 0.54 spores·g−1 of soil. In total, 28 AM fungal species of five genera, viz. Glomus, Acaulospora, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Entrophospora, were recovered. Glomus was the dominant genus, three species of which were sporocarpic forms. Maximum site species richness (SR) ranged from 16 to 5. Species richness was maximum in A. ilicifolius where seven species of three genera were recovered. Based on relative abundance (RA) and isolation frequency (IF), two common species, viz. G. intraradices and A. laevis, were recovered from all seven sites.
2055215283	A fed-batch culture of methanol-utilizing microorganism (Corynebacterium sp. XG), a vitamin B 12 producer, was carried out with constant feed of substrate. Experimental results agreed with the theorical model proposed in the literature. Using this feeding system, the final biomass and vitamin B 12 concentration reached 16.3 g/l and 880 μg/l respectively after a 53 h incubation period at 30 °C.
2055215305	AbstractEarly-life experiences can dramatically affect adult traits. However, the evolutionary origins of such early-life effects are debated. The predictive adaptive response hypothesis argues that adverse early environments prompt adaptive phenotypic adjustments that prepare animals for similar challenges in adulthood. In contrast, the developmental constraints hypothesis argues that early adversity is generally costly. To differentiate between these hypotheses, we studied two sets of wild female baboons: those born during low-rainfall, low-quality years and those born during normal-rainfall, high-quality years. For each female, we measured fertility-related fitness components during years in adulthood that matched and mismatched her early conditions. We found support for the developmental constraints hypothesis: females born in low-quality environments showed greater decreases in fertility during drought years than females born in high-quality environments, even though drought years matched the early c...
2055215333	Phenoloxidase (PO) plays an important role in arthropod melanization. Previously, a prophenoloxidase (PmproPO1) gene was cloned and characterized from the hemocytes of the black tiger shrimp, Penaeus monodon. In the present study, we report a novel proPO gene (PmproPO2) belonging to the proPO family identified from the P. monodon EST database (http://pmonodon.biotec.or.th). The full-length sequence of PmproPO2 consists of 2513 bp encoding a predicted 689 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass and pI of 79.21 kDa and 6.69, respectively. It is predicted to possess all the expected features of proPO members, including two putative tyrosinase copper-binding motifs with six histidine residues and a thiol ester-like motif, sharing 67% amino acid sequence identity with PmproPO1. Tissue distribution analyses revealed that the two proPO genes are primarily expressed in the hemocyte. Gene silencing of either PmproPO1 or PmproPO2 or both by RNA interference (RNAi) resulted in a significant decrease in the respective endogenous proPO mRNA level in hemocytes and a reduction of total PO enzyme activity by 75, 73 and 88%, respectively. Experimental infection of P. monodon with the pathogenic bacterium, Vibrio harveyi, revealed that PmproPO silenced shrimps were more susceptible to bacterial infection than the control GFP injected shrimps, and suggesting that the two proPOs are important components in the shrimp immune defense.
2055215337	BET proteins are a group of epigenetic regulators controlling transcription through reading acetylated histone tails and recruiting transcription complexes. They are considered as potential therapeutic targets in many distinct diseases. A novel synthetic bromodomain and extraterminal domain (BET) inhibitor, JQ1, was proved to suppress oncogene transcription and inflammatory responses. The present study was aimed to investigate the effects of JQ1 on inflammatory response and bone destruction in experimental periodontitis. We found that JQ1 significantly suppressed lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated inflammatory cytokine transcription, including interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), as well as receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-B ligand (RANKL)-induced osteoclast markers, such as c-Fos, nuclear factor of activated T-cells, cytoplasmic, calcineurin-dependent 1 (NFATc1), tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and cathepsin K in vitro. JQ1 also inhibited toll-like receptors 2/4 (TLR2/4) expression and nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) phosphorylation and nuclear translocation. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (ChIP-qPCR) revealed that JQ1 neutralized BRD4 enrichment at several gene promoter regions, including NF-κB, TNF-α, c-Fos, and NFATc1. In a murine periodontitis model, systemic administration of JQ1 significantly inhibited inflammatory cytokine expression in diseased gingival tissues. Alveolar bone loss was alleviated in JQ1-treated mice because of reduced osteoclasts in periodontal tissues. These unprecedented results suggest the BET inhibitor JQ1 as a prospective new approach for treating periodontitis.
2055215351	The diploid male has already been recorded for Melipona Illger, and herein, in Melipona seminigra merrillae Cockerell and Melipona interrupta manaosensis Schwarz. This paper was carried out at the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas da Amazonia (INPA), Manaus, AM, Brazil. We produced and monitored 31 new colonies of M. s. merrillae and 32 new colonies of M. i. manaosensis. We sampled 2,995 pupae of M. s. merrillae and 2,020 of M. i. manaosensis. In colonies with a 1 : 1 sex ratio, male diploidy was confirmed by cytogenetic analysis and workers’ behavior. We estimated 16 sex-determining alleles in M. s. merrillae and 22 in M. i. manaosensis. In colonies of M. i. manaosensis in a 1 : 1 sex ratio, workers killed the males and the queen that produced them soon after they emerged, as predicted. This behavior was not registered for M. s. merrillae, and sex ratios did not stay 1 : 1, indicating polyandry for this species.
2055215393	The present study compared the effect of a single or a repeat challenge with the Gram-negative pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis on the local inflammatory response within subcutaneous chamber model in mice. Subcutaneous chambers were implanted 2 weeks prior to the final challenge. The repeat-challenge (REP) group received two intrachamber bacterial injections 14 days apart, while the single-injection group (SIN) received only a single bacterial challenge. Injection of saline was used as the control. The cellular contents of the chamber exudates were used for differential cell counts, and the supernatants were analysed for tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and interleukin (IL)-10 levels. Immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) and IgG2a levels to P. gingivalis in the exudates were also determined. The results showed that the leucocyte counts increased significantly post-challenge, and the REP group showed the highest number of lymphocytes and neutrophils. Both P. gingivalis-challenged groups exhibited significant increase in TNF-alpha and IL-10 levels at day 1 post-challenge. TNF-alpha levels in the chamber exudate were threefold higher in the REP group compared with the SIN group on day 1 post-challenge (P < 0.05). In contrast, IL-10 levels were significantly lower in the REP group 1 day post-challenge compared with the SIN group. The REP group had significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma at baseline, and this difference remained significant 1 day post-challenge. Analysis of antibody levels to P. gingivalis showed that while the control and the SIN groups had no anti-P. gingivalis IgG in the chamber exudate during the 7-day study period, the REP group showed high anti-P. gingivalis IgG levels. In addition, the titres of IgG2a were fivefold higher than the IgG1 titres. The results showed that a repeat local challenge with P. gingivalis augmented the proinflammatory cytokines TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma, while inhibiting the accumulation of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. This shift towards a T helper 1 (Th1)-dominant response was reflected in the relatively high anti-P. gingivalis IgG2a titres in the local inflammatory environment 7 days post-challenge.
2055215409	The movements of a commercially important species, Diplodus vulgaris, were assessed in a marine-protected area to test whether their spatial and temporal activity patterns differ during and outside of their spawning season. Twelve adults were caught along the north-eastern coast of a small Mediterranean island, tagged with acoustic transmitters and released within or just outside the integral reserve. Fish detected, during both the seasons showed strong fidelity for the study area before and during the spawning season and their home range did not differ between seasons. Home ranges reached an asymptote between 12 and 174 days after release. Home range estimated by kernel utilization distributions ranged from 9,876 to 89,914 m2, with core areas of 946 to 7,274 m2. Temporal patterns frequently showed a dominant diel rhythm with most of detections occurring at daytime, independently of season. The variability in the movement patterns of D. vulgaris was lower between seasons (i.e., during and outside the spawning season) than at smaller temporal scale (i.e., between day and night) and was largely affected by inter-individual differences. Some conclusions arising from this and previous findings are useful to orient future studies on coastal fish movement and have direct implications for MPAs design.
2055215524	The anthrax toxin lethal factor (LF) and matrix metalloproteinase-3 (MMP-3, stromelysin-1) are popular zinc metalloenzyme drug targets, with LF primarily responsible for anthrax-related toxicity and host death, while MMP-3 is involved in cancer- and rheumatic disease-related tissue remodeling. A number of in silico screening techniques, most notably docking and scoring, have proven useful for identifying new potential drug scaffolds targeting LF and MMP-3, as well as for optimizing lead compounds and investigating mechanisms of action. However, virtual screening outcomes can vary significantly depending on the specific docking parameters chosen, and systematic statistical significance analyses are needed to prioritize key parameters for screening small molecules against these zinc systems. In the current work, we present a series of chi-square statistical analyses of virtual screening outcomes for cocrystallized LF and MMP-3 inhibitors docked into their respective targets, evaluated by predicted enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constant and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between predicted and experimental bound configurations, and we present a series of preferred parameters for use with these systems in the industry-standard Surflex-Dock screening program, for use by researchers utilizing in silico techniques to discover and optimize new scaffolds.
2055215525	Cannibalism of the entire brood by mouthbrooding males was observed in the cardinal fish,Apogon doederleini, in warm temperate waters of southern Japan. This filial cannibalism always occurred within a day of spawning. Males preferentially ate broods produced by females smaller than themselves and by non-resident females, and always changed mates after cannibalism. Cannibalistic males re-mated more quickly than males whose broods were experimentally removed. These results indicate that cannibalistic males take advantage of multiple mate availability, by eating the first brood and rearing the second. It is suggested that filial cannibalism in this fish is associated with mating strategies of females that can shorten inter- spawning intervals by changing mates.
2055215548	Feeding ecology of individually marked male and female Herring gulls breeding at the colony of Treberon (France) has been compared for two successive periods. During the first period (1983–1988), most of the breeders intensively used a nearby refuse tip which was the main feeding site of the colony. At the refuse tip. food supplies were more abundant and predictable than at the other available feeding sites. In the second period (1989–1990), an incinerator was running so that the amount of food dumped at the tip decreased by 80%. Analysis of regurgitations showed sex differences in diet: females ate more earthworms and less garbage than males. During the period 1989–1990, the difference between the two sexes increased markedly. After the opening of the incinerator, the proportion of females seen at the tip diminished whereas the proportion of males did not change. The females which continued to use the tip were less often seen than the males. It is suggested that the differences between the foraging state...
2055215649	"Individuals infected by the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) demonstrate progressive depletion and qualitative dysfunction of the helper T4 (CD4+) cell population. Mechanisms proposed for attrition of CD4+ T cells include direct cytopathicity of these mature cells following infection as well as infection of early T-lymphocyte progenitors. The latter mechanism could lead to failure to regenerate mature functioning CD4+ T cells. The present study determines the susceptibility of thymocytes at various stages of maturity to infection with HIV-1. Various normal thymocyte populations were inoculated with HIV-1, including unfractionated (UF), CD3- CD4- CD8- [""triple negative"" (TN)], CD4+ CD8+ [""double positive"" (DP)] thymocytes, and thymocyte populations obtained by limited dilution cloning. Cultures were studied for the presence of HIV-1 DNA by polymerase chain reaction in addition to examination for reverse transcriptase activity. We determined that transformed T-cell and thymocyte cell lines completely lacking CD4 were not susceptible to infection by HIV-1, whereas all of the following lines were: UF thymocytes (70-90% CD4hi+); DP thymocytes (99% CD4hi+); TN thymocytes (0% CD4hi+); and TCR alpha beta +, TCR gamma delta +, or CD16+ CD3- (natural killer) thymocyte clones expressing variable levels of CD4 and representing the progeny of TN thymocytes. [TCR alpha beta + and TCR gamma delta + refer to the chains of the T-cell antigen receptor (TCR), and CD4hi refers to a strong rightward shift (greater than 30 linear channels) of the CD4 curve on flow cytometric analysis compared with control.] Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to CD4 (T4a epitope) but not to CD3 (T3) were capable of blocking infection of mature and immature CD4hi+ thymocytes. Moreover, anti-CD4(T4a) mAbs also inhibited infection of CD4hi- TN thymocytes, indicating that these T-cell precursors--despite their apparent ""triple negativity"" (CD3- CD4hi- CD8-)--expressed sufficient CD4 molecules to become infected. Cell sorter analysis with a panel of CD4 mAbs demonstrated a mean shift of the mean fluorescence channel (MFC) with CD4 mAbs on TN thymocytes of 6 +/- 4 MFC units. Thus, intrathymic T-cell precursors and their progeny representing many stages of T-cell ontogeny are susceptible to infection by HIV-1, including early TN thymocytes, which express very low levels of CD4. Infection of multiple stages and multiple subsets of the T-cell lineage in man, mediated via the CD4 molecule, may explain the inability of the T-cell pool to regenerate in the setting of progressive HIV infection."
2055215839	Abstract Two new limonoids, humilinolides E and F, were isolated from the seeds of Swietenia humilis Zucc. (Meliaceae). In addition, the known compounds humilinolides A-D, humilin B, swietenin C, methyl-2-hydroxy-3-β-isobutyroxy-1-oxomeliac-8 (30)-enate, methyl-2-hydroxy-3-β-tigloyloxy-1-oxomeliac-8 (30)-enate and swietemahonin C were isolated for biological evaluation, with swietenin and swietemahonin C reported for the first time from this species. From the seeds of Guarea grandiflora A.D.C. (Meliaceae) three protolimonoids, namely 21-α-acetylmelianone, melianone and melianodiol, and three limonoids, gedunin, 7-deacetoxy-7-oxogedunin and 6-α-acetoxygedunin, were obtained. The isolated compounds were identified by spectroscopic methods. Some of the limonoids and protolimonoids were evaluated for their effects on the European corn borer, Ostrinia nubilalis, in comparison with toosendanin a commercial insecticide derived from Melia azederach.
2055215900	Brassinosteroids play diverse roles in plant growth and development. Plants deficient in brassinosteroid (BR) biosynthesis or defective in signal transduction show many abnormal developmental phenotypes, indicating the importance of both BR biosynthesis and the signaling pathway in regulating these biological processes. Recently, using genetics, proteomics, genomics, cell biology, and many other approaches, more components involved in the BR signaling pathway were identified. Furthermore, the physiological, cellular, and molecular mechanisms by which BRs regulate various aspects of plant development, are being discovered. These include root development, anther and pollen development and formation, stem elongation, vasculature differentiation, and cellulose biosynthesis, suggesting that the biological functions of BRs are far beyond promoting cell elongation. This review will focus on the up-to-date progresses about regulatory mechanisms of the BR signaling pathway and the physiological and molecular mechanisms whereby BRs regulate plant growth and development.
2055215932	The WT1 gene was analysed using DNA from a Wilms' tumour derived from a patient with the WAGR syndrome using single strand conformation polymorphism analysis and polymerase chain reaction sequencing. A 14-bp insertion was found in the intron part of the splice donor site of exon 7 and was a tandem duplication of an upstream exon sequence. This mutation would be expected to disrupt the correct processing of the WT1 mRNA and is predicted to result in a non-functional protein. This observation further supports the role of WT1 in Wilms' tumorigenesis in patients with constitutional 11p13 deletions.
2055215955	Abstract Type classification data from the Holstein Association of Canada on 354,308 daughters of 13,694 sires were subdivided into 20 groups of approximately equal size according to herd average final score. Genetic and environmental variances were estimated for each group by Henderson's new method. Traits considered and their heritabilities averaged over groups were: final score .13; final class .11; dairy character .17; capacity .24; rump .16; feet and legs .10; mammary system .12; fore udder .12; rear udder .12; size .31. Regressions of genetic variances on group number ordered according to herd final score indicated significant trends only for rump and feet and legs for which higher genetic variances were found for higher type scores. Regressions of environmental variances on group number were significant for all traits. Higher environmental variances were found for lower final scores, final class, dairy character, and capacity, but the opposite was observed for size. The distribution of environmental variances across groups was U-shaped for rump, feet and legs, fore udder, and rear udder; lowest variances were associated with intermediate scores for overall type.
2055216049	ABSTRACT Mancalla emlongi, new species, is the fifth species described in this extinct genus of flightless auks and is the third to be described from the late Pliocene San Diego Formation of southern California. The species is based on a right ulna that is markedly larger than in any other member of the genus.
2055216053	Recent studies have indicated that lactoferrin may act as a cell mitogen. The effect of human and bovine lactoferrins on the proliferation and differentiation of a human intestinal epithelial cell line (Caco-2) was investigated and compared with that of human transferrin. Caco-2 cells were cultured in serum-free media supplemented with both iron-unsaturated and -saturated forms of the iron-binding proteins. Cell proliferation and differentiation were evaluated by examining growth curves and measuring sucrase and alkaline phosphatase activities of brush border membrane fractions, respectively. The iron-binding status of lactoferrins and transferrin affected the proliferation of Caco-2 cells. The iron-saturated forms of human (S-hLf), bovine (S-bLf) lactoferrins and human transferrin (S-hTf) enhanced cell proliferation, while iron-unsaturated forms (U-hLf, U-bLf, and U-hTf) suppressed it. Iron-binding status also determined the effect of lactoferrin and transferrin on cellular differentiation, but this effect differed for different brush border enzymes. S-hTf enhanced sucrase activity more than S-hLF or S-bLf. Both U-hLf and U-bLf markedly suppressed sucrase activity. U-hTf suppressed alkaline phosphatase activity appreciably, while the other iron-binding proteins showed no significant effect on it. Lactoferrin and transferrin may modulate the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, but their efficacy depends on their saturation with iron.
2055216069	The developmental pattern of the myelin-associated 5'-nucleotidase and its regulation by L-3,3',5,-triiodothyronine (T3) have been demonstrated in a culture system of cells dissociated from embryonic mouse brain. Hypothyroid calf serum containing low levels of T3 (31 ng/100 ml), and thyroxine, T4 (less than 1 microgram/ml), was used in the culture medium in place of normal calf serum (T3, 103 ng/100ml; T4, 5.7 micrograms/ml) to render the cultures responsive to exogenously added T3. By means of T3 supplementation, the lower levels of enzyme activity observed in the cultures grown in the presence of hypothyroid calf-serum containing medium could be restored to a considerable extent although not completely to normal values. Half-maximal stimulatory effect was obtained at 3.9 X 10(-8)M T3 concentration. Among the various substrates tested, 5'-AMP, 5'-UMP and 5'-CMP were equally good, while 5'-GMP yielded approximately half the activity.
2055216074	Abstract Low-molecular-weight α-crystallin ( α L -crystallin) isolated from decapsulated lens of goat ( Capra hiscus ) has been purified to an apparently homogeneous population. Goat α L -crystallin closely resembles its bovine counterpart in size, shape, exposition of sulfhydryl groups, subunit composition and the nature of its UV-absorption profile. Like bovine α L -crystallin, dissociated subunits of goat α L -crystallin assemble upon reassociation into a particle of almost half the size of the native one. However, subunits of goat α L -crystallin are found to contain more aromatic amino acid residues than those of bovine subunits leading to a higher value of extinction coefficient ( E 1 cm 1% ) at 280 nm for the goat protein.
2055216092	The photosynthetic behaviour and composition of photosynthetic pigments of four Cosmarium strains collected from different geographic areas were examined under moderate and photoinhibitory white light by means of PAM fluorometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. Generally, all of the Cosmarium strains displayed the photosynthetic performance and the composition of xanthophyll cycle pigments corresponding to that of high-light adapted plants and algae, when grown under the standard laboratory conditions. However, photoinhibitory treatments provoked several strain- and species-specific characteristics despite the long-term cultivation in laboratory conditions. The typical arctic taxon, C. crenatum var. boldtianum, displayed an incomplete violaxanthin cycle yielding an accumulation of antheraxanthin during high light stress, which is considered as an adaptation to occasional high irradiances in the polar zone due to the albedo. So far, the violaxanthin/antheraxanthin turnover was known only in some prasinophycean algae. Antheraxanthin actively participated in the heat dissipation from PSII centres in C. crenatum, as concluded from a significant positive correlation between non-photochemical quenching (NPQ) and the quantity of antheraxanthin. In contrast, all the other Cosmarium strains displayed a complete violaxanthin de-epoxidase action during the high light treatments, as judged from the relatively high production of zeaxanthin which participated in thermal dissipation of excess energy.
2055216100	Aspects of the reproductive biology of the common shrimp Crangon crangon (L.) were studied in Port Erin Bay, Isle of Man, Irish Sea. Size at sexual maturity was determined from the proportions of ovigerous females and of females with maturing ovaries. The size at which 50% of females are mature is estimated (±95% confidence intervals) as 12.5±0.48 mm carapace length. Based on the proportions of ovigerous females and of mature females, the main breeding season was from January to June. Mean ovarian dry weights indicated two broods (winter and summer), with females bearing winter broods (WB) having higher gonad indices than those with summer broods (SB). WB females with non-eyed eggs and with eyed eggs differed in the regression of ovarian dry weight on carapace length, indicating preparation for laying a second brood. In both broods the moult stages of berried females were related to egg stage. Moulting will occur following the release of the brood. During embryonic development, mean egg length and egg volume were larger in all stages, and the mean dry weight of individual eggs of all stages heavier, in WB than in SB; there was no difference in egg number, however. Consequently, reproductive investment, the proportion of female weight devoted to egg production, was 67% higher in WB (0.20±0.04) than in SB (0.12±0.03). There is a significant effect of egg volume on brood weight, but not on egg number. In both broods, egg number was a negatively allometric function of female body size in non-eyed eggs and an isometric function of female body size in eyed eggs. Brood mortality during incubation was higher in SB (17%) than WB (10%). Differences in the reproductive variables and investment between the two broods of C. crangon are discussed in the light of reproductive strategies and life history.
2055216141	The chemokine CXCL12, via its receptor CXCR4, promotes increased survival of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) B cells that express high levels of ζ-chain–associated protein (ZAP-70), a receptor tyrosine kinase associated with aggressive disease. In this study, we investigated the underlying molecular mechanisms governing this effect. Although significant differences in the expression or turnover of CXCR4 were not observed between ZAP-70+ and ZAP-70− cell samples, CXCL12 induced greater intracellular Ca2+ flux and stronger and more prolonged phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase (MEK) in the ZAP-70+ CLL cells. The CXCL12-induced phosphorylation of ERK and MEK in ZAP-70+ CLL cells was blocked by sorafenib, a small molecule inhibitor of RAF. Furthermore, ZAP-70+ CLL cells were more sensitive than ZAP-70− CLL cells to the cytotoxic effects of sorafenib in vitro at concentrations that can readily be achieved in vivo. The data suggest that ZAP-70+ CLL cells may be more responsive to survival factors, like CXCL12, that are elaborated by the leukemia microenvironment, and this sensitivity could be exploited for the development of new treatments for patients with this disease. Moreover, sorafenib may have clinical activity for patients with CLL, particularly those with ZAP-70+ CLL.
2055216227	Tissue cadmium and zinc levels in Steller sea lions have been analysed to elucidate the body distribution of these metals and their age-related accumulation. A significant correlation between age (0.7–8.8 year old) and renal and hepatic cadmium concentration was noted. Of the tissues examined, the kidney manifested the highest cadmium content (mean: 20.9 μg g−1 dry wt). A similar zinc distribution pattern was observed; its concentration was more uniform among tissues than that of cadmium. The tissue cadmium concentration in the Steller sea lion was lower than in other pinnipeds from various areas, possibly due to their feeding habits which may represent a major pathway of metal accumulation.
2055216229	Abstract The development of immunity to Ostertagia ostertagi and Cooperia oncophora and interactions between these species were investigated in experimentally infected calves. Parasitological, serological and histological parameters were used for assessing immune responses. No conclusive evidence of an effect of C. oncophora on the course of an O. ostertagi infection in calves could be shown. Following a challenge with C. oncophora and O. ostertagi of C. oncophora primed calves, no significant reductions in establishment rate, faecal egg counts, worm length or the percentage of early fourth stage larvae could be demonstrated. Results also confirmed earlier work showing the very different degrees of immunity conferred following immunisation with either C. oncophora or O. ostertagi. While a protective immunity was generated in the case of C. oncophora, continuous infection of calves with 420 000 L3 of O. ostertagi during almost 5 months induced immune reactions which affected growth and fecundity of the worms but not the establishment rate.
2055216316	Abstract The relative DNA content (mg/g wet wt.) of the lizard liver declined sharply during postnatal stage remaining almost constant during the laterhalf of the life-span. The total DNA (mg/whole liver wet wt.) was found to increase with increasing bodyweight. The relative RNA content (mg/g wet wt.) reached the peak level at 16 g body weight and declined thereafter. The total RNA (mg/whole liver wet wt.) showed the same tendency as observed for total DNA. The relative protein content (mg/g liver wet wt.) showed the highest concentration at about 30 g bodyweight and remaining constant thereafter. When expressed on the basis of DNA (mg protein/mg DNA) the protein content also reached a peak level at about 30 g body weight but showed decline thereafter. The total protein (mg/whole liver wet wt.) indicated a steady rise with increasing age but at much slower rate beyond 50 g body weight. The RNA/ DNA ratio was highest at about 16 g body weight and declined thereafter. The RNA/Protein ratio also showed the similar trend.
2055216330	Trisomy 13 is one of the most common trisomies in clinically recognized pregnancies and one of the few trisomies identified in liveborns, yet relatively little is known about the errors that lead to trisomy 13. Accordingly, we initiated studies to investigate the origin of the extra chromosome in 78 cases of trisomy 13. Our results indicate that the majority of cases (>91%) are maternal in origin and, similar to other autosomal trisomies, the extra chromosome is typically due to errors in meiosis I. Surprisingly, however, a large number of errors also occur during maternal meiosis II ( approximately 37%), distinguishing trisomy 13 from other acrocentric and most nonacrocentric chromosomes. As with other trisomies, failure to recombine is an important contributor to nondisjunction of chromosome 13.
2055216337	The floral units of Triuridaceae, commonly regarded as flowers, may equally plausibly be interpreted as pseudanthia, i.e., modified and highly reduced partial inflorescences. This hypothesis is new for Triuridaceae, but earlier authors have noted strong similarities between the inflorescences of Cyclanthaceae and Pandanaceae (Pandanales) and the putatively pseudanthial floral units of some Alismatales (e.g., Potamogeton). The morphology of the floral units of Triuridaceae, particularly the female and hermaphrodite structures, closely resembles a smaller version of a Pandanus pistillate inflorescence. In some species of Pandanus, the female flower consists of a single uniovulate carpel with a single stigma, as in Triuridaceae. This striking morphological similarity is remarkable in the context of recent evidence from a single 18S nuclear rDNA sequence for Sciaphila that placed it as sister to Pandanaceae within Pandanales. However, because pseudanthia have been reported in both Alismatales and Pandanales, ...
2055216349	Abstract It was reported that in Fe-inefficient Zea mays L. mutant yellow stripe 1 ( ys1 ), unlike other plant species, the regulation of ferritin accumulation upon iron overload is controlled at the post-transcriptional level. We conducted similar experiments with another Fe-inefficient maize mutant, yellow stripe 3 ( ys3 ), affected in a different step of iron acquisition. Uptake of iron by roots was followed in leaves of both mutant and wild type plants using ferritin mRNA and protein accumulation. We can thus demonstrate that in maize the presence of iron controls ferritin synthesis at the transcriptional level. Because of the difference in the response of ys1 and ys3 , we also postulate the presence of a second factor acting translationally, related to the level of ferrated phytosiderophore.
2055216357	Natural killer (NK) cell activity, OK-432-augmented-NK cell activity, concentrations of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the culture supernatants of lymphocytes stimulated with OK-432, and subsets of NK cells and memory T cells were analyzed in 42 children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) receiving maintenance chemotherapy. Natural killer and augmented-NK cell activities, and concentrations of IFN-gamma in the supernatants of cultured lymphocytes, were significantly lower in the patients with ALL than in age-matched control children. Among the NK cell subsets, proportions of CD57+ cells in the patients with ALL were significantly higher than in the controls, and proportions of a memory T cell subset (CD4+ CD29+ T cells) in the patients were also significantly higher than in the controls. These results suggest that the function of NK cells and memory T cells that are considered as IFN-gamma producing cells, may be defective in ALL, and that CD57+ cells and CD4+ CD29+ cells may be resistant to or recover rapidly from suppression by cytotoxic chemotherapy.
2055216411	Cardiovascular disease, which accounts for the highest morbidity and mortality in the United States, has several major risk factors, including aging and diabetes. Overweight and obesity, especially abdominal obesity, have been increasingly implicated as independent risk factors in the development of cardiovascular disease. Metabolic and/or diabetic cardiomyopathy has been especially associated with excess body weight caused by chronic over-nutrition and high-fat feeding. In the initial stages, obesity is now understood to cause significant dysregulation of cardiac fatty acid and glucose metabolism. These abnormalities are due, in part, to increased oxidative stress, which in turn can cause deleterious effects on intracellular signaling pathways that control cellular growth and proliferation. This increase in oxidative stress is coupled with reduced anti-oxidant species and dysregulation of metabolic signaling pathways. The cardiomyopathy seen with obesity is associated with increased interstitial fibrosis and diastolic dysfunction. Over time, evolving abnormalities include hypertrophy and systolic dysfunction, eventually leading to heart failure.
2055216451	This study investigated whether molecules spontaneously transported inside cells, like glucose derivatives, can also be used as electropermeabilization markers. Uptake of a fluorescent deoxyglucose derivative (2-NBDG) by normal and electropermeabilized cells in culture was analyzed. 2-NBDG was added to DC-3F cell suspensions and cells, exposed or not to eight square-wave electric pulses of 100-μs duration and of appropriate field amplitude at a repetition frequency of 1 Hz or 5 kHz, were incubated at 37 °C. 2-NBDG uptake was temperature-, concentration- and time-dependent in cells submitted or not to the electric pulses. In spite of significant uptake of 2-NBDG mediated by GLUT transporters into nonpermeabilized cells, the electric pulses significantly increased about ten to hundred times the 2-NBDG uptake into the cells. The increase in the field amplitude from 900 to 1,500 V/cm resulted in a progressive increase of 2-NDBG. Our results show that under the conditions of in vivo exposure duration to FDG and the physiological concentration of d-glucose, electric pulses increased 2-NBDG uptake into electropermeabilized cells. Under our experimental conditions, the percentage of permeabilized cells within the population of cells exposed to electric pulses remained at the same level regardless of the pulse frequency used, 1 Hz or 5 kHz. The findings showed that glucose derivatives can also be used to detect electropermeabilized cells exposed to electric pulses.
2055216466	Two-year old mallard ducks were exposed to Prudhoe Bay crude oil, Corexit dispersant or a mixture of the two. Percent hatching success, egg loss, and duckling survival were calculated for each clutch in the study. The absence of any differences among groups in general parental and incubation behavior, egg and nest temperatures, and duckling survival indicate that neither a light to moderate slick of undispersed oil or oil-Corexit 9527 mixture nor Corexit 9527 at a concentration up to 53 ppm in the water can be expected to reduce breeding success through behavioral alteration. A supplemental test showed that bird oiling can be reduced by dispersing part of the surface oil into the water column. (JMT)
2055216495	ABSTRACTViral coat protein gene was detected in thirty isolates of different soil-borne fungi, using cotton leaf curl coat protein specific primers (geminiviruses). Out of them, seven fungal isolates showed positive results (a band with a molecular size of 680 bp). The products amplified from two isolates, Macrophomina phaseolina (Tassi) Goid. and Mucor racemosus Bull., were excised from the gel, purified and sequenced. The sequence analysis revealed that the amplicons were coat protein genes of geminivirus. The gene isolated from M. phaseolina was similar to that of wheat dwarf geminivirus with identity not exceeding 36%; and the coat protein isolated from M. racemosus was 43% identical with the maize streak geminivirus. These low identities suggest that the amplification products belong to new records of geminiviruses designated (MpDV) and (MrDV), respectively. The isolate from M. racemosus was selected to investigate the viral transmission into the phytopathogenic fungus Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. So...
2055216529	The content of the phospholipid metabolites, phosphocholine, phosphoethanolamine, glycerophosphorylcholine and glycerophosphorylethanolamine was measured in chemical extracts from 46 human breast carcinoma using 31P NMR spectroscopy. Some patients had received therapy prior to tumour resection. The data were therefore stratified into two groups: (i) all tumours; and (ii) untreated tumours. Three indices of tumour proliferation i.e., mitotic index, Ki67 and S-phase fraction were determined on tissue from the same tumours and were found not to correlate with the content of any of these metabolites. In addition oestrogen-receptor status and density, tumour grade and DNA ploidy were obtained on some tumours. The phosphocholine content was higher in high grade tumours when compared with low grade tumours. There was no apparent relationship between DNA ploidy and the content of any of these metabolites. Glycerophosphorylcholine content of oestrogen-receptor positive tumours correlated with receptor density. However, there was no significant difference between receptor positive and negative tumours in the content of any of the phospholipid metabolites measured.
2055216551	Abstract 1. 1. Monoclonal antibody 2.36.71.41 produced to human haptoglobin forms precipitates with goat haptoglobin in double immunodiffusion and electroimmunodiffusions. 2. 2. Solid-phase immunoenzymatic assay (ELISA) based on the reaction of the monoclonal antibody 2.36.71.41 with goat haptoglobin can be used for quantitative estimation of haptoglobin content in goat sera. 3. 3. The minimum detectable concentration of goat haptoglobin is 0.03 μg/ml.
2055216588	Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced vascular endothelial cell (VEC) dysfunction is an important contributing factor in vascular diseases. Recently, we found that LPS impaired VEC by inducing autophagy. Our previous researches showed that a butyrolactone derivative, 3-benzyl-5-((2-nitrophenoxy) methyl)-dihydrofuran-2(3H)-one (3BDO) selectively protected VEC function. The objective of the present study is to investigate whether and how 3BDO inhibits LPS-induced VEC autophagic injury. Our results showed that LPS induced autophagy and led to increase of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and decrease of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in Human umbilical vein vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, LPS significantly increased p8 and p53 protein levels and the nuclear translocation of p53. All of these effects of LPS on HUVECs were strongly inhibited by 3BDO. Importantly, the ROS scavenger N-acetylcysteine (NAC) could inhibited LPS-induced autophagy and knockdown of p8 by RNA interference inhibited the autophagy, p53 protein level increase, the translocation of p53 into nuclei and the ROS level increase induced by LPS in HUVECs. The data suggested that 3BDO inhibited LPS-induced autophagy in HUVECs through inhibiting the ROS overproduction, the increase of p8 and p53 expression and the nuclear translocation of p53. Our findings provide a potential tool for understanding the mechanism underlying LPS-induced autophagy in HUVECs and open the door to a novel therapeutic drug for LPS-induced vascular diseases.
2055216687	"A novel pathway for physiological ""cross-talk"" between the insulin receptor and the regulatory Gi-protein has been demonstrated. We tested the hypothesis that a coupling defect between Gi and the insulin receptor is present in the liver of obese patients with and without type II diabetes. Insulin 1 x 10(-9) M (approximately ED50) and 1 x 10(-7) M (Max) inhibited pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of Gi in human liver plasma membranes from lean and obese nondiabetic patients. However, 1 x 10(-7) M insulin was without effect in membranes from patients with type II diabetes. This coupling defect was not intrinsic to Gi, since Mg2+ and GTP gamma S inhibited pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation in both diabetic and nondiabetic patients. Binding of insulin of the alpha-subunit and activation of the tyrosine kinase intrinsic to the beta-subunit of the insulin receptor are not responsible for the coupling defect. 125I insulin binding is the same in obese patients with or without diabetes. Tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor is decreased in diabetes. However, a monoclonal antibody to the insulin receptor (MA-20) at equimolar concentrations with insulin equally inhibits pertussis toxin-catalyzed ADP ribosylation of Gi without activating tyrosine kinase or insulin receptor autophosphorylation. Immunodetection of G-proteins suggested that Gi3 alpha was normal in diabetes and Gi1-2 alpha was decreased by 40% in the diabetic group as compared to the obese nondiabetic group but was normal when compared to the lean non diabetic group. We conclude that the novel pathway of insulin signaling involving the regulatory Gi proteins via biochemical mechanisms not directly involving the tyrosine kinase of the insulin receptor is altered in obese type II diabetes and offers a new target for the search of the mechanism(s) of insulin resistance."
2055216690	The nucleotide sequence of a 4936-bp genomic DNA fragment from the thermophilic bacterium Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus has been determined. The fragment contains three open reading frames (ORFs). The product of the incomplete first ORF is highly homologous to α-galactosidases (melibiases). The second ORF corresponds to the lacA gene for a thermostable β-galactosidase. The product of the third ORF is similar to α-D-mannosidases. A putative ρ-independent terminator is located immediately downstream of the lacA stop codon, suggesting a cotranscription of the α- and β-galactosidase genes. The deduced molecular weight of LacA is 86 kDa. LacA belongs to glycosylhydrolase family 2 (GH2). Native recombinant LacA is a dimer and shows the highest activity at pH 5.7–6.0 and 75–80°C. LacA is most active with lactose (480 units per mg protein, K m = 30 mM); the activities with pNP-Gal and oNP-Gal are 330 and 420 units per mg protein, respectively. Immobilized on aldehyde silochrome, LacA is even more thermostable and retains its high activity.
2055216694	"Toroviruses are enteric viruses belonging to the Nidovirales order that infect different animal species and humans. The lack of ""in vitro"" culture systems for toroviruses, except for the prototype Berne virus or BEV, isolated originally from an infected horse, has hampered their study and the development of diagnostic assays. This report describes a real time RT-PCR method to detect porcine torovirus (PToV) RNA in clinical fecal samples using primers corresponding to the gene coding for the nucleocapsid protein which are conserved in all PToV strains known to date. This method can be used to determine viral loads allowing quantitation within a range between 10(1) and 10(8) genomic units per reaction tube. The assay was evaluated with 48 rectal swabs from piglets from a Spanish farm. Nineteen out of 48 animals were shedding virus at the time of sample collection, indicating a high incidence of PToV infection in this farm. This is the first report showing the presence of PToV in Spain. The real time RT-PCR assay described in this report provides a rapid, highly sensitive, specific and reliable detection and quantitation method enabling future PToV epidemiological studies."
2055216760	Insulin resistance is a major feature of noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. This resistance appears to involve molecules, apart from the insulin receptor, that are capable of altering its function. Previously, we reported that dermal fibroblasts from a female patient with insulin resistance and noninsulin-dependent diabetes produced an inhibitor of insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity. We have now studied inhibitors in fibroblasts from four additional patients (one male and three females) with severe insulin resistance. Although clinical features were diverse, these patients had in common normal fasting glucose values, with fasting and postprandial hyperinsulinemia. The fibroblast insulin receptor content was within the normal range, but both basal and insulin-stimulated tyrosine kinase activity in fibroblast extracts were markedly decreased compared to those in extracts of fibroblasts from nondiabetic subjects. Studies revealed that these fibroblasts contained a glycoprotein inhibitor of insuli...
2055216878	The stability and deletion-size-distribution profiles of leading strand (CAG)(75) and (CTG)(137) trinucleotide repeat arrays inserted in the Escherichia coli chromosome were investigated upon overexpression of the single-stranded DNA-binding protein (SSB) and in mutant strains deficient for the SbcCD (Rad51/Mre11) nuclease. SSB overexpression increases the stability of the (CAG)(75) repeat array and leads to a loss of the bias towards large deletions for the same array. Furthermore, the absence of SbcCD leads to a reduction in the number of large deletions in strains containing the (CTG)(137) repeat array.
2055216959	Neonicotinoids, such as imidacloprid, are key insecticides extensively used for control of Nilaparvata lugens. However, imidacloprid resistance has been reported in many Asian countries in recent years. To understand the roles of the chlorine atom of pyridyl group on insecticidal activity and resistance, the atom was removed to generate an imidacloprid analogue DC-Imi (DesChlorine Imidacloprid). DC-Imi showed significantly higher toxicity than imidacloprid in the susceptible strain of N. lugens, but had medium level cross-resistance in an imidacloprid-resistant strain. In Xenopus oocyte expressed nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) Nlα1/rβ2, the inward currents evoked by DC-Imi were detected and could be blocked by typical nAChRs antagonist dihydro-β-erythroidine (DHβE), which demonstrated that DC-Imi acted as an agonist on insect nAChRs. The efficacy of DC-Imi on Nlα1/rβ2 was 1.8-fold higher than that of imidacloprid. In addition, the influence of an imidacloprid resistance associated mutation (Y151S) on agonist potencies was evaluated. Compared with the wild-type receptor, the mutation reduced maximal inward current of DC-Imi to 55.6% and increased half maximal effective concentration (EC50 ) to 3.53-fold. Compared with imidacloprid (increasing EC50 to 2.38-fold of wild-type receptor), Y151S mutation decreased DC-Imi potency more significantly. The results indicated that the selective and possibly high toxicities could be achieved through the modification of 6-chloro-3-pyridyl group in imidacloprid and other neonicotinoids.
2055217000	Pulsatile release of GnRH-1 is critical to stimulate gonadotropes of the anterior pituitary. This secretory pattern seems to be inherent to GnRH-1 neurons, however, the mechanisms underlying such episodical release remain unknown. In monkey nasal explants, the GnRH-1 population exhibits synchronized calcium events with the same periodicity as GnRH-1 release, suggesting a link, though the sequence of events was unclear. GnRH-1 neurons in mouse nasal explants also exhibit synchronized calcium events. In the present work, GnRH-1 release was assayed in mouse nasal explants using radioimmunology and its relationship with calcium signaling analyzed. GnRH-1 neurons generated episodical release as early as 3 d in vitro (div) and maintained such release throughout the period studied (3–21 div). The pulse frequency remained constant, suggesting that the pulse generator is operative at an early developmental stage. In contrast, pulse amplitude increased 2-fold between 3 and 7 div, and again between 7 and 14 div, sug...
2055217026	Two female patients with functioning adrenocortical carcinomas had plasma ACTH detectable by RIA at presentation. In both patients there was evidence for biological activity of ACTH. There was no evidence for an ectopic source of ACTH, nor for a pituitary tumour. Urinary steroid analysis showed patterns of multiple hormone secretion characteristic of adrenocortical carcinomas. The finding of detectable ACTH concentrations in a patient with Cushing's syndrome does not exclude the presence of an adrenocortical tumour.
2055217106	Several different edible oils were compared for their ability to modify eicosanoid biosynthesis following experimentally-induced myocardial ischemia and reperfusion in the rat. Two types of palm oil [neutralized, bleached, and deodorized (NBDPO) and refined, bleached, and deodorized (RBDPO)] and partially hydrogenated soybean oil (SBO) were tested against a diet supplemented with sunflower seed oil (SSO) rich in n−6 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA). Fish oil (FO) rich in n−3 PUFA, with its known cardioprotective actions, served as an internal reference point for the study. Test oils were fed as a 12% (w/w) supplement for nine months before the induction of myocardial ischemia and reperfusion. Palm oil diets exerted effects indistinguishable from the SBO group against cardiac arrhythmia, which occurred following alterations to coronary blood flow. Arrhythmic potentials, as expressed by a hierarchical scale (0–9) of arrhythmia score, were: SSO, 1.5±0.5; FO, 0.9±0.4; SBO; 3.1±0.5*; NBDPO, 3.2±0.5*; RBDPO, 3.3±0.6*,* P<0.05 vs. SSO. Following ischemia and reperfusion, both SSO and RBDPO groups tended to show an increase in myocardial prostacyclin, with the effect being more prominent in the RBDPO group (SSO, 10%; RBDPO, 25%). Thromboxane production was reduced in the FO group. Interestingly, cardiac muscle from both FO and palm oil groups displayed a reduced capacity to produce 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid SSO, 591.9±95.8; SBO, 375.5±48.9; NBDPO, 287.2±64.7*; RBDPO, 230.9±80.2**; FO, 203.7±81.4** (ng/g dry wt,* P<0.05,** P<0.01). No clear relationship was seen between the availability of 20∶4n−6 in myocardial phospholipids and eicosanoid profile. Data suggests that fatty acid composition of edible oils is not the only determinant of arrhythmic vulnerability and eicosanoid production.
2055217107	Abstract With the aim of gathering information about the possibility of culturing mussels ( Mytilus galloprovincialis ) in a south Mediterranean oligotrophic area, different lots of mussels were placed in culture at depths of −5 m and −15 m and their growth monitored on a monthly basis. Temperature and salinity were measured in situ and water samples were collected at different depths each month. Total suspended matter (TSM) and its inorganic (ISM) and organic (OSM) fractions were analysed by gravimetry and loss on ignition. Photosynthetic pigments (chlorophyll- a and phaeopigments), particulate organic carbon (POC) and nitrogen (PON), particulate carbohydrate (CHO), protein (PRT) and lipid concentration (LIP) were also measured. The chlorophyll- a concentrations highlighted the high degree of oligotrophy of the study site. Moreover, the inorganic fraction of total seston, which exceeded the organic fraction throughout the study period, highlighted the importance of the allochthonous input of suspended particles. Two main phytoplankton abundance peaks were observed, in spring and autumn. These peaks were mirrored by the biochemical composition of the biopolymeric fraction of particulate organic matter (POM, the sum of PRT, CHO and LIP concentrations). The relatively high values of the POC:PON ratio indicated that the major fraction of particulate organic matter in the study area was of detrital origin. A clear dilution effect on the organic matter, caused by high concentrations of suspended inorganic material, was also revealed by the LPOM/TSM ratio, used as a qualitative food index. The mussels were found to activate physiological compensatory mechanisms in order to maintain a constant absorption rate of organic matter from the total available seston. In this case study, the mussels survived in an environment in which the quantities of available food were frequently time-varied. The mussels placed in culture as juveniles (total length=11.20±4.02 mm) reached a length of approximately 40 mm after 12 months, while the mussels placed in culture as sub-adults (total length=43.16±7.5 mm) reached the commercial size of about 60 mm in the same time interval. The sub-adult mussels spawned in autumn and spring, indicating that they acclimatised well, despite the high degree of oligotrophy of the water.
2055217118	MicroRNAs (miRNAs) regulate the translational potential of their mRNA targets and control many cellular processes. The key step in canonical miRNA biogenesis is the cleavage of the primary transcripts by the nuclear RNase III enzyme Drosha. Emerging evidence suggests that the miRNA biogenic cascade is tightly controlled. However, little is known whether Drosha is regulated. Here, we show that Drosha is targeted by stress. Under stress, p38 MAPK directly phosphorylates Drosha at its N terminus. This reduces its interaction with DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene 8 and promotes its nuclear export and degradation by calpain. This regulatory mechanism mediates stress-induced inhibition of Drosha function. Reduction of Drosha sensitizes cells to stress and increases death. In contrast, increase in Drosha attenuates stress-induced death. These findings reveal a critical regulatory mechanism by which stress engages p38 MAPK pathway to destabilize Drosha and inhibit Drosha-mediated cellular survival.
2055217179	Summary  The equine herpes viruses strains (EHV) isolated from organs of aborted foetuses or from nasal swabs have been analysed by comparison of their restriction endonucleases patterns using two enzymes, Bam HI and Pst I. The majority of the clinical samples came from the west part of France (“Normandie”) after abortions or respiratory disorders. All the viruses isolated were EHV-1 strains whose patterns show considerable homogeneity although some differences can be described. The genomic DNAs of the same twenty strains have been digested by the Pst I enzyme, which induced a great number of restriction fragments. It allows a more precise epidemiological study between strains isolated in the same studs with different Bam HI patterns or between strains with identical Bam HI profiles but with distinct respiratory or abortigenic pathogenicity. No strain isolated from aborted foetuses or nasal swabs presented the vaccinal pattern.
2055217182	Abstract Two species of marine actinosporeans with spores that develop in groups of fourrather than eight within a pansporocyst are described. In other respects, including triradialsymmetry, three polar capsules each enclosing a coiled polar filament, parasitic in invertebrates,they conform with other actinosporeans. Both new species were found in the coelom of tubificidoligochaetes collected from Moreton Bay, Queensland, Australia. Spores of Tetrasporadiscoidea n.g. n.sp. are disc-like, almost round in apical view and dorso-ventrallycompressed in side view, whereas spores of Tetraspora rotundum n.sp. are spherical.The novel development of these two marine actinosporeans may signify other variations in thelife-cycles of marine Myxozoa.
2055217188	Chronic ethanol intake is associated with sex hormone disturbances, and it is well known that melatonin plays a key role in regulating several reproductive processes. We report the effects of ethanol intake and melatonin treatment (at doses of 100 μg/100 g BW/day) on sex hormones and steroid receptors in the ovaries, oviducts and uteri of ethanol-preferring rats. After 150 days of treatment, animals were euthanized, and tissue samples were harvested to evaluate androgen, estrogen, progesterone and melatonin receptor subunits (AR, ER-α and ER-β, PRA, PRB and MT1R, respectively). Melatonin decreased estradiol (E2) and increased progesterone (P4) and 6-sulfatoxymelatonin (6-STM), while an ethanol-melatonin combination reduced both P4 and E2. Ovarian AR was not influenced by either treatment, and oviduct AR was reduced after ethanol-melatonin combination. Oviduct ER-α, ER-β and uterine ER-β were down-regulated by either ethanol or melatonin. Conversely, ovarian PRA and PRB were positively regulated by ethanol and ethanol-melatonin combination, whereas PRA was down-regulated in the uterus and oviduct after ethanol consumption. MT1R was increased in ovaries and uteri of melatonin-treated rats. Ethanol and melatonin exert opposite effects on E2 and P4, and they differentially regulate the expression of sex steroid receptors in female reproductive tissues.
2055217209	Experiments are described in which the relative importance of head storage capacity and carbohydrate supply was examined in five sorghum varieties of different heights. The varieties were: Namatera (270 cm), Dobbs (180 cm), MUS 78 (100 cm), MUS 23 (85 cm) and MUS 70 (85 cm). Techniques used were (i) cutting off part of the head or part of the leaf at anthesis, (ii) shading during different periods of development, and (iii) thinning the plants at different physiological stages. Varietal differences ranged from a situation where the head was little more than half-filled by the available carbohydrate (MUS 78), through intermediate stages (Dobbs and Namatera), to a situation where the head capacity limited the amount of carbohydrate which could be stored (MUS 23 and MUS 70). Some differences could be attributed to pre-anthesis competition between head and stem, but in the dwarfs a more important factor appeared to be pre-anthesis competition between head and leaf. It is suggested that for maximum efficiency of grain-yield production, maximum carbohydrate should be utilized for pre-anthesis head and leaf growth and that partitioning between these plant parts should be such that the supply of carbohydrate for grain filling is in balance with head storage capacity.
2055217304	A diallel arrangement, which incorporated the essential features of the de Wit density replacement series, was employed to study the effects of competition amongst five genotypes of perennial ryegrass ( Lolium perenne ). Of the five genotypes concerned two were derived from S·24, two were collected from natural populations in South Wales, while the remaining genotype originated from S· 23. These five genotypes were grown as monocultures and in all ten binary combinations. Within each combination there were three mixture proportions, namely 75:25, 50:50 and 25:75. All mixtures and monocultures were represented by two boxes, one of which was cut at 3-week intervals (frequent cutting) the other being cut at 6-week intervals (infrequent cutting). At each cut all plants within the appropriate mixtures and monocultures were harvested individually and their dry weight recorded. The results obtained over the first 18 weeks of the experiment (i. e. the first three complete growing periods) establish that competition is occurring in nine of the ten binary combinations. Within these nine combinations competition may be classified into one of three groups: first, it may be compensatory, in which the gains and losses incurred by the two components counterbalance; secondly, it may be positive complete complementation, where the advantage gained by the stronger component is such that the mixture performance matches that of the better monoculture, and thirdly, it may be positive over-complementation, where the yield of the better monoculture is surpassed by the mixture. Further tests disclose that a long-leaved S· 24 genotype is the strongest competitor, while a short-leaved, prostrate, indigenous genotype proves to be by far the weakest competitor. Estimates of the equilibrium proportions for each genotype combination suggest that most combinations are expected to become monocultures of the strongest component, with only the combination between the long-leaved indigenous and longleaved S· 23 genotypes remaining a mixture at equilibrium. None of these equilibria coincides with the proportions required to achieve maximum productivity from a particular combination. The results are considered in relation to the known characteristics of these five perennial ryegrass genotypes, while the wider agronomic implications are also discussed.
2055217342	Paperwhite Narcissus of the Tazetta group is one of the most important flower crops in Israel, with more then 20 million bulbs exported annually for both dry sales and flower production. Recent releases by The Volcani Center (Agricultural Research Organization) of cvs. ‘Ariel’ and ‘Inbal’, require adequate protocols for flowering manipulation and extending blooming prior to December and after January, as is common under ambient conditions in Israel. Flowering physiology, including intrabulb flower development, storage, and forcing methods of the new cultivars, were studied in comparison with cv. ‘Ziva’. For September 1 and October 15 planting, bulb storage under ambient conditions (open shed) or at 25 °C was followed by two weeks of chilling at 13 or 9 °C. Post-harvest storage at 25 °C enhanced intrabulb flower differentiation, and pre-planting chilling promoted intrabulb scape elongation, but scapes' final length were shorter then in the control. For January 1 planting, bulbs were kept at 30 °C with a co...
2055217358	Abstract Exposure of arid zone vegetation to repeated moisture stress during the course of life cycle is a common phenomenon. In order to tide over the stress phase, plants make suitable morphological and physiological adaptations. Accumulation of free proline under water deficit is one such physiological response in majority of the add zone plants. Studies on fourteen grasses, eleven annuals and three perennials, reveal a multifold increase in free proline content from stress free to moisture stress conditions, whereas some well adapted grasses show insignificant amount of proline under similar conditions.
2055217375	Conventional treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has apparently reached a plateau of effectiveness in improving the survival of NSCLC patients. Although neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies in early stages are under investigation and some progress has been achieved in the management of locally advanced and advanced disease, treatment outcomes for NSCLC are still to be considered dismal. The majority of patients affected from NSCLC experience metastatic disease and optimization of chemotherapy is unlikely to produce further substantial survival improvement, with symptom relief and quality of life still being the primary goal of treatment. Based on this background, clinical investigation of novel treatment strategies is mandatory. As our understanding of tumor cell biology has increased and several molecular targets for NSCLC have been identified, a number of new biologic agents have been developed. Targeted therapy describes treatment strategies that focus on cell signaling and other biologic pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Several targeted agents have been introduced in clinical trials in NSCLC, the majority in advanced disease, and some phase III studies have already produced definitive results. Currently, the minority of these new agents offer promise of improved outcomes and negative results are more common to be reported than positive ones. However, important lessons can be learned from this first generation of clinical trials that should be considered the first step of clinical research in this field.
2055217382	Previous studies have shown that histone deacetylase 6 (HDAC6) plays critical roles in many cellular processes related to cancer. However, its biological roles in the development of melanoma remain unexplored. Our aim was to investigate whether HDAC6 has a biological role in human melanoma development and to understand its underlying mechanism. In the present study, HDAC6 expression was up-regulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Knockdown of HDAC6 significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation ability of A375.S2 cells, promoted cell arrest at G0/G1 phase and apoptosis. Additionally, western blotting assay showed that HDAC6 silencing suppressed Bcl-2 level and enhanced Bax level, then activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, and further activated the release of cytochrome c from mitochondria to cytoplasm, finally induced cell apoptosis involving the mitochondrial pathway. Knockdown of HDAC6 triggered a significant generation of ROS and disruption of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP). Furthermore, ROS inhibitor, NAC reduced HDAC6 siRNA-induced ROS production, and blocked HDAC6 siRNA-induced loss of MMP and apoptosis. NAC also significantly blocked HDAC6 siRNA-induced mtDNA copy number decrease and mitochondrial biogenesis and degradation imbalance. In conclusion, the results showed that knockdown of HDAC6 induced apoptosis in human melanoma A375.S2 cells through a ROS-dependent mitochondrial pathway.
2055217426	We previously demonstrated that the oral antipsoriatic dimethylfumarate is an inhibitor of cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in endothelial HUVEC cells. We now report the inhibitory effect of dimethylfumarate on tumor-necrosis-factor-α- or interleukin-1α-induced intercellular adhesion molecule 1 expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts. Western blots of normal human dermal fibroblast cytoplasmic extracts showed that dimethylfumarate has minor effects on the IκBα, β and e proteins: their cytokine-induced degradation and resynthesis is only slowed down, an effect most prominently observed for IκBβ. No inhibitory effect of dimethylfumarate was observed on cytokine-induced RelA/p65 or c-Rel accumulation in nuclear extracts of cytokine-treated normal human dermal fibroblast cells. In contrast, cytokine-induced nuclear factor κB1/p50 nuclear accumulation was specifically inhibited by dimethylfumarate. This inhibitory effect on nuclear factor κB1 nuclear localization in normal human dermal fibroblasts proved sufficient to inhibit nuclear factor κB1-RelA binding to nuclear factor κB consensus oligonucleotides in DNA binding assays. Likewise, cytokine-induced activation of a pNFκB::luciferase reporter construct in transiently transfected normal human dermal fibroblasts was inhibited by dimethylfumarate. The observations support a mechanistic model for the oral antipsoriatic dimethylfumarate in which lowering of nuclear factor κB1 leads to changes in the nuclear factor κB1-RelA nuclear balance and inhibition of cytokine-induced adhesion molecule expression in normal human dermal fibroblasts.
2055217493	A cDNA (M41) corresponding to a mouse myelin basic protein (MBP) mRNA with a longer 5'-untranslated region than predicted from earlier studies of MBP gene structure has been isolated and characterized. The additional 5'-untranslated region is encoded by two previously unidentified exons upstream of the major transcription start site of the gene. Using a DNA probe specific for M41-MBP mRNAs, Northern blot analysis indicated that expression of this transcript follows a developmental course in mouse brain similar to that of the majority of MBP mRNAs, but that the level of expression varies between brain and spinal cored. Expression of MBP mRNAs similar to the mouse M41-MBP also was identified in rat brain. The results suggest that the structure of the MBP gene is more complex than originally thought, containing at least two more exons. There appears to be at least one more MBP gene promoter that directs the synthesis of a subset of MBP mRNAs with a unique 5'-untranslated region.
2055217505	Mutant plays an important role in function analysis in plant. A rice flower mutantreproduce organs absent (roa), showing a stable inheritance during several years of study, was identified in rice (Oryza sativa L.ssp. Indica) cultivar Jinhui10 treated with EMS and used in this study. This mutant showed following: elongated palea and pedicle; absence of inner three whorls of floral organs; multi-whorls glume like organs inside the lemma/palea; spikelet meristem like organ upon the pedicle. These phenotypes suggested thatROA is a key gene in rice spikelet development. Genetic analysis confirmed that the mutant traits were controlled by a single recessive nuclear gene. By gene mapping,ROA was restricted between two SSR markers RM221 and RM1342 on the chromosome 2. It concluded thatROA was a novel gene involving in flower development in rice. Besides, the mutation ofROA influenced the transcription level of floral homeotic genes; the expression of floral homeotic genes decreased in roa panicle compared with wild-type, and it suggested thatROA affected flower development by influencing the expression of floral homeotic genes.
2055217521	Abstract Polycytosine-binding proteins (PCBPs) are RNA-binding proteins that participate in post-transcriptional control pathways. Among the diverse functions of these proteins is the interaction with a 27 nucleotide pyrimidine-rich domain within the 3′UTR of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) mRNA. Mutations to this domain result in decreased stability of TH mRNA and loss of cAMP-mediated activation of TH mRNA translation. PCBPs are hypothesized to play key roles in these regulatory mechanisms. In order to further test this hypothesis, we examined the tissue distribution of PCBPs in catecholaminergic cells. Initial studies demonstrated that proteins from catecholaminergic tissues bind to TH mRNA 3′UTR sequences and these proteins have an apparent Mr of ∼44 kDa, which is close to the molecular sizes for PCBPs. Fluorescent immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy was used to analyze the distribution of PCBP isoforms in TH-positive cells of the rat midbrain, locus coeruleus, and adrenal gland. Our results suggest that: (1) PCBP2 is the predominant isoform in TH-positive cells of the rat midbrain; (2) PCBP3 is the predominant isoform in TH-positive cells of the locus coeruleus; and (3) PCBP1 is the predominant isoform in the adrenal medulla. The localization of PCBP proteins to TH-positive cells in these catecholaminergic tissues is consistent with the hypothesis that PCBPs play a role in the regulation of TH expression.
2055217541	An intriguing association between the spatial layout of chromosomes within nuclei and the evolution of chromosome gene order was recently uncovered. Chromosome regions with conserved gene order in the Drosophila genus are larger if they interact with the inner side of the nuclear envelope in D. melanogaster somatic cells. This observation opens a new door to understand the evolution of chromosomes in the light of the dynamics of the spatial layout of chromosomes and the way double-strand breaks are repaired in D. melanogaster germ lines. Chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cell nuclei relocate to more internal locations of male germ line cell nuclei, which might prefer a gene order-preserving mechanism to repair double-strand breaks. Conversely, chromosome regions at the nuclear periphery in somatic cells keep their location in female germ line cell nuclei, which might be inaccessible for cellular machinery that causes gene order-disrupting chromosome rearrangements. Thus, the gene order stability for genome regions at the periphery of somatic cell nuclei might result from the active repair of double-strand breaks using conservative mechanisms in male germ line cells, and the passive inaccessibility for gene order-disrupting factors at the periphery of nuclei of female germ line cells. In the present article, I find evidence consistent with a DNA break repair-based differential contribution of both D. melanogaster germ lines to the stability/disruption of gene order. The importance of germ line differences for the layout of chromosomes and DNA break repair strategies with regard to other genomic patterns is briefly discussed.
2055217546	The family of heavy metal-sequestering peptides with the formula (γ-Glu-Cys)nGly; n = 2–8), the phytochelatins (PCs), are not restricted to higher plants. In Schizosaccharomyces pombe the occurrence of two of these peptides has previously been reported. Reinvestigation of the peptide pattern of the heavy metal-exposed fission yeast led to the discovery of five additional peptides, a pattern which now corresponds qualitatively exactly to the one in higher plants. From the kinetics of induction we propose that PCs are synthesized by consumption of glutathione or its biosynthetic precursor.
2055217556	The human IL-1 family contains eleven genes encoded at three separate loci. Nine, including IL-36 receptor antagonist (IL-36RN), also known as IL-1F5, are present at a single locus on chromosome 2, whereas IL-18 and IL-33 lie on chromosomes 11 and 9 respectively. There are currently only three known orthologues in the chicken - IL-1β, IL-18 and IL-1RN - which are encoded on chromosomes 22, 24 and unplaced, respectively. A novel chicken IL-1 family sequence representing IL-36RN (IL-1F5) was initially identified from an expressed sequence tag (EST) library by its similarity to both chicken IL-1RN and chicken IL-1β. Following isolation of the cDNA from the liver of an uninfected bird, a number of unique sequence features were identified. The predicted protein has a longer NH(2)-terminus than the human protein; however, as in mammals, this region contains neither a prodomain nor a signal peptide. A putative nuclear export sequence is also apparent, yet a similar motif is absent in mammalian IL-36RN. Although chIL-36RN exhibits low homology with its mammalian orthologues, it encodes a predicted β-trefoil structure whose β-strands are conserved with those of the mouse sequence. Unlike in mammals, chIL-36RN expression was constitutive in all tissues and cell subsets examined. In response to viral infection, expression was significantly downregulated in a line of birds which are susceptible to the virus. Chicken IL-36RN, like chIL-1RN, is not encoded at the chIL-1β locus, further emphasising the genomic fragmentation of the large IL-1 gene cluster found in mammals. This suggests differential evolution of this cytokine family since the divergence of birds and mammals from a common ancestor, and underlines the difficulty of determining the full repertoire of chIL-1 family members.
2055217755	Bcl-2 family proteins including the pro-apoptotic BH3-only proteins are central regulators of apoptotic cell death. Here we show by a focused siRNA miniscreen that the synergistic action of the BH3-only proteins Bim and Bmf is required for apoptosis induced by infection with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (Ngo). While Bim and Bmf were associated with the cytoskeleton of healthy cells, they both were released upon Ngo infection. Loss of Bim and Bmf from the cytoskeleton fraction required the activation of Jun-N-terminal kinase-1 (JNK-1), which in turn depended on Rac-1. Depletion and inhibition of Rac-1, JNK-1, Bim, or Bmf prevented the activation of Bak and Bax and the subsequent activation of caspases. Apoptosis could be reconstituted in Bim-depleted and Bmf-depleted cells by additional silencing of antiapoptotic Mcl-1 and Bcl-XL, respectively. Our data indicate a synergistic role for both cytoskeletal-associated BH3-only proteins, Bim, and Bmf, in an apoptotic pathway leading to the clearance of Ngo-infected cells.

2055217816	Several nitrogen compounds were identified and quantified in the apoplastic and symplastic sap of sugarcane stems. The sap of stems was composed mainly of soluble sugars, which constituted 95% of the total organic compounds detected. Sap also contained nitrogen compounds, with amino acids (50-70% of N) and proteins (20-30% of N), being the main nitrogenous substances, as well as inorganic forms as ammonium, nitrite and nitrate, in low concentrations (<20% of N). Serine, proline, alanine and aspartic acid together represented around 60% of the amino acids of the sap of both field grown and high nitrogen fertilized plants, and non-nitrogen fertilized plants inoculated with Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus. The total amino acid content of apoplastic sap was six to nine times lower in non-nitrogen fertilized plants than in fertilized ones. The possible roles of these substances to regulate endophytic associations with sugarcane are also discussed.
2055217860	Cultured arterial smooth muscle cells go through a transition from a contractile to a synthetic phenotype. Morphologically, the transition includes a reduction in size of the myofilament bundles and the formation of an extensive rough endoplasmic reticulum and a large Golgi complex. Functionally, it leads to loss of contractility, onset of cellular proliferation, and secretion of extracellular matrix components. This change in differentiated characteristics under in vitro conditions has attracted attention because of its resemblance to the modification of the smooth muscle cells that occurs in vivo during atherogenesis. Here, transmission electron microscopy and [3H]-thymidine autoradiography were used to study the role of calcium ions in the control of phenotypic properties and growth of cultivated rat aortic smooth muscle cells. The calcium antagonist nisoldipine was found to lack distinct effect on the structural reorganization of the cells, but showed a moderate prohibitory effect on the start of DNA synthesis early in primary culture. In growth-arrested secondary cultures, nisoldipine inhibited induction of DNA synthesis by serum or platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF). The agent's effect was inversely related to the concentration of calcium ions in the extracellular medium and was partially counteracted by the calcium agonist BAY K 8644. In contrast, W-7, an antagonist of the calcium-binding protein calmodulin, potentiated the effect of nisoldipine and, at higher concentrations, inhibited induction of DNA synthesis in itself. The results suggest that the mitogenic stimulation of arterial smooth muscle cells involves a flux of calcium ions through the plasma membrane and requires participation of calmodulin.
2055217922	Abstract This report describes the use of a recombinant yeast expression vector to synthesize and secrete the Mycobacterium leprae 18 kDa antigenic protein. The protein is secreted with a short hydrophilic ‘flag’ octapeptide fused to its amino-terminus. The fusion protein can be purified directly from yeast culture supernatant through an anti-flag antibody affinity column and the flag octapeptide removed using enterokinase. The method provides a simple and rapid means of obtaining recombinant 18 kDa antigen in quantities suitable for immunological studies.
2055217931	Abstract Seasonal changes in the level and composition of nematode burdens in young sheep during their first year were studied in successive lamb crops over a 3‐year period. Post‐mortem worm count data were obtained from groups of 10 lambs slaughtered at 28‐day intervals throughout each of the 3 years. Eighteen nematode species were recorded—14 Strongylidae, 2 Trichinellidae, 1 Metastrongylidae, and 1 Rhabditidae. Seasonal patterns of infection by most species were relatively constant during the period of study. Peak infections of Nematodirus occurred in the spring. Of the principal trichostrongyle species, the patterns of infection by Haemonchus contortus, Ostertagia spp., Trichostrongylus spp. of the small intestine, and Chabertia ovina presented similarities; infections rose rapidly to a peak in late summer/early autumn, followed by an abrupt decline to low numbers in winter. Duration of infection by these species was similar. Infection by Cooperia curticei and T. axei extended over a longer period and...
2055218191	Hairpin RNA-based RNA interference (hpRNAi) has become a powerful tool for exploring gene function in reverse genetics. Although, several methods are available for making constructs that express hpRNAi, multiple time-consuming cloning steps are usually involved. Here, we introduce an efficient and flexible hpRNAi vector construction method via the isothermal in vitro recombination system (IR-hpRNAi). For an IR-hpRNAi reaction, two PCR products of a target gene sequence are generated, which containS complementary ends (~20 bp) to each other and to the ends of linearized vector, are fused in a way of head-to-head or tail-to-tail into the vector. This IR-hpRNAi method offers two options to construct the RNAi vectors. Using this method, we created a IR-hpRNAi construct for the Arabidopsis PDS3 gene,and verified the silencing effect via Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. The IR-hpRNAi system rules out the requirement of engineering restriction enzyme cutting sites in target DNA fragments, and is ligation-independent. Thus, this method has advantages over the other hpRNAi construction methods.
2055218233	Abstract In this study, we analyzed if IL-22 displays, similar to other IL-10 like cytokines such as IL-28A, antiviral properties in hepatic cells. Using RT-PCR and immunoblotting, we demonstrated that hepatic cell lines and primary hepatocytes express the functional IL-22 receptor complex consisting of IL-22R1 and IL-10R2. Hepatic IL-22 mRNA expression as measured by quantitative PCR was up-regulated in autoimmune and viral hepatitis compared to cholestatic liver diseases, while IL-22 serum levels did not differ significantly between patients with viral hepatitis and normal controls. IL-22 did not significantly change the expression levels of IFN-α/-β and of the antiviral proteins MxA and 2′,5′-OAS. Consequently, it had in comparison to IFN-α no relevant antiviral activity in in vitro models of HCV replication and infection. Taken together, hepatic IL-22 expression is up-regulated in viral hepatitis but IL-22 does not directly regulate antiviral proteins and has, in contrast to IFN-α, no effect on HCV replication.
2055218239	A genetic circuit to suppress the lateral spread of cloned genes from recombinant to indigenous microorganisms in the environment has been developed. It is based on the endonucleolytic activity of the bacterial toxin colicin E3, which has a distinct target at the 3' end of the 16S ribosomal RNA; this sequence is conserved in virtually all prokaryotic and many eukaryotic genera. Cleavage at this sequence separates the mRNA binding sites from the remainder of the 16S rRNA, thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. While host bacteria carrying the genes for both colicin production and colicin immunity are perfectly viable, lateral transfer of the E3 gene to non-immune recipients results in killing of such recipients. This genetic circuit decreases operational transfer frequencies of cloned genes linked to the E3 gene among a variety of bacterial genera by four to five orders of magnitude. In combination with transposon cloning vectors, the circuit is predicted to reduce the rate of lateral spread of specific genes to ecologically insignificant levels. This system therefore represents a useful tool both to explore the evolutionary and ecological consequences of experimentally reducing lateral gene spread among microorganisms, and to increase the ecological predictability of novel recombinant microorganisms.
2055218272	IgG subclasses were determined quantitatively in sera from 63 Egyptian men who were infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Total and antigen-specific IgG was measured pre- and post-treatment. Total IgG subclass antibodies were determined by immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) using monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs). The anti-worm and anti-egg specific S. mansoni IgG subclass antibodies were quantitatively measured by ELISA using specific MoAbs and standards obtained by affinity chromatography. Our data show that total IgG of the patients was elevated in the range of two to three times above normal. The magnitude of increase differed markedly among the four subclasses of IgG. The IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3 concentrations were approximately two to four times higher than normal, whereas the IgG4 concentrations was 20 times normal (9000 mg/l). IgG1 and IgG4 tended to dominate the IgG subclass distribution of anti-soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP) antibodies followed by IgG2 and IgG3. On the other hand, IgG1 and IgG2 dominated the IgG subclass distribution of anti-soluble egg antigen (SEA) antibodies. As with IgG1, IgG2 and IgG3, most IgG4 was non-specific. The role of IgG subclasses in the pathogenesis of schistosomiasis is not clear. However, the high concentration of IgG4 might act as IgE blocking antibody, possibly as anti-idiotypes that may play a role in down-regulation of the immune system when it is challenged with an excess of antigen.
2055218347	Genetic selection provides an effective way to obtain active catalysts from a diverse population of protein variants. We have used this tool to investigate the role of loop sequences in determining the quaternary structure of a domain-swapped enzyme. By inserting random loops of four to seven residues into a dimeric chorismate mutase and selecting for functional variants by genetic complementation, we have obtained and characterized both monomeric and hexameric enzymes that retain considerable catalytic activity. The low percentage of active proteins recovered from these selection experiments indicates that relatively few loop sequences permit a change in quaternary structure without affecting active site structure. The results of our experiments suggest further that protein stability can be an important driving force in the evolution of oligomeric proteins.
2055218376	Background: Panax ginseng C. A. Meyer, a perennial herb from the Araliaceae family, is a commonly used medicinal plant. Many studies have been conducted on the biologically active constituents of whole parts of P. ginseng (i.e., roots, leaves, flower buds, and fruits). However, the seeds of P. ginseng have not been intensively investigated. A new sterol glucoside,3-O-β-d-glucopyranosyl-5,22,24-stigmastatrienol ( 1 ), and a known sterol, 5,22-stigmastadienol ( 2 ),were isolated from seeds of P. ginsengand were evaluated for their inhibitory activities on tumor necrosis factor (TNF)α-induced nuclear factor (NF)-κB and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) transcription in transfected HepG2 cells. The present work deals with the isolation, identification, and antiinflammatory activities of the two compounds. Materials and Methods: The compounds were isolated by a combination of silica gel and YMC R-18 column chromatography, and their structures were identified by analysis of spectroscopic data (1D, 2D-NMR, and MS).The antiinflammatory activities of the isolated compounds 1 and 2 were evaluated by luciferase reporter gene assays. Results: Two sterols have been isolated from the seeds of P. ginseng. Compound 1 is a previously unreported glucosidyl sterol. Compounds 1 and 2 both inhibited NFκB-luciferase activity, with IC 50 values of 8.1 and 4.8΅M, respectively. They also inhibited iNOS-luciferase activity in TNFα-induced HepG2 cells, with IC 50 values of 2.2 and 2.9΅M, respectively. Conclusion: The two isolatedsterols have inhibitory effects on inflammation-related factors in HepG2 cells, as determined by luciferase reporter gene assays. Thus, seeds of P. ginseng are worthy of consideration for the development and research of antiinflammatory agents.
2055218387	Premetamorphic flounder larvae were administered different doses of 9-cis retinoic acid (9cRA). 9cRA at 25 nM (the highest dose) not only stimulated adult-type (ad-) chromatophore development on the ocular (eyed) side, but also induced the development of ad-chromatophores on the blind (non-eyed) side of the metamorphosed fish. The ad-chromatophore development was stimulated by 9cRA only when administered to the larvae that were at late premetamorphosis and at early prometamorphosis. Ad-chromatophores actually appear much later, at the end of metamorphosis. 9cRA was not effective at later stages of metamorphosis. These results suggest that 9cRA stimulated the development or determination of the developmental fate of neural crest cells for chromatophores. The present results also suggest the presence of immature chromatophores or neural crest cells on both sides of the larval body of the flounder and that the ad-chromatophore development is somehow inhibited on the blind side in spontaneous metamorphosis. All-trans retinoic acid (atRA) had a similar effect on the ad-chromatophore development. In addition, both types of RAs affected the development of fin rays of the fish, resulting in deformity of fins when administered at high doses early in metamorphosis. The teratogenic effect of atRA was greater than that of 9cRA. J. Exp. Zool. 284:317–324, 1999. © 1999 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
2055218413	Myristicin, a methylenedioxyphenyl (MDP)-containing phenylpropene constituent of the leaves of many plants in the family Umbelliferae, is a highly effective Synergist of the cooccurring furanocoumarin xanthotoxin. As little as 0.10 % in an artificial diet can increase the toxicity of xanthotoxin toHeliothis zea (Lepidotera: Noctuidae) fivefold. In addition to increasing the proportion of caterpillars dying at a given xanthotoxin concentration, myristicin also increases the rate at which they die and increases the time to molt of surviving larvae. That there was no increase in the deterrency of xanthotoxin in the presence of myristicin suggests that the mechanism of synergism is not behaviorial but rather is biochemical, via MDP competitive inhibition of microsomal mixed function oxidases.
2055218425	Mutations in human cationic trypsinogen cause hereditary pancreatitis by altering its proteolytic regulation of activation and degradation by chymotrypsin C (CTRC). CTRC stimulates trypsinogen autoactivation by processing the activation peptide to a shorter form, but also promotes degradation by cleaving the calcium-binding loop in trypsinogen. Mutations render trypsinogen resistant to CTRC-mediated degradation and/or increase processing of the activation peptide by CTRC. Here we demonstrate that the activation peptide mutations D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK robustly increased the rate of trypsinogen autoactivation, both in the presence and absence of CTRC. Degradation of the mutants by CTRC was unchanged, and processing of the activation peptide was increased fourfold in the D19A mutant only. Surprisingly, however, this increased processing had only a minimal effect on autoactivation. The tetra-aspartate motif in the trypsinogen activation peptide binds calcium (KD of ~ 1.6 mM), which stimulates autoactivation. Unexpectedly, calcium binding was not compromised by any of the activation peptide mutations. Despite normal binding, autoactivation of mutants D22G and K23_I24insIDK was not stimulated by calcium. Finally, the activation peptide mutants exhibited reduced secretion from transfected cells, and secreted trypsinogen levels were inversely proportional with autoactivation rates. We conclude that D19A, D22G, K23R and K23_I24insIDK form a mechanistically distinct subset of hereditary pancreatitis-associated mutations that exert their effect primarily through direct stimulation of autoactivation, independently of CTRC. The potentially severe clinical impact of the markedly increased autoactivation is offset by diminished secretion, resulting in a clinical phenotype that is indistinguishable from typical hereditary pancreatitis.
2055218440	Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are pentameric ligand-gated cation channels well characterized in neuronal signal transmission. Moreover, recent studies have revealed nAChR expression in nonneuronal cell types throughout the body, including tissues involved in metabolism. In the present study, we screen gene expression of nAChR subunits in pancreatic islets and adipose tissues. Mice pancreatic islets present predominant expression of α7 and β2 nAChR subunits but at a lower level than in central structures. Characterization of glucose and energy homeostasis in α7β2nAChR(-/-) mice revealed no major defect in insulin secretion and sensitivity but decreased glycemia apparently unrelated to gluconeogenesis or glycogenolysis. α7β2nAChR(-/-) mice presented an increase in lean and bone body mass and a decrease in fat storage with normal body weight. These observations were associated with elevated spontaneous physical activity in α7β2nAChR(-/-) mice, mainly due to elevation in fine vertical (rearing) activity while their horizontal (ambulatory) activity remained unchanged. In contrast to α7nAChR(-/-) mice presenting glucose intolerance and insulin resistance associated to excessive inflammation of adipose tissue, the present metabolic phenotyping of α7β2nAChR(-/-) mice revealed a metabolic improvement possibly linked to the increase in spontaneous physical activity related to central β2nAChR deficiency.
2055218518	The Mucorales consist of both homothallic and heterothallic species. Both types can be found in the same species but this is not a common phenomenon. A few homothallic strains are found in the predominantly heterothallic species, Mucor pusillus . It was interesting to see how readily homothallic mutants could be induced in this species. Spores of CBS 253.53(+) were irradiated with gamma rays. Homothallic and (−) mutants were isolated. An albino (+) and a yellowish-brown (+) mutant were also found. The two pigment mutants were further mutated, and again both (−) and homothallic mutants were isolated. Morphological characteristics of M. pusillus such as branching of sporangiophores, size of sporangia, and height of turf are retained by the mutants. The only obvious change is the color of the pigment of some of them. Like the original strain, they grow in the absence of thiamine. The development, structure, and size of the zygospores are typical of M. pusillus . The dark pigment of the zygospores is lacking in the albino homothallic and in crosses between albino (+) and albino (−), but in all other cases the characteristic color is retained. Homothallic mutants which otherwise are identical to their parent are readily induced by mutation of a heterothallic strain. The mere presence or absence of zygospores cannot be used as a classification criterion in this species which contains both hetero- and homothallic members.
2055218521	Os Scarabaeidae consomem fezes e carcacas de grandes vertebrados. Comunidades de escarabeideos foram comparadas entre areas de Mata e Tabuleiro da Reserva Biologica Guaribas, Mamanguape, Paraiba. As amostragens foram realizadas mensalmente durante o periodo de Novembro/2001 a Abril/2002 em areas de Tabuleiro e Mata. Para coleta dos insetos foram utilizadas 24 armadilhas pitfall iscadas, 12 em cada area, sendo seis iscadas com fezes humanas e seis com figado apodrecido. Na area de Mata foram coletados 15 especies e 1298 individuos. Na area de Tabuleiro, 25 especies e 2235 individuos. Onze especies ocorrem conjuntamente nos dois ambientes, sendo 14 registradas apenas para o Tabuleiro e 4 para a Mata. Dichotomius sericeus (Harold, 1867) foi a especie mais abundante nas duas areas. A area de Tabuleiro apresentou maior riqueza, entretanto a Mata apresentou maior dominância. O compartilhamento de especies comuns entre a Mata e o Tabuleiro confere a estes ambientes similaridade moderada.
2055218656	Background  N-glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc) is generated by hydroxylation of CMP-Neu5Ac to CMP-Neu5Gc, catalyzed by CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (CMAH). However, humans lack this common mammalian cell surface molecule, Neu5Gc, due to inactivation of the CMAH gene during evolution. CMAH is one of several human-specific genes whose function has been lost by disruption or deletion of the coding frame. It has been suggested that CMAH inactivation has resulted in biochemical or physiological characteristics that have resulted in human-specific diseases. Methodology/Principal Findings  To identify differential gene expression profiles associated with the loss of Neu5Gc expression, we performed microarray analysis using Illumina MouseRef-8 v2 Expression BeadChip, using the main tissues (lung, kidney, and heart) from control mice and CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase (Cmah) gene knock-out mice, respectively. Out of a total of 25,697 genes, 204, 162, and 147 genes were found to be significantly modulated in the lung, kidney, and heart tissues of the Cmah null mouse, respectively. In this study, we examined the gene expression profiles, using three commercial pathway analysis software packages: Ingenuity Pathways Analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analysis, and Pathway Studio. The gene ontology analysis revealed that the top 6 biological processes of these genes included protein metabolism and modification, signal transduction, lipid, fatty acid, and steroid metabolism, nucleoside, nucleotide and nucleic acid metabolism, immunity and defense, and carbohydrate metabolism. Gene interaction network analysis showed a common network that was common to the different tissues of the Cmah null mouse. However, the expression of most sialytransferase mRNAs of Hanganutziu-Deicher antigen, sialy-Tn antigen, Forssman antigen, and Tn antigen was significantly down-regulated in the liver tissue of Cmah null mice. Conclusions/Significance  Mice bearing a human-like deletion of the Cmah gene serve as an important model for the study of abnormal pathogenesis and/or metabolism caused by the evolutionary loss of Neu5Gc synthesis in humans.
2055218717	Background/Aims The aim of this study was to investigate the effect and the mechanism of hyperbaric oxygen treatment on regenerating rat liver after partial hepatectomy (PH). Methods Wistar rats underwent a 70% PH, followed by treatment with hyperbaric oxygen starting 8h after PH. The regenerated liver weight and serum parameters were compared. Proliferation of both hepatocytes and sinusoidal endothelial cell (SEC) was also monitored by evaluating the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) labeling index. Furthermore, the hepatic adenosine triphosphate levels and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) protein expression were analyzed at different times. Results Hyperbaric oxygen treatment significantly reduced the serum alanine aminotransferase levels at 24h, total bilirubin and total bile acid levels at 48 and 72h, respectively. No significant differences in the hepatic adenosine triphosphate levels, the restitution of liver weight, or PCNA positive hepatocytes were observed between the two groups. The PCNA positive SEC, in contrast, was significantly increased in the hyperbaric oxygen group at 48h, furthermore, the hyperbaric oxygen treatment significantly increased the expression of VEGF protein in the regenerating liver at 24 and 48h. Conclusions Hyperbaric oxygen treatment can be considered as a therapeutic modality after massive PH.
2055218751	Abstract Platelet-derived endothelial cell growth factor was previously identified as the sole angiogenic activity present in platelets; it is now known to be thymidine phosphorylase (TP). The effect of TP on [methyl-3H]thymidine uptake does not arise from de novo DNA synthesis and the molecule is not a growth factor. Despite this, TP is strongly angiogenic in a rat sponge and freeze-injured skin graft model. Neutralizing antibodies and site-directed mutagenesis confirmed that the enzyme activity of TP is a condition for its angiogenic activity. The level of TP was found to be elevated in human breast tumors compared to normal breast tissue (P < 0.001). Overexpression of TP in MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells had no effect on growth in vitro but markedly enhanced tumor growth in vivo. These data and the correlation of expression in tumors with malignancy identify TP as a target for antitumor strategies.
2055218782	The aromatic amino acid L-tyrosine is used as a dietary supplement and has promise as a valuable precursor compound for various industrial and pharmaceutical applications. In contrast to chemical production, biotechnological methods can produce L-tyrosine from biomass feedstocks under environmentally friendly and near carbon-free conditions. In this minireview, various strategies for synthesizing L-tyrosine by employing biocatalysts are discussed, including initial approaches as well as more recent advances. Whereas early attempts to engineer L-tyrosine-excreting microbes were based on auxotrophic and antimetabolite-resistant mutants, recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid technology and a vastly increasing knowledge of bacterial physiology allowed recently for more targeted genetic manipulations and strain improvements. As an alternative route, L-tyrosine can also be obtained from the conversion of phenol, pyruvate, and ammonia or phenol and serine in reactions catalyzed by the enzyme tyrosine phenol lyase.
2055218819	Abstract Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a potent mitogen of many cell types and plays an important role in angiogenesis. To help identify proteins that bind to bFGF and mediate its intracellular transport and signaling, we overexpressed and purified a bFGF fusion protein in Escherichia coli . The fusion protein consists of bFGF fused to the C-terminus of glutathione S -transferase (GST). The GST-bFGF fusion protein was purified using SP-Sepharose and glutathione–Sepharose affinity chromatography. The ability of the purified GST-bFGF to stimulate the growth of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) was equivalent to that of purified recombinant 18 kDa bFGF.
2055218893	Ranges of trapping devices were investigated for their ability to sample predatory mites and insects on branches of apple trees. Straw traps caught significantly more predatory mites whereas corrugated cardboard traps proved better for larger predators such as the common earwig, Forficula auricularia. The most abundant predatory species sampled on the trees was the 'whirli-gig' mite Anystis baccarum. The efficiency of the various trapping devices and the potential of incorporating A. baccarum within environmentally based management strategies for invertebrate pest control within the Bramley apple orchards are discussed.
2055218918	Abstract The COOH-terminal cyclic eicosapeptide of human growth hormone, Lys-Val-Glu-Thr-Phe-Leu-Arg-Ile-Val-Gln-Cys-Arg-Val-Ser-Glu-Gly-Ser-Cys-Gly-Phe, was synthesized by the solid phase methodology. The synthetic peptide was assayed and found to possess significant hyperglycaemic activity in normal rats.
2055219036	Glia in the brain respond to various toxins with an increased expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and an increased production of nitric oxide (NO). Here, we report that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of iNOS was down-regulated post-transcriptionally through the destabilization of iNOS mRNA by the indolocarbazole compound, Go6976, in murine microglia. This Go6976 effect is specific for iNOS since tumor necrosis factor α was unaffected by the compound. Interestingly, the post-transcriptional effects ascribed to Go6976 were not observed with other inhibitors of protein kinase A, C (PKC), G, or protein tyrosine kinases. Instead, these kinases appear to affect the iNOS/NO system at the transcriptional level. In the past, Go6976 has been reported to be a rather specific inhibitor of PKC in vitro. Results from our experiments, through prolonged treatment with phorbol esters and with the various PKC inhibitors including phorbol ester-insensitive PKC isotype inhibitor, suggest that the Go6976-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of iNOS gene expression and NO production in microglia is not mediated through its reputed effects on PKC activity. Since the effects of various neurotoxins and certain neurodegenerative diseases may be manifested through alterations in the iNOS/NO system, post-transcriptional control of this system may represent a novel strategy for therapeutic intervention.
2055219048	The sponge Eunapius fragilis (Leidy), that has become abundant in southwestern Lake Michigan, overgrows zebra mussels, Dreissena polymorpha (Pallas). The overgrown mussels die. Population dynamics show that in the presence of zebra mussels, E. fragilis is the dominant species (61% of sponges), with 90% of these sponges being associated directly to the mussels. In vivo 31 P NMR spectroscopy performed on overgrown mussels reveals that mussel ATP is depleted in a manner indicative of a tissue in anoxia (Figure 2). 31 P NMR phospholipid profiles reveal that the phospholipids of such mussels have been degraded to their lyso-phospholipid forms. Phospholipid degradation may be the direct result of the lysosomal chemical action of the sponge or a secondary effect resulting from sponge-induced death by anoxia followed by microbial action on the weakened energy-depleted mussels.
2055219071	Chemical studies on the constituents of Dracaena cochinchinensis led to the discovery of eight new flavonoid derivatives ( 1- 8) along with 14 known compounds ( 9- 22). The identification and structural elucidation of these isolates were based on spectral analyses. All isolates were tested for antibacterial activities against Helicobacter pylori (ATCC43504) and thrombin inhibitory effects. As a result, new flavonoid derivatives 6 and 7 and (2 S)-4',7-dihydroxy-8-methylflavan ( 11) were found to be most efficacious against H. pylori (ATCC43504) with MIC values of 29.5, 29.5, and 31.3 microM, respectively, and the seven new flavonoid derivatives ( 1- 7) and one known biflavonoid ( 9) were observed to exhibit moderate thrombin inhibitory activity.

2055219121	Kit ligand (KL), a product of granulosa cells in ovarian follicles, is a putative regulator of oocyte development. However, the factors that regulate KL mRNA levels in granulosa cells remain unclear. This study tested the hypothesis that oocytes regulate granulosa cell steady-state KL mRNA expression levels and that the characteristics of this regulation are dependent on the stage of growth and development of both oocytes and follicles. Levels of mRNA for the KL splice variants (KL-1 and KL-2) were shown to be high in granulosa cells from preantral follicles and then decline after follicular antrum formation. Preovulatory follicular development was associated with a dramatic increase in steady-state levels of KL-1 mRNA in mural granulosa but not cumulus cells. Regulation of these changes was examined in vitro using partly grown oocytes isolated from preantral follicles and fully grown oocytes isolated from preovulatory follicles. FSH increased the steady-state KL mRNA levels in preantral granulosa cells in vitro. Partly grown oocytes either increased or decreased KL mRNA levels in preantral granulosa cells depending on the absence or presence of FSH stimulation, respectively. Fully grown oocytes reduced the KL mRNA level in preantral granulosa cells and increased the ratio of KL-1 to KL-2 mRNA. In mural granulosa cell culture, FSH augmented testosterone-dependent elevation of the steady-state KL mRNA level, but had no effect alone. Fully grown oocytes reduced KL-2 but not KL-1 mRNA levels in mural granulosa cells treated with testosterone plus FSH, whereas fully grown oocytes reduced levels of both KL transcripts in cumulus cell culture. These effects of oocytes on steady-state KL mRNA expression levels in vitro explain the changes in granulosa cell KL mRNA levels observed during follicle development in vivo. The results therefore support the hypothesis that oocytes regulate granulosa cell kit ligand mRNA levels in a way that is characteristic of the stage of growth and development of the oocyte. Moreover, the results suggest that oocytes play a major role in promoting dynamic changes in gene expression by granulosa cells appropriate to the stage of follicular development.
2055219145	We observe that Paracentrotus lividus RNA polymerase II can form stable complexes with homologous DNA at sites from which it can start RNA synthesis in vitro. The sea-urchin genome can therefore be described in terms of the distribution of the DNA sites that form such stable complexes with the homologous RNA polymerase II [class A sites as defined in a prokaryotic homologous system by D. Hinkle and M. J. Chamberlin (1972) J. Mol. Biol. 70, 157-185].    We describe the properties of the complexes that P. lividus RNA polymerase II forms with P. lividus DNA: resistance to heparin, dissociation kinetics, temperature and time dependence of their formation, range of RNA polymerase/DNA weight/weight ratios that give rise to the stable binding events.    The amount and the distibution of the sites that form stable complexes with P. lividus RNA polymerase II were determined by the analysis of the dissociation of the complexes formed by the enzyme on DNA fragments of various lengths.    P. lividus appears to form 4.5 × 104 stable (t1/2≥ 30 min) complexes/haploid genome. A part of these complexes has a distribution corresponding to values between 2000 and 4500 base pairs; the rest of the complexes is more widely spaced (up to a measured interval of 30000 base pairs).
2055219171	Background: The Western diet increases risk of metabolic disease.  Objective: We determined whether lowering the ratio of saturated fatty acids to monounsaturated fatty acids in the Western diet would affect physical activity and energy expenditure.  Design: With the use of a balanced design, 2 cohorts of 18 and 14 young adults were enrolled in separate randomized, double-masked, crossover trials that compared a 3-wk high–palmitic acid diet (HPA; similar to the Western diet fat composition) to a low–palmitic acid and high–oleic acid diet (HOA; similar to the Mediterranean diet fat composition). All foods were provided by the investigators, and the palmitic acid (PA):oleic acid (OA) ratio was manipulated by adding different oil blends to the same foods. In both cohorts, we assessed physical activity (monitored continuously by using accelerometry) and resting energy expenditure (REE). To gain insight into a possible mood disturbance that might explain changes in physical activity, the Profile of Mood States (POMS) was administered in cohort 2.  Results: Physical activity was higher during the HOA than during the HPA in 15 of 17 subjects in cohort 1 (P = 0.008) (mean: 12% higher; P = 0.003) and in 12 of 12 subjects in the second, confirmatory cohort (P = 0.005) (mean: 15% higher; P = 0.003). When the HOA was compared with the HPA, REE measured during the fed state was 3% higher for cohort 1 (P < 0.01), and REE was 4.5% higher in the fasted state for cohort 2 (P = 0.04). POMS testing showed that the anger-hostility score was significantly higher during the HPA (P = 0.007).  Conclusions: The replacement of dietary PA with OA was associated with increased physical activity and REE and less anger. Besides presumed effects on mitochondrial function (increased REE), the dietary PA:OA ratio appears to affect behavior. The second cohort was derived from a study that was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as R01DK082803.
2055219185	Objective: This study was designed to determine whether regulatory regions p250 of c-fos gene were responsive to SeO2 and to seek the possible mechanisms of regulation. Methods: HeLa cells were transfected with plasmids p250-tk CAT containing upstream regulating regions of c-fos gene. Cells were treated by SeO2 for 20 min. CAT expression in transfected cells was observed by thin layered chromatography. Results: In transfected HeLa cells CAT expression showed obvious increase after exposure to SeO2, especially in 10 µmol/L and 30 µmol/L group (P<0.05). Conclusion: Through affecting regulatory regions p250 of c-fos gene, SeO2 exerted biological effect on tumor cells. SeO2 possibly had anti-tumor effects.
2055219248	During pregnancy, disorders in uterine spiral artery remodeling (USAR) cause preeclampsia and other diseases. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (20-HETE) on the biological behavior of human villous trophoblasts (HVTs) and human uterine vascular smooth muscle cells (HUVSMCs), and explore the role of 20-HETE in USAR. 20-HETE and its inhibitor HET0016 were used to study migration, invasion and apoptosis in the HVT and HVT-HUVSMC models. 20-HETE inhibited the migration and invasion of HVTs, and inhibited apoptosis in HUVSMCs and HUVSMCs co-cultured with HVTs. 20-HETE had thus obvious effects on the biological behavior of HVTs and HUVSMCs. These effects may cause USAR disorders and vascular dysfunction, leading to preeclampsia.
2055219298	Alimentary and endogenous proteins are mixed in the small intestinal lumen with the microbiota. Although experimental evidences suggest that the intestinal microbiota is able to incorporate and degrade some of the available amino acids, it appears that the microbiota is also able to synthesize amino acids raising the view that amino acid exchange between the microbiota and host can proceed in both directions. Although the net result of such exchanges remains to be determined, it is likely that a significant part of the amino acids recovered from the alimentary proteins are used by the microbiota. In the large intestine, where the density of bacteria is much higher than in the small intestine and the transit time much longer, the residual undigested luminal proteins and peptides can be degraded in amino acids by the microbiota. These amino acids cannot be absorbed to a significant extent by the colonic epithelium, but are precursors for the synthesis of numerous metabolic end products in reactions made by the microbiota. Among these products, some like short-chain fatty acids and organic acids are energy substrates for the colonic mucosa and several peripheral tissues while others like sulfide and ammonia can affect the energy metabolism of colonic epithelial cells. More work is needed to clarify the overall effects of the intestinal microbiota on nitrogenous compound metabolism and consequences on gut and more generally host health.
2055219345	Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) was used for hop varietal identification, primarily to distinguish Tsingtaodahua, a fine Chinese variety. Eleven typical varieties, including four aroma hops, five bitter hops, Tsingtaodahua and Cluster, were successfully identified on the basis of 28 polymorphic RAPD bands amplified by five random primers. UPGMA analysis of RAPD data showed genetic relationship among analyzed varieties consistent with traditional hop classification. Subsequently, one specific RAPD fragment was converted to a sequence tagged site (STS) marker which can detect as little as a 5% admixture of the variety Kirin 1 in Tsingtaodahua. The RAPD and STS markers can be successfully used for Tsingtaodahua identification and quality control.
2055219350	SUMMARY Data on the dynamics of craniofacial growth, obtained by simple non-invasive measurements, are scarce in comparison with those collected by cephalometric methods. The aim of this study was to measure a number of craniofacial parameters, and to evaluate their changes during transition from the deciduous to the permanent dentition. A sample of 61 subjects (32 boys and 29 girls) were followed longitudinally by annual examination from an initial mean age of 4.7 years to a final mean age of 11.8 years. Conventional anthropometric instruments were employed to measure six craniofacial variables: G-Op, Eu-Eu, Zy-Zy, Go-Go, N-Gn and N-Pr. The data were analysed using basic summary statistics and a longitudinal regression model. A difference between males and females was found for all variables during the study period. During the transition from deciduous to mixed dentition (4.7-7.5 years), the cranial breadth and length (Eu-Eu and G-Op) decreased followed by an increase during the mixed dentition. All other parameters showed a continuous increase, which was highest for the variables defining facial height.
2055219351	A 58-year-old woman living in Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan, complained of severe epigastric pain and nausea about 8 h after having eaten 'Sashimi'. A gastrocamera examination undertaken as a result of her clinical history of gastric anisakiasis indicated that a large number of worms had penetrated the posterior walls. Fifty-six larval nematodes were directly removed from the greater curvature of the stomach with a gastroendoscopic biopsy clipper, and were identified as the larvae of Anisakis simplex.
2055219365	We verify the levels of cytokine/chemokine, myeloperoxidase activity, oxidative stress and disruption of BBB in hippocampus and cortex of the neonate Wistar rats after meningitis by S. agalactiae. In the hippocampus the levels were increased of CINC-1 at 6 h and 12 h, IL-1β at 6, 12 and 24 h, IL-6 at 6, 24 and 96 h, IL-10 at 24, 48 and 96 h and TNF-α at 24 h and 96 h. In the cortex the CINC-1 and IL-1β levels were found increased at 6 h. The MPO activity was significantly elevated at 24, 48 and 98 h in hippocampus and at 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h in the cortex. The breakdown of BBB started at 12 h.TBARS levels were elevated in the hippocampus at 6, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h and cortex at 72 and 96 h. Protein carbonyls were elevated in the hippocampus and cortex at 6, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h. There was a decrease of SOD activity in hippocampus and in cortex. Catalase activity was elevated in hippocampus at 6 h and in the cortex at 12 and 96 h. Neonatal bacterial infections of the CNS are severe, the interference with the complex network of cytokines/chemokine, other inflammatory mediators and oxidants tend to aggravate the illness and can be involved in the breakdown of the BBB.
2055219379	The recently described gene, RAB32, is a ras proto-oncogene family member that encodes an A-kinase-anchoring protein. RAB32 has been found to be frequently hypermethylated in microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colon cancers. We sought to determine the prevalence of RAB32 hypermethylation in gastric and endometrial adenocarcinomas, the 2 other major tumor types in which MSI-H is common. Moreover, we delineated the association of RAB32 hypermethylation with microsatellite instability (MSI) and hMLH1 hypermethylation. MSI status and hypermethylation of the RAB32 and hMLH1 genes were studied in paired primary normal and tumor tissues from 48 patients with gastric cancer. An additional 80 endometrial cancer patients were studied for RAB32 methylation and MSI status. Thirteen (27%) of 48 gastric cancers demonstrated evidence of RAB32 hypermethylation. MSI status was determined in 46 of the tumors, with 7 (100%) of 7 MSI-H tumors, 1 (33%) of 3 MSI-low (MSI-L) tumors and 4 (11%) of 36 microsatellite-stable (MSS) tumors found to harbor RAB32 hypermethylation. RAB32 methylation was significantly associated with intestinal type histology and concomitant hMLH1 hypermethylation in gastric cancer. In contrast, RAB32 methylation occurred in only 1 of 80 endometrial cancers, including 20 MSI-H, 8 MSI-L and 52 MSS tumors. Hypermethylation of hMLH1 was noted in 16 (20%) of 80 endometrial tumors. We conclude that although RAB32 methylation is rare in endometrial cancers, it is strongly associated with hMLH1 hypermethylation and MSI in gastric adenocarcinomas. Given its similar involvement in colon cancer, RAB32 inactivation may represent a component of the oncogenic pathway of microsatellite-unstable gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas.
2055219417	A protocol has been developed for in vitro clonal propagation leading to conservation of Bacopa monnieri (L) Wettst, a medicinal plant of high commercial potential with legendary reputation as a memory vitalizer. Single node explants when cultured on Murashige and Skoog’s medium supplemented with BA (0.2 mg l-1), showed active shoot proliferation (22.2 shoots/ explant in 8 weeks) without callus formation. Rooting was achieved on the same medium. The generated shoots could also be conserved for 12 months with high survival rate (up to 100%). The regenerants upon transfer to soil showed no morphological variation as compared with the donor plants. The medium optimized in the present study was applied for culture establishment and conservation of a total of 15 Brahmi accessions procured from different regions.
2055219455	Clinical and experimental biomedical studies have shown Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to be a risk factor for the development of Alzheimer's disease (AD). This study demonstrates the effect of metformin, a therapeutic biguanide administered for T2DM therapy, on β-amyloid precursor protein (APP) metabolism in in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo models. Furthermore, the protective role of insulin against metformin is also demonstrated. In LAN5 neuroblastoma cells, metformin increases APP and presenilin levels, proteins involved in AD. Overexpression of APP and presenilin 1 (Pres 1) increases APP cleavage and intracellular accumulation of β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), which, in turn, promotes aggregation of Aβ. In the experimental conditions utilized the drug causes oxidative stress, mitochondrial damage, decrease of Hexokinase-II levels and cytochrome C release, all of which lead to cell death. Several changes in oxidative stress-related genes following metformin treatment were detected by PCR arrays specific for the oxidative stress pathway. These effects of metformin were found to be antagonized by the addition of insulin, which reduced Aβ levels, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction and cell death. Similarly, antioxidant molecules, such as ferulic acid and curcumin, are able to revert metformin's effect. Comparable results were obtained using peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Finally, the involvement of NF-κB transcription factor in regulating APP and Pres 1 expression was investigated. Upon metformin treatment, NF-κB is activated and translocates from the cytoplasm to the nucleus, where it induces increased APP and Pres 1 transcription. The use of Bay11-7085 inhibitor suppressed the effect of metformin on APP and Pres 1 expression.
2055219457	Primary leaves of oats (Avena sativa L.) have been used to study the integration of secondary phenolic metabolism into organ differentiation and development. In particular, the tissue-specific distribution of products and enzymes involved in their biosynthesis has been investigated. C-Glucosylflavones along with minor amounts of hydroxycinnamic-acid esters constitute the soluble phenolic compounds in these leaves. In addition, considerable amounts of insoluble products such as lignin and wall-bound ferulic-acid esters are formed. The tissue-specific activities of seven enzymes were determined in different stages of leaf growth. The rate-limiting enzyme of flavonoid biosynthesis in this system, chalcone synthase, together with chalcone isomerase (EC 5.5.1.6) and the terminal enzymes of the vitexin and isovitexin branches of the pathway (a flavonoid O-methyltransferase and an isovitexin arabinosyltransferase) are located in the leaf mesophyll. Since the flavonoids accumulate predominantly (up to 70%) in both epidermal layers, an intercellular transport of products is postulated. In contrast to the flavonoid enzymes, L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (EC 4.3.1.5), 4-coumarate: CoA ligase (EC 6.2.1.12), and S-adenosyl-L-methionine: caffeate 3-O-methyltransferase (EC 2.1.1.-), all involved in general phenylpropanoid metabolism, showed highest activities in the basal leaf region as well as in the epidermis and the vascular bundles. We suggest that these latter enzymes participate mainly in the biosynthesis of non-flavonoid phenolic products, such as lignin in the xylem tissue and wall-bound hydroxycinnamic acid-esters in epidermal, phloem, and sclerenchyma tissues.
2055219484	Cellulosimicrobium funkei is a rare, opportunistic pathogen. We describe a case of bacteremia and possibly prosthetic valve endocarditis by this organism in a nonimmunocompromised patient. Useful phenotypic tests for differentiating C. funkei from Cellulosimicrobium cellulans and Cellulosimicrobium terreum include motility, raffinose fermentation, glycogen, D-xylose, and methyl-α-D-glucopyranoside assimilation, and growth at 35°C.
2055219521	To exit the blood, leukocytes must either squeeze past or go directly through the endothelial cells that line the vessels. According to Christopher Carman, Timothy Springer (Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA), and colleagues, to take the latter transcellular route, leukocytes first palpate the endothelial cell with exploratory protrusions called podosomes. The leukocytes then use one, or sometimes several, of these podosomes to push right on through.    Figure 1  A leukocyte (pink) palpates an endothelial cell (gray) with podosomes until it finds a route through.    The team found that approximately one-third of leukocytes made their way across an in vitro vascular endothelial monolayer by transcellular migration. Carman suggests that, in vivo, at least in some settings, the proportion might be higher. Transcellular migration might even be favored over the paracellular route, as the latter could potentially weaken cell–cell junctions.  To investigate the mechanism of transcellular migration, the team used a combination of live fluorescence and electron microscopy. Shortly after leukocytes were added to the monolayer, invaginations in the endothelial membranes appeared coincident with the formation of podosomes by the leukocytes.  The leukocytes used these podosomes to prod and poke the endothelial cell until they find a route of least resistance. Organelles other than the nucleus were then pushed out of the way as one large, invasive podosome created a transcellular pore. Leukocytes that were deficient for an actin regulatory protein called WASP formed podosomes poorly and were thus inefficient in forming transcellular pores. Paracellular migration continued as normal, however.  Endothelial cells survived despite this continuous puncturing by migrating leukoctyes. Indeed, multiple leukocytes were able to pass through a single endothelial cell—Carman has spotted up to eight at a time—lending further evidence that this could be the predominant route for transendothelial leukocyte migration in vivo.

2055219527	Embryo implantation is a complicated process involving interactions between the blastocyst and the luminal epithelium of the receptive uterus. Mucin 1 (MUC1) is an integral membrane glycoprotein expressed apically by secretory epithelial cells and the glandular epithelium in different organs, including the uterus. It is believed that loss of MUC1 on the surface of uterine epithelial cells is necessary for embryo implantation. The endogenous non-protein coding microRNAs (miRNAs) of 21-24 nucleotides are found in diverse organisms. It has been shown that miRNAs participate in a range of cellular processes by regulating gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. In the present study, the regulatory role of miRNA-199a on the expression of MUC1 in mouse uterus during implantation was investigated for its effect on embryo implantation. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry results showed high MUC1 expression on Day 0.5 and low expression by Day 4.5 of pregnancy. In contrast with MUC1 expression, increased miRNA-199a expression was evident at Day 4.5 of pregnancy, as measured by real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. In addition, we demonstrated direct binding of miRNA-199a to the 3'-untranslated region of MUC1. Transfection of miRNA-199a into mouse uterine epithelial cells isolated from Day 0.5 of pregnancy also downregulated expression of MUC1. Therefore, the present study provides evidence that MUC1 is a direct target of miRNA-199a and suggests that development of novel strategies to facilitate a successful pregnancy and repair implantation failure humans may include miRNA.
2055219533	Ixodes persulcatus is the primary vector for human tick-borne diseases in Japan. A cDNA library was constructed from whole body homogenates of fed nymphs of I. persulcatus. From this library, one cDNA encoding defensin-like antimicrobial peptide was identified. The amino-acid sequence showed high similarity to those of the defensins of other ticks and arthropods. I. persulcatus defensin mRNA transcripts were detected at all life cycle stages of fed ticks and found to be predominantly expressed in the midguts of adult female ticks, but not in the salivary glands, a finding corroborated by Western blotting analysis. To investigate the function of I. persulcatus defensin, we examined its antibacterial activity by evaluation of growth of several bacterial strains in the presence of the synthetic peptide. The defensin from I. persulcatus markedly inhibited the growth of Gram-positive bacteria including Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis and Corynebacterium renale, but not Gram-negative bacteria except Escherichia coli O157. In conclusion, these results suggest that I. persulcatus defensin may be playing a significant role in the defence against microbes from bloodmeals.
2055219572	Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a neurodegenerative disease resulting from decreased levels of survival motor neuron 1 (SMN1) protein. Reduced SMN1 levels are linked to pathology at neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), which includes decreased vesicle density and organization, decreased quantal release, increased endplate potential duration, and neurofilament (NF) accumulations. This work presents a first study towards defining molecular alterations that may lead to the development of NMJ pathology in SMA. Fast, anterograde transport of synaptic vesicle 2 (SV2-c) and synaptotagmin (Syt1) proteins was reduced 2 days prior to the observed decrease in synaptic vesicle density. Moreover, reduced accumulation of SV2-c or Syt1 was not due to reduced protein expression or reduced kinesin activity. Dynein levels were reduced at times that are consistent with NF accumulations at NMJs. Furthermore, NF distribution, from cell body to sciatic nerve, appeared normal in SMA∆7 mice. Taken together, these results suggest that reduced axonal transport may provide a mechanistic explanation for reduced synaptic vesicle density and concomitant synaptic transmission defects, while providing evidence that suggests NF accumulations result from local NMJ alterations to NFs.
2055219573	Explants of fetal rat liver maintained in organ culture lost about 40% of their mass in 42 hr of incubation as a result of decrease in blood cells and hepatocytes. Proteins from the cytosol and particulate elements of the tissue were found in the culture medium. About 60% of this protein was degraded to peptides during culture. The transfer of malate and lactate dehydrogenases from tissue to medium paralleled that of proteins. Glutamate dehydrogenase was lost from the mitochondria and in part leaked through the cell membrane into the medium. Net loss of activity of the three enzymes occurred, probably as a consequence of proteolytic degradation. Of 12 enzymes in liver tissue, the specific activities of eight—soluble malate dehydrogenase, glutamate dehydrogenase, succinate dehydrogenase, phosphopyruvate carboxylase, hexosediphosphatase, glucose-6-phosphatase, tyrosine, aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase—were unchanged or increased. Glycogen synthetase, aspartate aminotransferase, pyruvate kinase, and lactate dehydrogenase decreased. Although changes in membrane permeability may have had some influence on the results reported, the predominant effect was due to loss of protein from tissue as a result of discharge of total contents of some of the cells into the medium. The residual explanted tissue retained its structural integrity. It is concluded that fetal rat liver in organ culture provides a suitable model system for controlled studies with this organ in vitro.
2055219574	Tan spot of wheat, caused by the ascomycete Pyrenophora tritici-repentis, is an economically important disease in all the major wheat growing areas worldwide. Even though the pathogen was known to occur on grasses and episodically on wheat for more than eight decades, large-scale epidemics of tan spot were first recorded in the early 1970s. The increased incidence was associated with stubble retention, a practice implemented in the context of soil conservation. The present review highlights some of the recent developments that have occurred in studies of the wheat - P. tritici-repentis interaction and discusses the implications for our understanding of host-parasite relations in general. Races of P. tritici-repentis produce at least three host-specific toxins, effective on particular host lines or cultivars. Single dominant and independently inherited genes control host reaction to these toxins, with one gene for each toxin. Eight races of the pathogen have now been identified from collections made in sev...

Maryland Catterton. 2. 2. 6-Benzylaminopurine-treated axillary buds contained higher levels of free ATP than the controls during the release of buds from dormancy. 3. 3. The rate of Me − 14 C incorporation from methionine into polar and neutral lipids is enhanced by cytokinin between 6 and 18 h after bud treatment.
2055219696	Two feeding trials were conducted to evaluate the soybean meal as a substitute for the fish meal in diet (experiment I), and experimental practical diet and commercial diet (experiment II) for growth of far eastern catfish. In the experiment I, three replicate groups of juveniles (average weight 7.2 g) were fed one of diets containing 0, 10 and 20% soybean meals for 66 days. Survival and final mean weight were not significantly affected by dietary soybean meal levels. No significant differences were observed in feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio and protein retention of fish fed between 0% (control diet) and 20% soybean meal diets. However, fish fed 10% soybean meal diet showed the lower feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio and protein retention, and higher daily feed intake compared with fish fed control diet and 20% soybean meal diet. The contents of moisture, crude protein, crude lipid and ash in the whole body were not significantly affected by dietary soybean meal levels. In the experiment II, three replicate groups of juveniles (average weight 7.3 g) were fed either the formulated diet or commercial diet for 66 days. Survival and final mean weight were not significantly different among treatment. Significantly higher feed efficiency, protein efficiency ratio and protein retention, and lower daily feed intake were observed in fish fed experimental practical diet compared with fish fed commercial diet (P
2055219738	The inactivation of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene not only results in tumor initiation, but also mediates tumor metastasis. However, the mechanisms by which VHL inactivation leads to metastasis have not yet been well defined. In this study, the silencing of VHL in 3AO and SKOV3 ovarian cancer cells was found to promote cell motility and to increase the expression of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)2, MMP9, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-α (HIF-1α) and microRNA (miR)-210. The suppression of HIF-1α with its inhibitor 3-(5'-hydroxymethyl-2'-furyl)-1-benzylindazole (YC-1) in VHL-silenced 3AO cells antagonized the pro-migratory activity induced by the VHL deficiency and reversed the upregulation of MMP2, MMP9, HIF-1α and miR-210; however, it had no obvious effect on the VHL protein level. The introduction of miR-210 inhibitor into VHL-silenced 3AO cells resulted in similar changes as those induced by YC-1. Furthermore, vacuole membrane protein 1 (VMP1) was found to be diminished by VHL silencing in a HIF-1α/miR-210-dependent manner. Taken together, our data demonstrate that the loss of VHL stimulates ovarian cancer cell migration by stabilizing HIF-1α, upregulating miR-210 and decreasing VMP1 expression. These results indicate that the aberrant signaling of the VHL/HIF-1α/miR-210/VMP1 pathway may be involved in ovarian cancer aggressiveness.
2055219788	Twenty-nine patients with chronic hepatitis C and 15 asymptomatic hepatitis C virus antibody–positive subjects who clinically recovered from hepatitis C virus infection were studied for their peripheral blood lymphomononuclear cell proliferative response to hepatitis C virus structural and nonstructural antigens (core, envelope, nonstructural 4 and nonstructural 5) expressed in yeast as superoxide dismutase fusion proteins, in an initial attempt to define some of the features of the virus-specific immune response. Hepatitis C virus core was the most immunogenic antigen for human leukocyte antigen class II–restricted T cells in both groups of patients studied, and the proliferative response to it was the most vigorous and the most frequently expressed in comparison with the other antigens tested. The specificity of the results was supported by the lack of response to hepatitis C virus antigens by healthy uninfected controls and confirmed by recognition of recombinant core proteins of different origin (yeast and baculovirus) by polyclonal T-cell lines produced by T-cell stimulation with yeast-derived core. Each of the antigens tested was able to induce significant although variable levels of proliferative response, indicating that all can be immunogenic at the T-cell level. Significant proliferative responses to core, nonstructural 4 and nonstructural 5 antigens were more frequently detected in subjects who were able to eradicate infection than in patients with chronic hepatitis C, although the difference was statistically not significant. No difference was observed between the two groups of patients with respect to the response to the putative envelope antigens. (Hepatology 1994;19:286–295).
2055219811	During development of the retina in mammals and birds, most retinal ganglion cells (RGC) that are produced are eliminated later in development by cell death. In lower vertebrates, however, such massive cell death has not been observed; total ganglion cell number increases linearly during most of development. Using 3H-thymidine or 5-bromodeoxyuridine labeling of retinal cell nuclei, we have been able to identify postmitotic RGC populations in Xenopus central retina at different developmental stages and follow their fate during development to postmetamorphic stages. RGC populations that become postmitotic between embryonic stages 32 and 49, during the initial stages of retinal growth, lose 40-77% of their cells during metamorphosis (approximately 4,000-5,000 cells). Twenty percent of the RGC present at stage 54, which later disappear, represent the same population of dying RGC that were present at stage 49. This suggests that the ganglion cells that became postmitotic between stage 49 and 53/54 show no apparent decline in numbers during metamorphosis. Since thyroxine is known to stimulate an increase in RGC number as well as the extent of fiber projection on the tectum, we suggest that this reduction in RGC numbers is not due to thyroxine-induced neuronal cell death. After stage 54, however, binocular vision develops in Xenopus (Keating, '74) and ipsilateral fibers begin to grow into thalamic visual neuropils (Hoskins and Grobstein, '85). We suggest, therefore, that as in mammals, in which RGC elimination correlates with binocular segregation of contralateral and ipsilateral retinal axons in visual centers, a similar process may occur in the frog among those RGC projecting to thalamic visual neuropils.
2055219844	A dwarf plant isolated from anther culture of a normal genotype of birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L. cv. Leo) has been isolated, characterized, and maintained as an in vitro shoot-tip culture. The dwarf condition is the result of a much shorter internode length when compared with a normal genotype in shoot tip culture. Dwarf shoots which are typically rosette respond to increased GA3 levels by increased internode growth. Normal genotypes are inhibited and eventually die as a result of increased levels of GA3 in the culture medium. This dwarf has the normal tetraploid chromosome number of 24, and although stable in shoot tip cultures since 1977, has not survived outside of in vitro shoot tip cultures.
2055219921	We have devised techniques with which to detect specific proteins as well as mRNAs in individual cells of the nervous system. We have localized proteins to specific cells in sections of the neonatal rat cerebellum by immunofluorescence and in the same cells have localized mRNAs by in situ hybridization. The specific protein identified was glial fibrillary acidic protein. The [3H] complementary DNA probes used in the in situ hybridization experiments were synthesized using as templates polyadenylated mRNAs isolated from neonatal rat cerebellum. Such dual detection can be used to assess the cellular sites of synthesis of the many proteins that have been localized in brain and other tissues by immunohistochemistry.
2055219977	Infectious diseases are responsible for the extinction of a number of species. In conventional epidemic models, the transition from endemic population persistence to extirpation takes place gradually. However, if host demographics exhibits a strong Allee effect (AE) (population decline at low densities), extinction can occur abruptly in a catastrophic population crash. This might explain why species suddenly disappear even when they used to persist at high endemic population levels. Mathematically, the tipping point towards population collapse is associated with a saddle-node bifurcation. The underlying mechanism is the simultaneous population size depression and the increase of the extinction threshold due to parasite pathogenicity and Allee effect. Since highly pathogenic parasites cause their own extinction but not that of their host, there can be another saddle-node bifurcation with the re-emergence of two endemic equilibria. The implications for control interventions are discussed, suggesting that ef...
2055220017	Cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) recognize protein antigens which have been processed by the target cell and then presented in association with the relevant class I molecule of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Short synthetic peptides, which are able to associate directly with target cells, may substitute for these processed fragments in stimulating antigen-specific CTL responses. Using this approach, a dominant HLA-A2-restricted epitope has previously been mapped to residues 58-68 of influenza A virus matrix protein. Here we report HLA-A2-restricted CTL which are also able to recognize this short synthetic peptide in association with HLA-Aw69, but which fail to recognize HLA-Aw69 expressing cells infected with influenza A virus. Furthermore, individuals possessing HLA-Aw69 who respond to influenza A virus, do not respond to M58-68. These results imply that the low response to this epitope on infection of HLA-Aw69 individuals with influenza A is due to failure of the naturally processed product of matrix protein to associate with Aw69.
2055220027	Using Roche/454 technology, we sequenced the chloroplast genomes of 12 Triticeae species, including bread wheat, barley and rye, as well as the diploid progenitors and relatives of bread wheat Triticum urartu, Aegilops speltoides and Ae. tauschii. Two wild tetraploid taxa, Ae. cylindrica and Ae. geniculata, were also included. Additionally, we incorporated wild Einkorn wheat Triticum boeoticum and its domesticated form T. monococcum and two Hordeum spontaneum (wild barley) genotypes. Chloroplast genomes were used for overall sequence comparison, phylogenetic analysis and dating of divergence times. We estimate that barley diverged from rye and wheat approximately 8–9 million years ago (MYA). The genome donors of hexaploid wheat diverged between 2.1–2.9 MYA, while rye diverged from Triticum aestivum approximately 3–4 MYA, more recently than previously estimated. Interestingly, the A genome taxa T. boeoticum and T. urartu were estimated to have diverged approximately 570,000 years ago. As these two have a reproductive barrier, the divergence time estimate also provides an upper limit for the time required for the formation of a species boundary between the two. Furthermore, we conclusively show that the chloroplast genome of hexaploid wheat was contributed by the B genome donor and that this unknown species diverged from Ae. speltoides about 980,000 years ago. Additionally, sequence alignments identified a translocation of a chloroplast segment to the nuclear genome which is specific to the rye/wheat lineage. We propose the presented phylogeny and divergence time estimates as a reference framework for future studies on Triticeae.
2055220044	TRIM5alpha is a host restriction factor that mediates a CA-specific block to retroviral infection. TRIM5alpha binding to the viral protein is only detectable when CA is in the multimeric protein lattice of the retroviral core. This suggested that TRIM5alpha might function as a pattern recognition receptor (PRR) analogous to a TLR. Additionally, TRIM5 is located within a cluster of interferon-stimulated genes. We therefore sought evidence for functional links between TRIM5alpha and innate immune factors.  TRIM5alpha was induced by type I interferons and PRR agonists in THP-1 cells and monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. Induction kinetics, knockdown of IRF3, STAT1, STAT2, or IFNaR, and IFNaR-blocking antibodies, demonstrated that TRIM5alpha induction is ISGF3-dependent. In parallel, we found that establishment of an antiviral state with interferon or PRR agonists prevented HIV-1 transduction of THP1 cells or monocyte-derived dendritic cells and macrophages. TRIM5alpha knockdown in THP1 cells largely rescued HIV-1 from the antiviral state, independent of envelope pseudotype. This effect of TRIM5 knockdown was independent of CA and even observed with non-retroviruses. We have now established that TRIM5 contributes to the antiviral state via effects on specific factors that act upstream of NFκB and AP-1.
2055220131	Neuronal ceroid-lipofuscinosis is the most common class of neurodegenerative disease in children. After decades of study, the biochemical basis for this group of diseases continues to elude scientists. One obstacle has been the difficulty in establishing specific criteria for diagnosis. This paper reviews case material from 65 patients referred to the Shriver Center for study from January, 1984 to December, 1986. The late-infantile type was the most commonly encountered (35%) with a mean age-of-onset of 3.1 +/- 0.5 yr. The juvenile type was slightly less frequent (32%) with a mean age-of-onset of 7.8 +/- 4 yr. The infantile type ranked third (23%); age-of-onset 11 +/- 4 months) and the adult form of the disease was the least common (10%; age-of-onset 25 +/- 4 yr). Consistent clinical findings were a progressive decline in mental faculties and seizures, predominantly of the myoclonic type. Neuroradiological changes of cerebral and cerebellar cortical atrophy were common when studies were obtained more than a year after clinical onset. Ataxia was a frequent manifestation in the late-infantile and juvenile types whereas dystonia was unique to the latter. There was a diversity of ultrastructural findings in skin biopsies between and within types. The absence of findings in a few familial cases necessitated sampling a second tissue such as muscle, particularly when the history was suggestive and urine dolichols were high. Elevated urine dolichol levels was a nonspecific but helpful finding.
2055220220	The mitotic checkpoint plays an important role in preventing chromosome segregation errors and the production of aneuploid progeny. In this issue, Zhang et al. examine mice and cells lacking the deubiquitinating enzyme USP44. Surprisingly, they find that USP44 prevents chromosome segregation errors through a function independent of its previously identified role in the mitotic checkpoint. Usp44-null animals develop aneuploidy and experience increased rates of tumorigenesis, implicating USP44 as novel tumor suppressor.
2055220259	Epithelia are key barriers to infections. In periodontal disease, the gingival sulcular epithelium becomes ulcerated. In this report, we test the hypothesis that short-chain carboxylic acids (SCCA) inhibit keratinocyte proliferation, increase necrosis and apoptosis, and may thus promote ulceration. SCCA produced by bacteria are present at millimolar concentrations in the periodontal pockets of subjects with periodontal disease. SCCA concentrations are higher in subjects with severe disease than in those with mild disease, and are not detectable in healthy subjects. Cell proliferation is critical for maintenance of epithelial barrier function. All SCCA tested, when neutralized, decreased epithelial cell proliferation (as measured by 3H-thymidine incorporation) in a dose-dependent manner. We found that epithelial cell viability decreased with increasing SCCA concentrations, accounting at least partly for the decreased 3H-thymidine incorporation. For all conditions we tested, SCCA-induced apoptosis preceded and exceeded necrosis. While the molecular mechanism(s) for these effects remain to be determined, the results indicate that SCCA derived from caries- or periodontal disease-associated bacteria could alter gingival barrier function.
2055220309	Tunisia has experienced a variety of human migrations that have modeled the myriad cul- tural groups inhabiting the area. Both Arabic and Ber- ber-speaking populations live in Tunisia. Berbers are commonly considered as in situ descendants of peoples who settled roughly in Palaeolithic times, and posterior demographic events such as the arrival of the Neolithic, the Arab migrations, and the expulsion of the ''Moors'' from Spain, had a strong cultural influence. Nonetheless, the genetic structure and the population relationships of the ethnic groups living in Tunisia have been poorly assessed. In order to gain insight into the paternal genetic landscape and population structure, more than 40 Y-chromosome single nucleotide polymorphisms and 17 short tandem repeats were analyzed in five Tunisian ethnic groups (three Berber-speaking isolates, one Anda- lusian, and one Cosmopolitan Arab). The most common lineage was the North African haplogroup E-M81 (71%), being fixed in two Berber samples (Chenini-Douiret and Jradou), suggesting isolation and genetic drift. Differen- tial levels of paternal gene flow from the Near East were detected in the Tunisian samples (J-M267 lineage over 30%); however, no major sub-Saharan African or Euro- pean influence was found. This result contrasts with the high amount of sub-Saharan and Eurasian maternal lin- eages previously described in Tunisia. Overall, our results reveal a certain genetic inter-population diver- sity, especially among Berber groups, and sexual asym- metry, paternal lineages being mostly of autochthonous origin. In addition, Andalusians, who are supposed to be migrants from southern Spain, do not exhibit any sub- stantial contribution of European lineages, suggesting a North African origin for this ethnic group.

2240721271	The packaging of chromosomal DNA by nucleosomes not only condenses and organizes the genome but also blocks access of DNA-binding proteins to regulatory DNA elements. However, this process also allows nucleosomes and other chromatin components to actively participate in the regulation of transcription, DNA replication, DNA repair, and other chromosomal processes. To enable dynamic regulation of nucleosomes, cells have evolved a set of specialized chromatin remodeling complexes (termed Remodelers) that use the energy of ATP hydrolysis to slide, destabilize, eject, or edit/restructure nucleosomes. Here, we address many aspects of Remodeler function, including their composition, specialization, mechanisms, and regulation. We also address their roles in embryonic stem cells, differentiation, development, cancer, and human disease syndromes.
2398590994	In two cases of polyepiphyseal dysplasia with a probable autosomal recessive transmission, ultrastructural abnormalities were found in the chondrocytes of the tibial epiphyseal growth plate. The largest part of the chondrocytes is occupied by many large vacuoles. They are bounded by a single membrane and have an electron-lucent background in which electron-opaque granules and delicate spiral filaments are visible. The ultrastructural abnormalities suggest a storage disorder probably limited to the chondrocytes.
2398591183	Immunologic, biochemical, and morphologic characteristics of the mononuclear cell from the leukemia of F344 rats were determined. The cells were morphologically similar to large granular lymphocytes (LGL). Surface marker analysis revealed Fc gamma receptors, no Fc gamma receptor or complement receptor activity, and an inability to spontaneously rosette guinea pig erythrocytes. Leukemia cells also had a surface immunoglobulin that hemagglutinated normal rat erythrocytes. The surface immunoglobulin and Fc gamma receptors dissociated from the cell after 2 hours of in vitro incubation, but Fc gamma receptor activity was reexpressed after 6 hours of in vitro incubation. Cells were capable of adherence to glass surfaces but had a low capacity for phagocytosis of latex beads. Cytochemical analysis revealed a consistent, strongly positive reaction for esterase that was sensitive to NaF. The cytochemical profile of the leukemia cell was similar to that described for LGL.
2398591199	We have demonstrated that anticancer drugs at cytostatic concentrations enhance the expression and function of epidermal growth factor (EGF-R) and transferrin (TRF-R) receptors on human tumor cells. We hypothesized that these effects could represent a protective response of tumor cells to sublethal antiproliferative stimuli which could lead to enhanced growth potential. 72 hours exposure of human melanoma GLL-19 cells to 1,000 nM ara-C induced growth inhibition and increased the number of EGF-R, TRF-R and nerve growth factor receptor (NGF-R) on cell surface. Enhanced expression of beta 3 integrins CD49a, CD49c and CD49e, av integrin CD51, beta 3 integrin CD61, CD58/LFA3 and collagen IV and laminin was also detected in ara-C-treated GLL-19 cells. These changes at the tumor cell surface were paralleled by increased in vitro adhesion, invasive potential and clonogenic growth in soft agar and in vivo tumor formation. A more aggressive tumor cell phenotype is induced in human melanoma cells after transient exposure to cytostatic concentrations of ara-C.
2240721652	The spider abundance in weeded and non-weeded plots in a lime orchard was compared. The experiment was done at the Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC), Homestead, Florida. Samplings were taken from April to July 1998. The results of the preliminary test showed that the abundance of the web-building spiders was not significantly different between the weeded and the non-weeded plots for all the sampling periods. However, for hunting spiders the abundance was significantly higher in the non-weeded plots than in the weeded plots. This results suggests the importance of weeds as refuge area for the hunting spiders.
2240721967	This study was conducted to assess three stakeholders’ level of involvement in coral reef conservation activities in Perhentian Island. The stakeholders participated in this study encompassed of the Besut District Department of Marine Parks (Terengganu), local entrepreneurs and tourists. A total of 200 respondents were selected to answer the survey questionnaire. The chi-square test results found a difference in the level of involvement among stakeholders with the Besut District Department of Marine Parks (Terengganu) and local entrepreneurs has the highest level of involvement, while there was low involvement with the tourists. The majority (40%) of the Besut District Department of Marine Parks (Terengganu) staff were involved in the coral reef conservation at the rate of one to three times a year. Similarly, for the entrepreneurs, the majority (44%) of them also involved in the coral reef conservation at a rate one to three times a year while the majority of tourists (72%) never involved in the conservation of coral reefs. In terms of types of coral reefs conservation activities, most stakeholders have experiences in beach cleaning activities and education about coral reef conservation (21% for both). Overall, this study conclude with suggestion to improve the level of stakeholders’ involvement in coral reefs conservation in order to achieve the aims of sustainable tourism in the future.
2240722072	Effect of nine carbon, seven nitrogen sources and various temperature and pH regimes were evaluated in vitro on the growth and sporulation of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum isolated from diseased dolichos bean. Sucrose and potassium nitrate proved to be the best carbon and nitrogen sources, respectively for the growth and sporulation of the fungus. The temperature range of 25°C to 28°C and pH range of 6.0 to 7.0 were the optimum for the fungal growth and sporulation Richard's broth.

Box 3420100, Thika, Kenya 3 University of Nairobi, Department of Pharmacognosy, P. O. Box 301970100, Nairobi, Kenya *Corresponding Author’s Email: jamionusus@yahoo.com Launaea cornuta is an erect perennial plant with hollow stems up to 1.5 m high and creeping rhizomes and belongs to the family of Asteraceae which is the largest family of flowering plants. A single plant can cover a large area as a result of spread by rhizomes. L. cornuta can become a dominant weed in a range of semiarid subtropical ecologies. The herb is native to Africa and occurs on alluvial soils in cultivated areas, including irrigated crops, on roadsides, near rivers and bush vegetation. L. cornuta is used as a wild vegetable in African communities as source for vitamin C. The decoction is used to treat typhoid, ear pain, stomach pain, chronic join pain, measles, gonorrhea, ascariasis, swollen testicles, warts, diabetes and in the management of breast cancer and benign prostate hyperplasia. The objective of the study was to carryout physical and chemical properties of the plant constituent as well as screening for cytotoxic activity against brine shrimps. The plant materials were collected and dried under shade in the laboratory benches. The ground materials were used for preliminary phytochemical studies and revealed the presence of tannins, flavonoids, alkaloids, glycosides, steroids, coumarins, gums, mucilages, phenols, terpenoids and fatty acids while saponins, volatile oils and phlobotanins were absent. Extraction was achieved by sequential maceration using petroleum ether, chloroform and methanol respectively. Aqueous extract was prepared separately. The organic solvent extracts were dried in vacuo while the aqueous extract was lyophilized. The brine shrimp lethality tests were carried out and the petroleum ether and chloroform extracts exhibited moderate cytotoxicity against brine shrimp with LC50 value of 373 μg/ml and 342.7 μg/ml respectively. The varied groups of chemicals reported in this herb suggestively indicate lay scientific evidence for the herb use in various ailments and moderate toxicity against brine shrimp is preliminarily justify the reason for embarking on evaluating the herb fractions for bioactivity.

2398591808	Reactive oxygen intermediates are metabolites normally produced on aerobic metabolisms and has been linked to processes like oxidative stress and aging. Despite this negative paradigm about ROI, another set of evidence in mammals suggest that these reactive intermediates can act as important second messengers in a variety of cellular signaling processes such as those involved on the immune response. Primary cultures of hemocytes from the Chilean scallop Argopecten purpuratus were developed to study a possible link between the production of reactive oxygen intermediates and the expression of an antimicrobial peptide, big defensin, under a context of immune response. A modified Leibovitz L-15 medium supplemented with 50% of sterile plasma from scallop was essential for hemocyte adhesion an survival. The ability of these primary cultures to develop an immune response was confirmed by phagocytic activity and ROI production essays. The antimicrobial peptide big defensin was up-regulated in response to the β-glucan zymosan and this up regulation could be diminished near to constitutive levels by the treatment of cultured hemocytes with the antioxidant trolox for 3 hours before the immune induction. This results constitutes the first evidence on invertebrates that supports a rol of intracellular oxygen intermediates as promoters of the expression of an antimicrobial effector during an immune response.
2398591824	Nutrition plays a major influence on reproductive efficiency directly, through supply of nutrients to the physiological functions, and indirectly in the synthesis of hormones and the amount of receptors on cells and their metabolic interactions. The monitoring of body condition score is still the most widely used tool to nutritional monitoring. However, works done in Brazil have shown that the scale score still lacks evaluation and adapted to hair sheep raised in Brazil. Besides this influence, nutrition plays an acute or immediate effect which is also explored in the production system, as the flushing o nutrients, which consists of a supplementation at levels above the requirement of the animals aiming stimulate ovulation rate, size of ovarian follicles and embryo survival. The effect of flushing is already well documented, as well as its limitations. Advances in this issue are the flushing of nutrients with recognized role in reproduction such as fatty acid which must be more studied. Finally, one of the most studied fields currently is the fetal programming or the impact of nutrition during pregnancy on productive and reproductive aspects of the new generation. The increasing knowledge in this area has demonstrated that the success in animal production begins before birth and even in the early embryonic development impacting the entire productive life of the animal.
2398592003	Responses to daily injections of bovine growth hormone (GH, 0.15 mg kg-1 liveweight), beginning on day 10 of lactation, were measured in lactating ewes. Milk yields of GH-treated ewes increased soon after commencement of injections and continued to increase for some 25 days before reaching plateau levels. By comparison, yields of ewes injected with excipient (controls) decreased over the experiment. There was a tendency for contents of milk fat to be higher and milk protein to be lower for GH-treated than for control ewes during the first 15-20 days after injections were started. At the beginning and over the first 15-20 days of the experiment feed intakes of both groups of ewes were similar, but thereafter intakes of GH-treated ewes gradually increased to reach plateau levels some 200-300 g day-1 higher than for control ewes by about day 35. Liveweights of both groups of ewes decreased during the first 2 weeks of treatment then increased, with GH-treated ewes losing, then gaining, more weight than control ewes. The efficiency of food utilization for milk production was higher for GH-treated than control ewes throughout the experiment but digestibility of food organic matter was not different during the eighth week of the experiment. At the end of the experiment, body composition, assessed by dilution of tritiated water, was similar for both groups of ewes. Differences in milk production were not sustained after withdrawal of GH injections. Measurements of tissue uptake of key metabolites were made on days 3 and 45 of GH treatment. On day 3, GH lowered uptake of glucose and non-esterified fatty acids by leg muscle tissue and increased mammary uptake of non-esterified fatty acids. By day 45 there were no apparent differences of tissue uptake of key metabolites. The results indicate that there is a biphasic response to exogenous GH in the lactating ruminant. It appears that initially GH affects nutrient partition thereby increasing supplies to the mammary gland of key nutrients for milk synthesis. In the longer term, GH increases feed intake, which provides sufficient nutrients to sustain increased milk production and also liveweight gain.
2398592105	A total of 1,788 livers from swamp eels (Fluta alba), purchased at a market in Bangkok, Thailand, from April to July 2002, were studied for the prevalence and intensity of Gnasthostoma third stage larvae (L3s). Of all livers, 466 were infected with Gnasthostoma L3s (infection rate = 26%). The larvae recovered averaged 0.43 +/- 0.51 larvae/liver. All larvae were identified as Gnasthostoma spinigerm by morphological criteria. The prevalence of G. spinigerum L3s in the eels was much higher in the rainy season (June and July, 74%) than during April and May (8%). Therefore, prevention programs for gnathostomiasis should be emphasized during the rainy season.
2398592169	Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) affects one-third of the population and two-thirds of patients with obesity or type 2 diabetes (T2DM). Its more aggressive form is known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and is characterized by hepatocyte necrosis, inflammation and often fibrosis. The presence of fibrosis indicates a more aggressive course and may lead to cirrhosis. Premature mortality in NASH is related to both hepatic (cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma) and extra-hepatic complications, largely cardiovascular disease (CVD). Many therapeutic agents have been tested, but still none approved specifically for NASH. Treatment of NAFLD includes aggressive management of diabetes and cardiovascular risk factors, although the role of controlling hyperglycemia per se in patients with T2DM and NASH remains unknown. Agents tested with some success in non-diabetic patients with NASH include pioglitazone, liraglutide, vitamin E and to a lesser degree, pentoxiphylline. In patients with T2DM and NASH only pioglitazone has shown to significantly improve liver histology, with only a handful of patients with diabetes having been studied with other modalities. This review focuses on available agents for NASH to assist clinicians in the management of these complex patients. Many novel compounds are being studied and will likely make combination therapy for NASH a reality in the future.

2240722587	The well known HLA/disease associations have often in the past been attributed to the effects of Class 1 or 11 MHC products on an individual’s immune responsiveness. However there are reasons for thinking that more than one mechanism may be responsible for these associations. In this paper, we will outline the evidence which leads us to conclude that the Class 111 genes, encoding polymorphisms for the complement system proteins of C4A, C4B, and C2 govern susceptibility to systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
2240722853	A new and distinct Mandevilla plant named ‘Tsuruhanbestpinki-1’ of upright and vining plant habit, relatively small glossy foliage, freely branching habit, freely flowering habit, and being in full flower around Mother's Day as illustrated.
2240723585	Objective : Whole plant and various parts of Thevetia peruviana were reported to possess several pharmacological properties, due to the vast array of secondary metabolites. The present investigation was carried out to illustrate the cytotoxic and antimicrobial properties of seed kernel extracts on two tumor cell lines and various human skin-pathogenic microbes. Methods : Cold methanol extracts and successive soxhlet fractions of seed samples were incubated with tumor cell lines in vitro for 3 h at 37 o C, and cell viability was assessed by trypan blue exclusion method. Antimicrobial efficacy was detected by well diffusion protocol against five bacterial strains and two fungal strains at varying concentrations ranging from 10-0.025 mg/6 mm wells, using different fractions from three color variants. Results : Of the evaluated samples, cold extract of seed kernels has potent cytotoxicity, with IC 50 values 0.458 and 0.522 mg/ml on both cell lines than soxhleted ethyl acetate (EA) fractions (0.851 and 0.712 mg/ml). Antimicrobial efficacy against Pseudomonas aeruginosa (18.67±1.15 mm), Nocardia asteroids (15.00±0.00) and Candida albicans (14.33±0.58) strains were effective for EA (10 mg/well) than chloroform (CH) and methanol (MT) fractions, but lower concentrations of CH fractions showed higher sensitivity against C. albicans . Conclusion : Cytotoxic properties of seed kernels could be utilized against various human cancer cell lines to reduce tumor growth, and the bactericidal and fungicidal efficacy would be helpful in eradicating some common human skin infectious pathogenic microbes.
2240723666	A cardioacceleratory peptide, CAP2b, identified originally in the lepidopteran Manduca sexta, stimulates fluid secretion by Malpighian tubules of the dipteran Drosophila melanogaster. High-performance liquid chromatography analyses of adult D. melanogaster reveal the presence of a CAP2b-like peptide, that coelutes with M. sexta CAP2b and synthetic CAP2b and that has CAP2b-like effects on the M. sexta heart. CAP2b accelerates fluid secretion in tubules stimulated by adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP) but has no effect on tubules stimulated by guanosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cGMP), implying that it acts through the latter pathway. By contrast, the action of leucokinin is additive to both cAMP and cGMP but not to thapsigargin, suggesting that leucokinin acts by the elevation of intracellular calcium. CAP2b stimulation elevates tubule cGMP levels but not those of cAMP. By contrast, leucokinin has no effect on levels of either cyclic nucleotide. Both CAP2b and cGMP increase transepithelial potential difference, suggesting that stimulation of vacuolar-adenosinetriphosphatase action underlies the corresponding increases in fluid secretion. Overall, the results show that a Drosophila CAP2b-related peptide acts to stimulate fluid secretion by Malpighian tubules through the cGMP-signaling pathway.
2240723861	The paper aims to emphasize the last decade status of the most frequent mycotoxic contaminants of the common crop cereals: maize, wheat, barley, two row barley, soy, rye, etc. The structure of the main mycotoxins treated in this paper (ochratoxine, zearalenone, aflatoxine, trichotecene, patulin, fumonisine) is presented, mentioning the producing organisms. The limits stipulated by Romanian authorities are comparatively presented with those present in EU. The importance of the environmental factors (clime, temperature, moisture, storage conditions, etc.) on mycotoxic cereal contamination is also treated.
2398592543	The existence of a hepato-biliary pump for IgA has been studied in sheep by measuring appearance of radioactivity in bile after simultaneous i.v. injection of IgG2 and homologous dimeric IgA each labelled with either 125I or 131I. These experiments confirm that in sheep, as in rodents, IgA is the predominant immunoglobulin in bile and is selectively transported into bile from serum relative to IgG2. In addition, there is evidence for local production of IgA in bile presumably by plasma cells within the liver and biliary tree.
2398592632	Cholestyramine feeding of rats increased the rate of palmitate and glycerol incorporation into triacylglycerols of isolated hepatocytes. Concomitantly an increase of fatty-acid binding by hepatic cytosolic proteins was observed, which could be attributed to an elevation of the content of the fatty-acid-binding protein (Mr 12000). The involvement of this protein in cholesterol, bile-acid and triacylglycerol metabolism is discussed.
2398592919	Manipulating stand composition is an important management tool that foresters can use to affect the nature of forests and ecosystem processes. In mixed stands, interspecific interactions among trees can cause changes in tree performances. Nevertheless, these interactions are context dependent (cf. stress-gradient hypothesis, SGH). We thus investigated how intraspecific functional changes in leaf trait (19 traits) of European beech (Fagus sylvatica) were influenced by stand composition. We compared pure beech stands with four mixed stands containing from one to three additional tree species along a gradient of edaphic stress (gradient of soil water-holding capacity and rooting depth). First, we demonstrated that stand composition induced strong intraspecific leaf trait variation in beech for LDMC, LMA, phenolic compounds, leaf pH and magnesium concentration, suggesting higher nutrient acquisition by more diverse stands. Nevertheless, these results were modulated by edaphic stress. Mixed stands only conferred an advantage in relatively stressed sites (luvisol and leptosol). Besides, the addition of oak to beech stands had unexpected negative effects in sites with less severe stress (cambisol) as indicated by the null or positive LogRR of LMA, LDMC and phenolics. This study found that stand composition is an important though often-overlooked driver of intraspecific variability in leaf quality, and potentially reflects changes in beech tree physiology and productivity. Our results also suggest that positive interactions prevail in sites with stressful conditions. Such validation of the SGH is rare in natural or managed mature forests. Lastly, we strongly recommend that forest managers consider stand composition and abiotic factors when implementing forest growth models to improve their yield predictions.
2398592944	The effect of feeding diets containing various Ca:P ratios (4:1, 1:1, 1:2) to rachitic and nonrachitic chicks has been studied. The Ca:P ratios used had no significant effect on Ca absorption in chicks receiving vitamin D but were of importance in the Ca absorption of rachitic chicks. Vitamin D was found to increase Ca absorption in chick duodenum but had no effect on glucose absorption. Increased peristalsis was obtained when vitamin D or the least rachitogenic Ca:P ratio (1:1) was fed. A possible increase in intestinal mucosa respiration was also observed when vitamin D or the 1:1 Ca:P ratio was fed.
2398593104	"The influence of closing the eyes (by means of a special device) on the neuronal activity in the visual and motor cortical areas was analysed in a trained rabbit during behavioural act of seizing the food. It was found that activation of the neurones of both cortical areas in the course of the act appears both with closed and open eyes at all its stages, i.e. for appearance of neurons activity no contact is required with the ""visual part"" of the surroundings. This fact is discussed from the viewpoint of ""purposive"" neuronal activity. Both the composition of the involved elements of both cortical areas and the shape of their activity were changing during performance of behaviour with closed eyes, the changes being more pronounced in the visual area. A hypothesis is advanced that the differences in the changeability of the neuronal activation in the studied structures are determined by their heterochronous maturation in the process of behaviour formation in ontogenesis."
2398593113	Metal pollution issues are afforded the highest priority in developing countries. Only one previous study has addressed metals in African bird eggs. We determined the concentration of metals and metalloids in bird eggs from four sites in the Vaal River catchment (VRC) of South Africa to provide data on the current situation. We analysed 16 pools of 77 heron, ibis, darter, egret, and cormorant eggs for 18 metals and metalloids using ICP-MS. We found high concentrations of gold (Au), uranium (U), thallium (Tl), and platinum (Pt) in Grey Heron eggs from Baberspan. Great white egrets from Bloemhof Dam had high concentrations of mercury (Hg). Multivariate analyses revealed strong associations between Au and U, and between palladium (Pd) and Pt. The toxic reference value (TRV) for Hg was exceeded in seven pools. Selenium exceeded its TRV in one pool; in the same pool, copper (Cu) reached its TRV. Compared with other studies, VRC bird eggs had high concentrations of contaminants. Based on these high concentrations, human health might be at risk as Grey Herons and humans share similar food and are therefore exposed to the same contaminants.
2398593123	"Glucocorticoids have strong regulatory actions on the immune system and act as potent therapeutic compounds for autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. We previously reported that the long noncoding RNA growth arrest-specific 5 (Gas5), which accumulates inside the cells in response to cellular starvation/growth arrest, functions as a potent repressor of the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) through its RNA ""glucocorticoid response element (GRE)"". To evaluate potential roles of Gas5 in immune-related disorders, we examined Gas5 RNA levels in various autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases using the microarray data available in the Gene Expression Omnibus. We found that Gas5 levels were altered in whole blood or leukocytes of the patients with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, multiple sclerosis, and sarcoidosis. Gas5 levels were also altered in infectious diseases, such as by the human immunodeficiency virus type-1 and influenza virus, and bacterial sepsis. In our experimental analysis using mice, Gas5 levels were kept at high basal levels and did not respond to fasting in immune organs, such as spleen and thymus, while its levels in metabolic organs, including liver, fat, and skeletal muscles, were low at baseline and were highly elevated upon this treatment, possibly through suppression of the mTOR pathway. These results suggest that Gas5 plays a role in the regulation of immune functions and pathogenesis/pathophysiology of autoimmune, inflammatory, and infectious diseases in part through modulation of the GR transcriptional activity via its decoy RNA ""GRE"". Changes in the Gas5 levels may also influence disease response to immunosuppressive glucocorticoid therapy."
2240724454	The hypothesis is discussed that the innervation of the early mandibular and maxillary processes influences the initiation and patterning of tooth germs. Silver staining of embryonic mouse tissue supports the notion that the innervation is present before tooth buds appear. Data from other experimental studies is discussed in support of this hypothesis. The importance of the early events of tooth morphogenesis in initiating and patterning the dentition is discussed in the context of tooth morphogenesis as a whole. The processes involved in odontogenesis are categorized as Phase I: Initiating events; Phase II: Histogenetic events; and Phase III: Cytodifferentiative events. The complications of the interrelationship of these three seemingly discrete segments of tooth development are discussed in the context of inductive tissue interaction.

2240725476	The present invention provides an MHC class II antigen presentation enhancing hybrid polypeptide. The hybrid has an N-terminus comprising the mammalian Ii-key peptide LRMKLPKPPKPVSKMR (SEQ ID NO: 1) and modifications thereof which retain antigen presentation enhancing activity, a C-terminus comprising an antigenic epitope in the form of a polypeptide or peptidomimetic structure which binds to the antigenic peptide binding site of an MHC class II molecule, and an intervening chemical structure covalently linking the N-terminal and C-terminal components. In a particular embodiment, the hybrid peptides of the present invention comprise influenza MHC class II epitopes identified herein as being effective in generating an immune response and provide immunity to the individual.
2240725506	The selection of alternative splice sites is an important component of cell-specific gene regulation in eukaryotic cells. Use of splice sites can be positively and negatively regulated, and often physiologically appropriate splice site choice is achieved by a balance of the two. RNA elements controlling splice site choice are found in both exons and introns, and these determine management by the cellular splicing machinery. However, the molecular basis of how the splicing machinery responds to these signals in different cells is somewhat of a paradox. Thus far the identified proteins which bind to tissue/cell-specific regulatory elements in mammals are expressed in many different tissues, and not just in the regulating tissue. Potential tissue-specific splicing regulators have been identified by nonbiochemical means. However, alternative splicing choices are likely to be affected by subtle differences in the splicing machinery in different cells. In this review I suggest that one important factor is the ratio of proteins in different nuclear compartments, which might be established in a cell type specific fashion.
2398593209	This paper reports on the effect of various micropropagation factors of Gmelina arborea Roxb. through multiple shoot induction. Factors like the source and age of explants, plant growth regulators (PGRs), media composition, and carbon source affected multiple shooting in the present study. Among all the explants used, only shoot tips derived from one, two, and three week old seedlings could form multiple shoots. Besides, the formation of multiple shoots depended on the concentration and combination of PGRs. Among all the PGRs, BAP (6-benzylaminopurine) alone gave the highest regeneration efficiency. Similarly, IBA (Indole-3-butyric acid) was the most efficient PGR in inducing root formation in the microshoots. Media composition and carbon source also affected the regeneration efficiency. MS (Murashige and Skoog medium) proved to be the best media for regeneration followed by B5, SH (Schenk and Hilderbrandt medium) and WPM (Woody plant medium) in that order. Similarly, among sugars, only sucrose and glucose supported induction of microshoots. Based on this study we recommend the use of glucose in place of sucrose in MS medium for maximum regeneration efficiency.
2398593389	In different physiopathological situations such as embryogenesis, wound repair and tumor invasion, isolated cells, or cell populations exhibit changes to their normal behavior and may acquire different migratory phenotypes. Live-cell imaging associated with the use of appropriate in vitro models in culture has become a powerful analytical tool for studying factors involved in cell migration and in cell-to-cell interactions. The scope of this chapter is to give an overview of in vitro models of cell migration and the technical advances permitting multiparameter quantification. The chapter hereby provides a detailed description of two-dimensional and three-dimensional approaches of cell dispersion and migration and finally gives a brief insight on computational quantification of the cell behavior.
2398593446	4-[4''-(2'',2'',6'',6''-Tetramethyl-1''-piperidinyloxy)amino]-4'- demethylepipodophyllotoxin (GP-7) 10-40 mg.kg-1 ip daily for 7 d reduced the specific antibody formation of splenocytes, serum agglutinin titer, and hemolysin HC50 in mice immunized with SRBC. GP-7 inhibited the footpad delayed hypersensitivity reaction and decreased the weights of spleen and thymus, but did not affect the phagocytic function of the peritoneal macrophages. In vitro the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes activated by Con A was markedly inhibited by GP-7 in a concentration- dependent manner. At concentrations of 0.05-5 mg.L-1, the inhibition rates were 24-96%. These results suggested that GP-7 was an immunosuppressive agent.
2398593621	To study interlaminar phenotypic variations in the pyramidal neurons of parietal isocortex in bat (Cynopterus sphinx), Golgi and Nissl methods have been employed. The parietal isocortex is relatively thin in the bat as compared to prototheria with layer III, V and VI accounting for more than two-thirds of total cortical thickness. Thick cell free layer I and thinnest accentuated layer II are quite in connotation with other chiropterids. Poor demarcation of layer III/IV in the present study is also in connotation with primitive eutherian mammal (i.e. prototherian) and other chiropterids. Most of the pyramidal cells in the different layers of the parietal isocortex are of typical type as seen in other eutherians but differ significantly in terms of soma shape and size, extent of dendritic arbor, diameter of dendrites and spine density. Percentage of pyramidal neurons, diameter of apical dendrite and spine density on apical dendrite appear to follow an increasing trend from primitive to advanced mammals; but extent of dendrites are probably governed by the specific life patterns of these mammals. It is thus concluded that ‘typical’ pyramidal neurons in parietal isocortex are similar in therians but different from those in prototherians. It is possible that these cells might have arisen among early eutherians after divergence from prototherian stock.
2398593644	The COP9 signalosome has been implicated in pluripotency maintenance of human embryonic stem cells. Yet, the mechanism for the COP9 signalosome to regulate pluripotency remains elusive. Through knocking down individual COP9 subunits, we demonstrate that Cops2, but not the whole COP9 signalosome, is essential for pluripotency maintenance in mouse embryonic stem cells. Down-regulation of Cops2 leads to reduced expression of pluripotency genes, slower proliferation rate, G2/M cell cycle arrest, and compromised embryoid differentiation of embryonic stem cells. Cops2 also facilitates somatic cell reprogramming. We further show that Cops2 binds to Nanog protein and prevent the degradation of Nanog by proteasome. Moreover, Cops2 functions as transcriptional corepressor to facilitate pluripotency maintenance. Altogether, our data reveal the essential role and novel mechanisms of Cops2 in pluripotency maintenance.
2240725657	Limousine, Hereford and Simmental bulls were assigned at the start of finishing at 14 months of age to three analogous groups (6 animals per group). During a 70-day treatment period, animals were fed with uniform rations containing maize silage and meadow hay silage ad libitum with a supplement of hay (l kg/day) and concentrate (1% body weight/day). The following parametres were determined: live body weight, chemical composition of feeds, fatty acid profile of feeds, dressing percentage, chemical composition and fatty acid content of thoracis muscle. Limousine and Simmental bulls were characterized by a higher fattening and slaughter value. They also showed a higher level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) of thoracis muscle and a lower content of fatty acids C 14:0 and C 16:0.

2240726058	A new and distinct cultivar of Petunia plant named ‘Sunmilk’, characterized by its outwardly spreading and decumbent plant habit; vigorous and freely branching growth habit; relatively small leaves; numerous light yellow green to white-colored flowers with red purple-colored venation; long flowering period; and good garden performance.
2398594037	The molecular mechanisms of neural plasticity, learning and memory are still poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is capable of responding to a variety of environmental changes through its nervous system, consisting of only 302 neurons. C. elegans is an ideal model organism to elucidate neural plasticity, learning and memory at molecular, cellular and neuronal network levels. Thermotaxis behavior is particularly amenable to dissect learning and memory at all these levels. After cultivation at a certain temperature with food, C. elegans migrates to the cultivation temperature on a temperature gradient. By contrast, cultivation in food-deprived condition induces cultivation temperature avoidance behavior on a temperature gradient. We have been conducting forward as well as reverse genetic approaches to identify molecules, neurons and neuronal networks that are responsible for aspects of learning and memory in thermotaxis behavior.

2398594109	In this review we aim to provide an overview of the published reports on the morphology, position, population, distribution and origin of calcitonin cells.

2398594152	The changes of kernel nutritive components and seed vigor in F1 seeds of sh2 sweet corn during seed development stage were investigated and the relationships between them were analyzed by time series regression (TSR) analysis. The results show that total soluble sugar and reducing sugar contents gradually declined, while starch and soluble protein contents increased throughout the seed development stages. Germination percentage, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index gradually increased along with seed development and reached the highest levels at 38 d after pollination (DAP). The TSR showed that, during 14 to 42 DAP, total soluble sugar content was independent of the vigor parameters determined in present experiment, while the reducing sugar content had a significant effect on seed vigor. TSR equations between seed reducing sugar and seed vigor were also developed. There were negative correlations between the seed reducing sugar content and the germination percentage, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index, respectively. It is suggested that the seed germination, energy of germination, germination index and vigor index could be predicted by the content of reducing sugar in sweet corn seeds during seed development stages.

2398594335	TSC2 is a gene on chromosome 16p13.3 associated with the autosomal dominant neurocutaneous disorder, tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC). By using a partial nucleotide sequence from the cloned TSC2 and polymerase chain reaction methodology, we constructed a digoxigenin-labeled complementary DNA probe to examine TSC2 gene expression in autopsy- or biopsy-derived human tissues by in situ hybridization. TSC2 messenger RNA was widely expressed in various cell types throughout the body, including epithelia, lymphocytes, and cells with endocrine functions, e.g., adrenal cortex and anterior pituitary. It was prominently and selectively (within the central nervous system) expressed in pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex and other motor neurons, e.g., in spinal cord and brainstem nuclei. Visceral TSC2 expression was comparable in autopsy tissues from patients with and without TSC; TSC2 messenger RNA expression was most prominent in cells with a rapid mitotic rate and turnover, e.g., epithelia and lymphocytes, with central nervous system pyramidal cells and other neurons being an obvious exception, and/or in cells with important secretory/transport functions. This widespread expression of the TSC2 gene supports the view that it encodes a protein vital to cell growth and metabolism or one that functions as a tumor/growth suppressor.
2240726636	Despite the recent gains in malaria control, falciparum malaria still causes an estimated 198 million cases globally and kills 0.58 million patients each year [1]. Once severe disease develops, the case-fatality rate is around 8% in children and 15% in adults despite optimal antimalarial treatment with artesunate [2]. A better understanding of the underlying pathophysiology is critical for developing adjunctive treatments to lower morality.  Lactic acidosis is a common complication of severe malaria, which has a strong predictive value for death in both pediatric and adult patients [3, 4]. Lactate accounts for approximately one fourth of the strong acids [5] present in severe malaria. The high lactate to pyruvate ratios in severe malaria indicate that anaerobic glycolysis most likely results from microcirculatory hypoperfusion [6]. Impairment of tissue microcirculatory flow is caused by the sequestration of cytoadherent red blood cells (RBCs) containing mature forms of the malaria parasite [7–9]. Rosetting, autoagglutination, and endothelial cell dysfunction may further compromise microcirculatory flow [10, 11]. Reduced uninfected RBC deformability (RCD) is thought to be an additional contributing factor [10, 12]. Other causes include circulatory shock and severe anemia, compromising oxygen delivery.  The relative contributions of these factors to lactic acidosis have not been well established. In this prospective study of adults hospitalized with falciparum malaria, we measured the plasma P. falciparum histidine-rich protein 2 (HRP2) concentration as a proxy measure for the total and sequestered parasite biomass [13], RCD, and other established contributors to lactic acidosis and assessed their relative associations with plasma lactate concentrations.

2240726707	a b s t r a c t In this study the effect of acidification of the drinking water of broiler chickens on both direct and indirect transmission of Campylobacter was evaluated. In the direct transmission experiment both susceptible and inoculated animals were housed together. In the indi- rect transmission experiment the susceptible animals were spatially separated from the inoculated animals and no direct animal to animal contact was possible. The transmission parameterwas estimated for the groups supplied with acidified drinking water and for the control groups. The results showed that acidification of the drinking water had no effect on direct transmission (ˇ = 3.7 day−1 for both control and treatment). Indirect transmis- sion however was influenced by acidification of the drinking water. A significant decrease in transmission was observed (p < 0.05), with control vs. treatment point estimates being ˇ = 0.075 day −1 vs. ˇ = 0.011 day −1 .

2240726785	An assay method suitable for use in microarray hybridization of a target sample can include providing a microarray having probes, hybridizing the probes to a target sample and random primers each having an arbitrary sequence, ligating a free terminal of each of the probes to one end of each of the random primers in the probe side, removing the target sample hybridized to each of the probes, and measuring the intensity of the remaining random primers.
2240726860	Discovery of cryptic species using molecular tools has become common in many animal groups but it is rarely accompanied by morphological revision, creating ongoing problems in taxonomy and conservation. In copepods, cryptic species have been discovered in most groups where fast-evolving molecular markers were employed. In this study at Yeelirrie in Western Australia we investigate a subterranean species complex belonging to the harpacticoid genus Schizopera Sars, 1905, using both the barcoding mitochondrial COI gene and landmark-based two-dimensional geometric morphometrics. Integumental organs (sensilla and pores) are used as landmarks for the first time in any crustacean group. Complete congruence between DNA-based species delimitation and relative position of integumental organs in two independent morphological structures suggests the existence of three distinct evolutionary units. We describe two of them as new species, employing a condensed taxonomic format appropriate for cryptic species. We argue that many supposedly cryptic species might not be cryptic if researchers focus on analyzing morphological structures with multivariate tools that explicitly take into account geometry of the phenotype. A perceived supremacy of molecular methods in detecting cryptic species is in our view a consequence of disparity of investment and unexploited recent advancements in morphometrics among taxonomists. Our study shows that morphometric data alone could be used to find diagnostic morphological traits and gives hope to anyone studying small animals with a hard integument or shell, especially opening the door to assessing fossil diversity and rich museum collections. We expect that simultaneous use of molecular tools with geometry-oriented morphometrics may yield faster formal description of species. Decrypted species in this study are a good example for urgency of formal descriptions, as they display short-range endemism in small groundwater calcrete aquifers in a paleochannel, where their conservation may be threatened by proposed mining.
2240727092	The construction of eight large weirs in the Nakdong River, Korea, caused a decrease in the water flow velocity and several physical changes to the water environment. Here, changes in phyto- and zooplankton communities and water quality in the areas near the eight weirs were investigated from 2011 to 2013, and relationships between phytoplankton abundances and environmental factors were analyzed. Special emphasis was given to the succession patterns in algal abundance based on temperature fluctuations. At the eight weirs, 24 dominant species were found. The most abundant phytoplankton species was Stephanodiscus sp. (39.4% of dominant frequency). Cyanobacteria of the genus Microcystis dominated during the summer, with an dominant frequency of 8.5% and cell abundance ratio of 36.6%. Significant correlations were observed between temperature and abundance of eight of the main dominant species; seven species showed positive correlations with temperature. Stephanodiscus sp., however, showed a negative correlation with temperature (r=-0.26, p.0.01). In addition, this species showed a significant negative correlation with the dominant algal species-Aulacoseira granulata and Aphanizomenon flos-aquae, with the zooplankton Copepoda and with Cladocera. On the contrary, seven other dominant species of algae showed significant positive correlations with zooplankton. Thus, we showed that the seasonal succession of plankton communities in the Nakdong River was related to the water temperature changes.

Methods of diagnosing gastrointestinal disorders are also provided.
2398594658	The expression of the proto-oncogene c-myc has been strongly implicated in the regulation of apoptosis. Since we have previously shown apoptosis to occur in HL-60 leukemic cells exposed to the prodrug Mafosfamide (ASTA Z 7557), the present study was undertaken to examine the levels of c-myc mRNA transcripts in such cells. Mafosfamide, which is a cyclophosphamide derivative that rapidly generates 4-Hydroperoxycyclophosphamide after aqueous dissolution, was employed in doses ranging from 0.1 to 20 micrograms/ml. No changes in c-myc mRNA levels were evident after 1 hour of exposure to Mafosfamide. After 6 and 24 hours of Mafosfamide-exposure, however, there was a dose- and time-dependent decrease in c-myc transcripts. c-myc mRNA expression was reduced to a greater extent than was either beta-actin of GAPDH expression. Morphological, biochemical and ultrastructural evidence of apoptosis accompanied the Mafosfamide-induced c-myc mRNA down-regulation at 24 hours. We conclude that, in the context of Mafosfamide-treated HL-60 cells, upregulation of c-myc mRNA transcription was not fundamental for the activation of the apoptotic cascade.
2398594976	epithelia abolished the cell’s ability to respond to stressors adequately (Fig 2, G). To test whether the assumption that ORMDL overexpression impairs epithelial repair thus promoting the development toward an asthmatic phenotype, we performed a simple wound repair assay using cultured human lung epithelial cells (BEAS-2B). This scratch assay was performed with control BEAS-2B cells (transfected with an empty vector) and those transfected with an ORMDL3 overexpression vector (Fig 2, H). The wound repair assay demonstrated that ORMDL3-overexpressing BEAS-2B cellsshow adelay inwound closure, implying that their repair capacity is reduced. In conclusion, we found that increased epithelial ORMDL expression, which mimics the situation found in carriers of the risk allele, changes cellular response characteristics in a way that promote asthma development. ORMDL overexpression changes 1) terminal airway structures, 2) increases the susceptibility to stressors such as CS and hypoxia, 3) abolishes the airway epithelial’s ability to react adequately to stressors, and 4) reduces the repair capacities of the epithelium substantially. We hypothesize that these ORMDL overexpression-induced changes are of central importance for the observed phenotypes that collectively lead to an increased susceptibility to acquire asthma.
2398594978	Reasons for the decline of the Mariana Crow (Corvus kubaryi) on the Western Pacific island of Rota are currently unknown, but a need to protect nesting habitat has been suggested. We examined 55 actual nest sites and 60 random sites from 1997 to 1999 to investigate habitat characteristics specific to crow nest sites. Both nests and random plots were predominantly in limestone forest habitat. Discriminant function analyses indicate actual nest sites were differentiated from random sites based on a higher percentage of canopy cover and mean DBH of papaya (Carica papaya) and woody vines, as well as a higher stem count of species associated with limestone forests. This resulted in correct classification of a potential site as nesting versus random in 92% of the cases. Actual nests were >300 m from buildings, while random sites averaged (± SE) 226.7 ± 71.6 m from a building. Actual nest sites were about twice as far from a road as random nest sites. Twenty-eight of the 55 active nests fledged young. Nests in native forests were associated with higher reproductive success than nests in more disturbed areas. These findings suggest that damage to habitat from anthropogenic or natural causes may be limiting nesting success. Received 19 February 2010. Accepted 22 November 2010.
2398595027	Early weaning of piglets can lead to an increase in belly-nosing and other oral-nasal behavior (nosing, chewing, or sucking other piglets), but the causative factors involved in these behavior patterns are largely unknown. Because these behavior patterns resemble massaging the udder and sucking, they may be associated with feeding. The objectives of this study were to determine any effect of diet quality or the presence of milk in the diet on belly-nosing behavior of piglets weaned at 14 to 18 d. During the first 2 wk after weaning, piglets were fed diets differing in quality and inclusion of milk products. Six replicates of eight piglets per replicate, blocked by initial body weight, (n = 192) were offered one of four dietary treatments: HQM: high quality, high in milk products; HQ: high quality, no milk products; PQ: poor quality, no milk products; HQ+MR: high quality, no milk products (as HQ) sprayed with milk replacer five times daily. Thereafter, the piglets were fed a standard nursery diet. Feed intake was measured daily for wk 1 and again at the end of wk 2. Behavior was recorded every 5 min during two 4-h periods on d 2 to 7, 10, 14, 17 and 21 after weaning. Dietary treatment influenced ADFI and ADG during wk 1. Average daily feed intake (P 0.10) and ADG (P > 0.10) were the same across all treatments. Overall, ADFI was not influenced by the inclusion of milk products in the diet or the addition of milk replacer (P > 0.10); however, ADG was. Piglets on HQM had higher ADG than those on HQ during wk 2 (P 0.10). Although the dietary treatments did affect ADFI and ADG, there were no effects on any behavior pattern recorded, including time spent at the feeder (P > 0.10). Lower weight-for-age piglets performed more oral-nasal behavior, in total, than higher weight-for-age piglets (P < 0.03). Neither feeding a poor-quality diet nor the presence of milk in the diet had an effect on belly-nosing or other oral-nasal behavior patterns during the first 3 wk after weaning. Belly-nosing does not seem to be associated with feeding.
2398595121	Fluconazole is a triazole antifungal compound suitable for the treatment of fungal infections, including those caused by Candida albicans. Fluconazole, as all azole antifungals, is a potent inhibitor of ergosterol biosynthesis. The aims of this study are to evaluate the susceptibility of C. albicans strains isolated from clinical specimens against fluconazole, and to assess the decrease in ergosterol produced on these strains when they are incubated in vitro with this antifungal compound. Sixty six yeast strains were isolated and identified from vaginal specimens of 710 women of a tocogynecology surgery (9.3%), C. albicans being the most frequent species (n = 52, ca. 79%). An agar dilution technique was used to determine the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of fluconazole for the C. albicans strains. The MICs rank was between 1 and 20 micrograms/ml (mean = 6.6 micrograms/ml). Ergosterol content from ten C. albicans strains (MIC for fluconazole = 5 micrograms/ml) was assessed using the method proposed by Breivik and Owades, with three concentrations of fluconazole (2.5, 5 and 20 micrograms/ml) and four contact times (1, 6, 12 and 24 h), in comparison to no treated strains (control). The mean content of ergosterol was lower in the treated strains than in the control ones, and became statistically significant after 12 h of incubation.

2240727661	Gaining insights into the biology of human stem cells and into the early embryonic development opens new avenues for generating tissue-specific cells from embryonic stem cells or other pluripotent stem cell sources. With respect to metabolic liver diseases, recent advances in understanding endodermal specification during gastrulation of the post-implantation embryo and in understanding the formation of the hepato-biliary system have strong impact on improved protocols to generate stem cell-derived hepatic cells. The landmark studies from Shinya Yamanaka and co-workers opened a new era in stem cell biology, by providing a technology that allows the generation of pluripotent stem cells from patients’ cells and, thus, allowing the generation of disease-specific stem cells. Taken together these two major advances in the field of stem cell biology, new approaches for studying metabolic liver diseases in correlation to individual patient’s symptoms are available, which provide a breakthrough in new drug target research or individual gene-therapeutic therapies.
2240727898	A single point mutation in the human lipoprotein lipase gene which results in an A → G nucleotide change at codon 291 (nucleotide 1127) of the lipoprotein lipase gene, and a substitution of serine for the normal asparagine in the lipoprotein lipase gene product is seen with increased frequency in patients with coronary artery disease, and is associated with an increased susceptibility to coronary artery disease, including in particular premature atherosclerosis. This is expressed as a diminished catalytic activity of lipoprotein lipase, lower HDL-cholesterol levels and higher triglyceride levels. Thus, susceptibility of a human individual to premature atherosclerosis can be evaluated by: (a) obtaining a sample of DNA from the individual; and (b) evaluating the sample of DNA for the presence of nucleotides encoding a serin residue as amino acid 291 of the lipoprotein lipase gene product. Patients found to be suffering from or likely to suffer from premature atherosclerosis and other forms of coronary artery disease as a result of a lipoprotein lipase deficiency can be treated using gene therapy.
2240728034	Thrombin is a multifunctional serine protease which plays a central role in blood coagulation. It has also been implicated in fibroproliferative disorders where it induces migration and proliferation of mesenchymal cells. Stimulation of these processes occurs via activation of PAR-1 (protease activated receptor -1). In this study we have used antisense oligonucleotides (CCCCATTGTCCCGGGCTCTG) to the PAR-1 thrombin receptor in an attempt to down-regulate PAR-1 expression and inhibit thrombin-induced fibroblast proliferation. Antisense oligonucleotides were delivered to the cells alone or complexed with lipofectin and an integrin-targetting peptide (peptide 6, [K]GACRRETAWACG), based on an αβ-specific peptide. Proliferation of human foetal lung fibroblasts (HFL-1) was assessed spectrophotometrically based on the uptake and elution of methylene blue. Thrombin (25nM) stimulated fibroblast proliferation by 54%±8% compared with cells grown in media alone. Antisense oligonucleotides at concentrations of up to 10μM alone failed to inhibit thrombin induced proliferation. However, oligonucleotides at 1μM complexed with lipofectin and an αβ integrin-targetting peptide inhibited thrombin-induced fibroblast proliferation by 76%±12% (p<0.01). Transfection with the oligonucleotide complex did not affect proliferation of fibroblasts grown in media alone. Inhibition of thrombin receptor expression may therefore provide a method of inhibiting thrombin mediated cellular effects without affecting haemostasis. These data suggest that antisense oligonucleotides to PAR-1 may be useful as antifibrotic therapies.
2240728159	Provided are proteins capable of activating NF-κB, which are used for diagnosing, treating or preventing diseases associated with the excessive activation or inhibition of NF-κB. Using plasmid pNFκB-Luc, cDNA encoding a protein capable of activating NF-κB has been cloned from a cDNA library constructed from human lung fibroblasts and the like, and the DNA sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence determined. The protein, the DNA encoding the protein, a recombinant vector containing the DNA, and a transformant containing the recombinant vector are useful for screening a substance inhibiting or promoting NF-κB activation.
2240728250	The vertical movements of a teleostean fish may be restricted by the presence of the swimbladder, which will increase or decrease in volume when the fish moves up or down in the water. It is shown that the restriction that the swimbladder imposes to vertical movements involving a reduction in pressure will depend on physical factors such as (1) The resistance that the bladder and body wall offer to the expansion of the bladder gas. (2) The percentage volume of the swimbladder and the density change of the fish when it is subjected to a reduction in pressure. (3) The pressure reduction that leads to the rupture of the bladder wall. A distinction is made between rapid and slow movements. In the former the compensatory ability of the fish must be considered and in the latter the speed with which the fish can accommodate itself to pressure changes. An equation is derived from which the minimum speed at which a physoclist can migrate from deep to shallow water can be calculated. To solve the equation two factors must be determined experimentally. Various experiments are described which were made on the perch, Perca fluviatilis , the wrasse, Crenilabrus melops , the rockling, Onos mustela and the dragonet, Callionymus lyra . The results showed that there was a relation between the relative size of the swimbladder and the change in the density of a fish when it is subjected to a reduction in pressure; that the bladder and body wall of the perch offer little resistance to the expansion of the bladder gas; and that the danger of the bladder wall rupturing might restrict the extent of rapid movements made by the perch. Experiments on the restriction that the swimbladder imposes to the rapid and slow vertical movements of the perch will be described in a following paper.

2398595433	Photosynthesis is the process that keeps algae alive.  In our lab, we set out to answer whether or not changing white light for red light would affect the growth of the algae. We tested four samples of algae in red light and one sample of white light over a three week period and measured the cell density in weekly increments. We found some evidence that algae use multiple wavelengths of light in photosynthesis, and that optimal growth does not occur under red light alone. The cell density of the samples under red light from week one to week two was minimal, showing only a small increase in cell density.  Week two to week three showed next to no growth.
2398595473	A rice hybrid designated XL730 is disclosed. The invention relates to the seeds of rice hybrid XL730, to the plants of rice hybrid XL730 and to methods for producing a rice plant produced by crossing the hybrid XL730 with itself or another rice plant.

2398595503	The present immunohistochemical studies used polyclonal antibodies specific to epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor-alpha (TGF-alpha), and monoclonal antibodies to the extracellular binding domain of EGF receptor to elucidate their presence and cellular distribution in surgically induced endometriosis in the rat. Uterine segments were implanted in the mesenteric region adjacent to a blood vessel for a period of 4-6 weeks. During operative reexploration, the implanted tissues were intact, morphologically similar to the controls, and consisted of a cyst containing clear fluid and associated adhesion formation. All the uterine cell types immunostained with antibody to EGF. The highest immunostaining intensity was associated with inflammatory cells infiltrated among endometrial stromal cells, followed by luminal and glandular epithelial and stromal cells. The cysts consisted of an inner simple columnar epithelium, surrounded by several layers of smooth muscle and connective tissue. The cyst epithelial layer immunostained weakly, while the supporting wall stained moderately. The inflammatory cells found within the cyst cavity immunostained very intensely, comparable to those in the endometrium. The patterns of immunostaining for TGF-alpha and EGF receptor were similar to that observed for EGF. Myometrial smooth-muscle cells and endothelial and smooth-muscle cells of arterioles were also immunostained for EGF, TGF-alpha, and EGF receptor, but with lower intensity than that of the endometrium. These observations suggest that, like normal uterine tissue, endometrial implants produce EGF and TGF-alpha locally and contain receptors for EGF. These results imply a possible paracrine or autocrine role for growth factors in the establishment and/or maintenance of endometriotic tissue.
2398595763	Monoclonal antibodies were used to immunocytochemically demonstrate the presence or absence of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in smear preparations from human intracranial tumors. The results show that this approach may be of great help in the histogenetic classification of such tumors.
2398595792	Severe deformities of the hind limb skeleton such as shortening, abnormal curvatures, terminal expansions, curled toes and joint dislocations were produced in frog tadpoles by the osteolathyrogenic principle. Gross-anatomical features of the deformed skeleton and of the respective nervous trunks were studied in specimens cleared according to WILLIAMS' technique. The findings support the previously suggested osteo-neural concept: Experimental skeletal deformities represent adaptations of the bone growth at the organ level to the inadequate extensive growth of the nervous trunks. The neural growth appears to be more severely affected by the teratogen than the bone growth proper.
2398595952	Two experiments were conducted to evaluate alpha-tocopherol accumulation in muscle of lambs finished on pasture or concentrates. The objective for Exp. 1 was to compare accumulation of alpha-tocopherol in the longissimus muscle of pasture-fed lambs to that of lambs fed three concentrations (15, 150, and 300 IU/kg of DM) of supplemental vitamin E (all rac alpha-tocopheryl acetate) in all-concentrate diets. The objective in Exp. 2 was to investigate the effect of duration of supplemental vitamin E feeding on alpha-tocopherol content and color change during display case storage of lamb muscle. Treatments evaluated in Exp. 2 were: 15 IU of supplemental vitamin E/kg DM fed to finish; 15 IU/kg followed by 300 IU/kg of DM during the last 21 d; and 15 IU/kg DM until 7 d prior to finish, then 300 IU/kg DM. In Exp. 1, alpha-tocopherol concentration of rotational grazed alfalfa and perennial ryegrass averaged 137 and 169 mg/kg of DM. Vitamin E treatments for lambs fed concentrate diets did not affect ADG (P > 0.15), but ADG was greater (P 0.50) alpha-tocopherol concentrations, and those concentrations were similar to values obtained when the concentrate diet supplemented with 150 IU of vitamin E/kg was fed. In Exp. 2, no differences (P > 0.10) in ADG were observed. Concentrations of longissimus alpha-tocopherol were highest when 300 IU supplemental vitamin E was fed for 21 d prior to slaughter. During a 6-d display period, semimembranosus steaks from lambs fed 300 IU of supplemental vitamin E/kg for either 7 or 21 d had higher a* and b* color readings than steaks from lambs fed 15 IU/kg of supplemental vitamin E. Increased consumption of vitamin E either via pasture or supplementation results in higher alpha-tocopherol concentrations in meat.

2398596543	The author analysis a number of studies of Soviet and foreign investigators demonstrating the presence of natural anti-tissue antibodies in healthy human and animals. A large number of these antibodies appear during and they occur more frequently and in larger amounts in females than in males. The physiological function of these antibodies which influence the permeability of tissues, their metabolism and their role in the removal and neutralization of the products of cell disintegration and metabolism, are discussed. Emphasis is laid on the participation of normal autoantibodies in the resistance of the organism of tumours and to radiation, discovered in the last few years. The studies dealing with the detection of activators--inductors of normal autoantibodies and with the role of their effect in specific immune response are mentioned. Thus the review elucidates the theoretical and practical perspectives of exploring this new trend in immunology.
2398596576	The evolution of antibiotic-resistant in bacteria has aggravated curiosity in development of alternative therapy to conventional drugs. One of the emerging drugs that can be used alternative to antibiotics is bacteriophage therapy. The use of living phages in the cure of lethal infectious life threatening diseases caused by Gram positive and Gram negative bacteria has been reported. Another development in the field of bacteriophage therapy is the use of genetically modified and non replicating phages in the treatment of bacterial infection. Genetically engineered bacteriophages can be used as adjuvant along with antibiotic therapy. Phages encoded with lysosomal enzymes are also effectual in the treatment of infectious diseases.
2398596628	The collection of eight rat and mouse hybridomas secreting the high affinity monoclonal antibodies to glycoprotein E1 of the Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis has been obtained. The antigenic structure of E1 protein has been studied with the use of these antibodies for the strains Trinidad, TC-83 and 230 of the virus. Antigenic map of glycoprotein E1 based on competition radioimmunoanalysis is proposed. Five sites are mapped including eight epitopes binding monoclonal antibodies. Antibodies to sites E1-1, E1-3 and E1-5 are crossreactive in interaction with the virus of Venezuelan equine encephalomyelitis, while antibodies to site E1-5 interact also with the virus of tick-borne encephalitis. Antibodies to site E1-1 possess the protective effect and lack the neutralizing effect in tissue cultures. Antibodies to all sites of E1 protein are devoid of ability to neutralize the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus.
2398596670	In an attempt to induce aplasia of the bone marrow, to several strains of inbred SPF mice Mylecytan Spofa was administered. Evidence was provided that basically two groups can be differentiated: Mylecytan-resistant (C57 Black/ 10, ICR and F1 hybrid (Aph X C57 Black/ 10) and Mylecytan sensitive (CBA, C3H and Aph) strains. This fact should be taken into consideration in the interpretation of results of investigations evaluating the action of cytostatic preparations as well as when studying other relationships such as e. g. the aetiopathogenesis of aplasia of the bone marrow, etc.
2398596703	The impact of Pseudoalteromonas nigrifaciens KMM 156 lipopolysaccharide and its fragments on adhesion of prokaryote and eukaryote cells was studied. The lipopolysaccharide and O-specific polysaccharide identical by its structure to capsular polysaccharide lowered the number of the Yersinia pseudotuberculosis bacteria attached to sheep erythrocytes and adhesion of mouse neutrophils to plastic. The kora oligosaccharide had no effect on the processes.

2398596756	The effect of phagocytosis on lectin bind- ing to plasma membranes of polymorphonuclear leuko- cytes was examined. The specific activities of binding sites of concanavalin A and Ricinus communis agglutinin (defined as gg of lectin bound per 100 pg of membrane protein) were measured on isolated membranes; they decreased in parallel with phagocytosis. Our data suggest that this removal occurs by concentration of binding sites into internalized membrane. Colchicine and vinblastine, which did not inhibit phagocytosis, prevented the selective removal of lectin-binding sites from the surface. It was also shown that at 37 lectins induce their own internaliza- tion. This property was used to define operationally three classes of lectin receptors, one of which is most extensively removed from plasma membrane during phagocytosis. Based on other morphological studies in which it is shown that before phagocytosis the surface distribution of con- canavalin-binding sites is random, it is inferred that phagocytosis alters surface topography by inducing the selective movement of binding sites into membrane under- going internalization and that colchicine-sensitive pro- teins are essential for this imposed topographical re- organization.

2398597032	[Objective] The study was to isolate and identify the pathogen of Pandora neoaphidis and to determine its pathogenicity against turnip aphid (Lipaphis erysimi).[Method] Based on the morphological characteristics,the species of pathogenic fungus was identified.Spore shower method was used to carry out bioassay on the pathogen against turnip aphid.[Result] Primary conidia were ovoid,bitunicate and uninucleate,(24.7±1.4)μm×(10.7±0.9)μm,L/D=2.3±0.2.Secondary conidia had the similar shape with the primary ones,(18.6±2.1)μm×(13.3±1.3)μm,L/D=1.4±0.2.Hyphal body was like mycelium with the diameter of (10.6±0.8)μm.Conidiophores had palmate branch with the diameter of (10.0±0.9)μm.Pseudocystidia was not branched,which had rough base with the diameter of (19.2±1.7)μm,and gradually became more angular towards the apex with the diameter of (8.0±0.9)μm at tips.Rhizoid was like monohyphal shape with the diameter of (21.0±3.0)μm at base,the terminal apex had regular discoid holdfast.No resting spores were observed.The lethal dose of the pathogen against turnip aphid was 18.2/mm2.[Conclusion] The entomopathogenic fungus against turnip aphid was identified to be Pandora neoaphidis,and the pathogen was confirmed to have strong pathogenicity against turnip aphid.
2398597208	Calves experimentally infected with Nematodirus helvetianus were treated with a single dose of fenbendazole at the rate of 5 mg/kg of body weight. Fenbendazole was found to have an efficacy of 97.4% against adult N helvetianus. Additionally, eggs recovered 12 hours after calves were given the anthelmintic had fewer and frequently abnormal blastomeres. Fewer eggs were evident at 36 hours after treatment, and none was found at 72 hours or later. On the culturing of eggs from manure passed at 12 hours and later, almost no larval stages developed.
2398597336	OBJECTIVE To study the effect of lutein on relieving oxidative stress in the liver of mice induced by D-galactose(D-gal). METHODS Forty eight Kunming strain mice were randomized into 4 groups: model group, low lutein group (LL 10 mg/(kg x d)), high lutein group (HL 40 mg/(kg x d)) and normal control group. The content of reactive oxygen species (ROS), nitric oxide (NO) and activity of total nitric oxide synthase (TNOS), inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and mitochondrial Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, Ca(2+)-ATPase in liver tissue were detected 6 weeks later in the experiment. The expression of toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) mRNA and hemeoxygenase-1 (HO-1) mRNA in hepatic tissue were detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) technique. RESULTS ROS content in HL and LL group was significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that in the model group. The activity of Na(+)- K(+)-ATPase in HL and LL group and the activity of Ca(2+)-ATPase in HL group were significantly higher than that in the model group (P < 0.05). The activities of TNOS and iNOS and the content of NO in HL group were significantly lower than the model group (P < 0.05). The expression of HO-1 mRNA in HL group was significantly higher than that in the model group, but the expression of TLR4 mRNA in HL group was significantly lower than that in the model group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION The mechanism of lutein on the protection of mice from oxidative stress induced by D-gal might be related to increasing the expression of HO-1 mRNA and reducing the expression of TLR4 mRNA.

2398597424	Using CRISPR/Cas9, diverse genomic elements may be studied in their endogenous context. Pairs of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) are used to delete regulatory elements and small RNA genes, while longer RNAs can be silenced through promoter deletion. We here present CRISPETa, a bioinformatic pipeline for flexible and scalable paired sgRNA design based on an empirical scoring model. Multiple sgRNA pairs are returned for each target. Any number of targets can be analyzed in parallel, making CRISPETa equally appropriate for studies of individual elements, or complex library screens. Fast run-times are achieved using a precomputed off-target database. sgRNA pair designs are output in a convenient format for visualisation and oligonucleotide ordering. We present a series of pre-designed, high-coverage library designs for entire classes of non-coding elements in human, mouse, zebrafish, Drosophila and C. elegans. Using an improved version of the DECKO deletion vector, together with a quantitative deletion assay, we test CRISPETa designs by deleting an enhancer and exonic fragment of the MALAT1 oncogene. These achieve efficiencies of ≥50%, resulting in production of mutant RNA. CRISPETa will be useful for researchers seeking to harness CRISPR for targeted genomic deletion, in a variety of model organisms, from single-target to high-throughput scales.
2398597437	Despite the many efforts made by the scientific community in the development of vaccine candidates against dengue virus (DENV), no vaccine has been licensed up to date. Although the immunopathogenesis associated to the disease is a key factor to take into account by vaccine developers, the lack of animal models that reproduce the clinical signs of the disease has hampered the vaccine progress. Non-human primates support viral replication, but they are very expensive and do not show signs of disease. Immunocompromised mice develop viremia and some signs of the disease; however, they are not valuable for vaccine testing. Nowadays, immunocompetent mice are the most used model to evaluate the immunogenicity of vaccine candidates. These animals are resistant to DENV infection; therefore, the intracranial inoculation with neuroadapted virus, which provokes viral encephalitis, represents an alternative to evaluate the protective capacity of vaccine candidates. Previous results have demonstrated the crucial role of cellular immune response in the protection induced by the virus and vaccine candidates in this mouse encephalitis model. However, in the present work we are proposing that the magnitude of the cell-mediated immunity and the inflammatory response generated by the vaccine can modulate the survival rate after viral challenge. We observed that the intracranial challenge of naive mice with DENV-2 induces the recruitment of immune cells that contribute to the reduction of viral load, but does not increase the survival rate. On the contrary, animals treated with cyclophosphamide, an immunosuppressive drug that affects proliferating lymphocytes, had a higher viral load but a better survival rate than untreated animals. These results suggest that the immune system is playing an immunopathogenic role in this model and the survival rate may not be a suitable endpoint in the evaluation of vaccine candidates based on antigens that induce a strong cellular immune response.
2240730500	The invention discloses polypeptides (Unc-51 kinase, ROMA1, and/or 2TM protein) affecting the activity of Uncoupling Proteins (UCPs), thereby leading to an altered mitochondrial activity and thus contributing to membrane stability and/or function of organelles, preferably mitochondria. This invention relates to the use of these polypepetides in the diagnosis, study, prevention, and treatment of diseases and disorders, for example, but not limited to, metabolic diseases such as obesity, adipositas, eating disorders, wasting syndromes (cachexia), pancreatic dysfunctions (for example diabetes), disorders related to ROS production, and others.
2240730501	We have recently demonstrated that the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp160 enhances the in vitro differentiation of hematopoietic myeloid progenitor cells derived from cord blood by inducing secretion of colony-stimulating factor(s) (CSF) in T cells, presumably through the interaction of gp160 with CD4 molecules. In this study, we investigated the gp 160-induced humoral CSFs in cord blood by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and by polymerase chain reaction on reverse-transcribed mRNA (RT-PCR). We demonstrate that gp160 can induce interleukin (IL)-3, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage CSF (GM-CSF) protein secretion only in purified cord-blood T cells (CB-T) and not in detectable amounts in whole cord blood cells (WCB); cytokine mRNA induction occurred in purified CB-T and WCB, but was significantly greater in the former. Treatment of gp160 with soluble CD4 (sCD4) abolished the secretion of all three cytokines in CB-T cells, which suggests that interaction of gp160 with CD4 molecules is required for the secretion of these cytokines from CB- T cells. However, in WCB cells, sCD4 treatment of gp160 resulted in inhibition of only IL-3 and GM-CSF mRNA, whereas IL-6 secretion was enhanced. Purified cord-blood monocytes secreted only IL-6 in response to gp160, and the gp160-induced IL-6 secretion by monocytes was also further increased by gp160 + sCD4 complex. Furthermore, monocyte culture supernatants suppressed gp160-induced IL-3 secretion from CB-T cells. These findings indicate that (1) CB-T cells are a potent source of gp160-induced hematopoietic cytokines, and (2) that different mechanisms are involved in the induction of IL-6 by gp160 in the T- and non-T-cell fractions of cord blood. The ability of HIV gp160 to induce hematopoietic CSFs in cord blood may be important in HIV pathogenesis.
2240730658	The present Invention provides subtelomeric probes and primer paus which can be used to develop subtelomeric probes as well as methods of making and using the same.

2240731094	Yellow mite [Polyphagotarsonemus latus (Banks)], semilooper (Anomis sabulifera Guen.) and stem weevil (Apion corchori Marshall) are major economic pests of cultivated jute (Corchorus spp.). Eighty accessions of Corchorus species were evaluated under field infestation, in an augmented randomized block design, against Yellow mite, semilooper and stem weevil. Based on the damage caused by these pests, accessions WCIN-009, WCIN-006, NYM2860 (C. aestuans); WCIJ-116 (C. fascicularis); WCIJ-009, KBA-230 (C. tridens); WCIJ-031 (C. pseudo-capsularis); WCIJ-121 and WCIJ-132 (C. trjlocularis) were identified as moderately resistant against one or more of these three pests. It was also found that none of the accessions evaluated showed high level of resistance against all the three pests together. Further studies under greenhouse/artificial infestation conditions are required to substantiate the results.
2398597612	Investigation was undertaken to study the efficacy of TCM 199 and MEM media in the process of oocyte maturation and fertilization after harvesting the oocytes from slaughtered cow and heifer ovaries by aspiration and mincing techniques. Out of 354 number of ovaries, mincing method could yield 1.35 (50.98%) of good quality oocytes per ovary as comparison to 0.61 (55.45%) by aspiration method. The TCM 199 and MEM could record the maturation of 85.71% and 60.26% of oocytes and the rate of sperm penetration was higher in TCM 199 matured oocytes (97.21%) as compared to MEM matured ones (74.46%). The staining of oocytes by aceto-orcein stain was also employed.
2398597678	The present invention relates to a kit for screening and establishing optimal amplification condition for individual PCR using a dried-formulated PCR reagent which is composed of different combinations of various components affecting PCR result, to provide a method for screening and establishment of optimal amplification in PCR constructed with a dried-formulated PCR reagent. According to the present invention, researchers can perform PCR under the optimal amplification conditions appropriate for individual PCR even with a PCR-related product constructed from a dried-formulated PCR reagent, suggesting that a unique target gene can be efficiently amplified by PCR constructed with a dried-formulated PCR reagent under the more appropriate conditions.
2398597703	Observations of inherited phenotypes that cannot be explained solely through genetic inheritance are increasing. Evidence points to transmission of non-DNA molecules in the gamete as mediators of the phenotypes. However, in most cases it is unclear what the molecules are, with DNA methylation, chromatin proteins, and small RNAs being the most prominent candidates. From a screen to generate novel mouse mutants of genes involved in epigenetic reprogramming, we produced a DNA methyl- transferase 3b allele that is missing exon 13. Mice that are homozygous for the mutant allele have smaller stature and reduced viability, with particularly high levels of female post-natal death. Reduced DNA methylation was also detected at telocentric repeats and the X-linked Hprt gene. However, none of the abnormal phenotypes or DNA methylation changes worsened with multiple generations of homozygous mutant inbreeding. This suggests that in our model the abnormalities are reset each generation and the processes of transgenerational epigenetic reprogram- ming are effective in preventing their inheritance.
2398597893	The CRISPR/Cas9 system has recently been used to confer molecular immunity against several eukaryotic viruses, including plant DNA geminiviruses. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of the efficiencies of targeting different coding and non-coding sequences in the genomes of multiple geminiviruses. Moreover, we analyze the ability of geminiviruses to evade the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery. Our results demonstrate that the CRISPR/Cas9 machinery can efficiently target coding and non-coding sequences and interfere with various geminiviruses. Furthermore, targeting the coding sequences of different geminiviruses resulted in the generation of viral variants capable of replication and systemic movement. By contrast, targeting the noncoding intergenic region sequences of geminiviruses resulted in interference, but with inefficient recovery of mutated viral variants, which thus limited the generation of variants capable of replication and movement. Taken together, our results indicate that targeting noncoding, intergenic sequences provides viral interference activity and significantly limits the generation of viral variants capable of replication and systemic infection, which is essential for developing durable resistance strategies for long-term virus control.
2398597897	A new and distinct variety of Ilex×meserveae is provided which originated by crossing Ilex aquifolium `Fructa Lutea`×Ilex rugosa. The new variety possesses attractive deep green foliage having a glossy upper surface, exhibits a dense branching pyramidal growth habit, and forms in abundance berries which when mature exhibit an attractive lemon-yellow coloration. Pistillate flowers are formed in abundance in the springtime and good tolerance to cold is exhibited in the wintertime. The new variety is particularly well suited for growing as a specimen plant which during the winter displays a striking contrast of bright yellow berries surrounded by a background of deep green foliage.
2398597901	Recent advances in genetic engineering have enabled the delivery of clinical trials using patient T cells redirected to recognize tumor-associated antigens. The most dramatic results have been seen with T cells engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) specific for CD19, a differentiation antigen expressed in B cells and B lineage malignancies. We propose that antigen expression in nonmalignant cells may contribute to the efficacy of T-cell therapy by maintaining effector function and promoting memory. Although CAR recognition is limited to cell surface structures, T-cell receptors (TCRs) can recognize intracellular proteins. This not only expands the range of tumor-associated self-antigens that are amenable for T-cell therapy, but also allows TCR targeting of the cancer mutagenome. We will highlight biological bottlenecks that potentially limit mutation-specific T-cell therapy and may require high-avidity TCRs that are capable of activating effector function when the concentrations of mutant peptides are low. Unexpectedly, modified TCRs with artificially high affinities function poorly in response to low concentration of cognate peptide but pose an increased safety risk as they may respond optimally to cross-reactive peptides. Recent gene-editing tools, such as transcription activator–like effector nucleases and clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats, provide a platform to delete endogenous TCR and HLA genes, which removes alloreactivity and decreases immunogenicity of third-party T cells. This represents an important step toward generic off-the-shelf T-cell products that may be used in the future for the treatment of large numbers of patients.
2398598091	Increased interest toward traditional tomato varieties is fueled by the need to rescue desirable organoleptic traits and to improve the quality of fresh and processed tomatoes in the market. In addition, the phenotypic and genetic variation preserved in tomato landraces represents a means to understand the genetic basis of traits related to health and organoleptic aspects and improve them in modern varieties. To establish a framework for this approach, we studied the content of several metabolites in a panel of Italian tomato landraces categorized into three broad fruit type classes (flattened/ribbed, pear/oxheart, round/elongate). Three modern hybrids, corresponding to the three fruit shape typologies, were included as reference. Red ripe fruits were morphologically characterized and biochemically analyzed for their content in glycoalkaloids, phenols, amino acids, and Amadori products. The round/elongate types showed a higher content in glycoalkaloids, whereas flattened types had higher levels of phenolic compounds. Flattened tomatoes were also rich in total amino acids and in particular in glutamic acid. Multivariate analysis of amino acid content clearly separated the three classes of fruit types. Making allowance of the very low number of genotypes, phenotype-marker relationships were analyzed after retrieving single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) among the landraces available in the literature. Sixty-six markers were significantly associated with the studied traits. The positions of several of these SNPs showed correspondence with already described genomic regions and QTLs supporting the reliability of the association. Overall the data indicated that significant changes in quality-related metabolites occur depending on the genetic background in traditional tomato germplasm, frequently according to specific fruit shape categories. Such a variability is suitable to harness association mapping for metabolic quality traits using this germplasm as an experimental population, paving the way for investigating their genetic/molecular basis, and facilitating breeding for quality-related compounds in tomato fruits.
2240731568	The invention relates to a device to isolate foreign bodies in a tubular organ of a creature, for example in the ureter. Stone fragments can collect at a site in such an organ, for example fragments produced by crushing renal calculi with a lithotripter. In order to prevent such accumulations the invention provides an elongate element (10) provided with baffles (11).
2240731825	The relationship between initial population densities of Meloidogyne incognita race 1 and yield of susceptible and resistant tomato cultivars was investigated in the field. Microplots were infested with finely chopped nematode infected pepper roots to give a range of population densities of 0, 0.031, 0.062, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 or 128 eggs and juveniles/cm³ soil. A tolerance limit (T) of 0.55 eggs and juveniles of M. incognita/cm³ soil was calculated for both cultivars of tomato. A minimum relative yield (m) of 0 and 0.7 at initial population densities (Pi) = 32 eggs and juveniles/cm³ soil was also calculated for the susceptible and resistant tomato cultivar, respectively. Fruit size and marketable yield of tomato of the susceptible cultivar were negatively affected by the nematode infestation. Maximum nematode reproduction rate was 1,539 at the lowest Pi on the susceptible tomato but decreased with increasing nematode population density. Reproduction rate was lower that 1 at all initial population densities of M. incognita in microplots planted with the resistant tomato cultivar.
2398598218	Since it was discovered, twenty years ago, the glial fibrillary acidic protein has been the subject of more than 500 publications. The huge interest it has raised up is probably due partly to its abundance in the central nervous system and also, above all, to its cellular specificity which makes it the universally recognized marker of astrocytes. It has been used by biologists as a tool to follow the normal or pathological glia cell differentiation in animal models and human pathology, particularly in the fields of neuropathology and neuro-oncology.
2398598454	Cucullanus pinnai and Spinitectus jamundensis are cited parasitizing three freshwater fish species: Pimelodus albicans, Leporinus obtusidens and Prochilodus lineatus, captured in Termas de Rio Hondo pond, province of Santiago del Estero, Argentina, in 1992 and 1995. The three fish species were parasited by S. jamundensis, but C. pinnai was found only in P. albicans and L. obtusidens. Morphologic and morphometric parasitological studies were carried out. The specimens described were drawned. In addition, the following parasitic infection indexes were calculated: prevalence, mean and maximum intensity. The two nematode species identified are described for the first time in Argentina and increased the host range cited for the parasite species studied in this work.
2398598549	The IgG subclass distribution for both ANCA-specific, and total IgG subclasses, of sera from 48 patients with active systemic vasculitis was determined by solid-phase assay using monoclonal anti-human subclass reagents. To control for varying performance of the subclass reagents, the assays were calibrated with sera affinity-depleted into subclass specific fractions, whose ANCA IgG subclass distribution was determined by a common reagent. In 10 patients whose ANCA persisted during clinical remission, the ANCA IgG subclass distributions between active and remission phases of disease were compared. The total IgG subclass distribution of sera from patients with active vasculitis was similar to that found in a normal population. The ANCA IgG subclass distribution of the same sera showed relative enrichment for IgG3 and depletion of IgG2 (P less than 0.05). When the active and clinical remission ANCA IgG subclass distributions were compared, ANCA IgG3 levels had fallen and ANCA IgG2 levels were increased during remission (P less than 0.01).
2398598800	Twenty-five strains of Escherichia coli isolated from turkeys were characterized for their serum resistance and virulence. An in vitro bactericidal assay was used to determine the serum resistance of E coli. Virulence was determined by survival time after IV inoculation of each strain into 3-week-old turkeys. Serum-resistant E coli strains were generally found to be virulent for turkeys, whereas serum-sensitive E coli strains were avirulent. Of the 25 strains, 18 strains were placed in the 2 categories of serum-resistant/virulent and serum-sensitive/avirulent. Five strains were serum-resistant and avirulent, and 2 strains were serum-sensitive and virulent. Serum resistance appears to be an important determinant of virulence for E coli in turkeys; however, the requirement for other virulence factors, in addition to serum resistance, was suggested by the finding that 5 serum-resistant strains were avirulent in turkeys.
2398598814	Neospora caninum and Hammondia heydorni are two coccidian parasites withmorphologically similar oocysts in canine feces.It was recently proposed thatthey are one species.In this paper,we review the biology and morphology ofthese parasites and present evidence that N.caninumand H.heydorniareseparate species.
2398598896	The pattern of immunoglobulin (Ig) gene rearrangement and the genomic structure of the Myc locus were investigated in the DNA of 20 lymphnode biopsies of patients suffering from lymphoadenopathy-associated syndrome (LAS) and from 3 patients with Burkitt's lymphoma. Although polyclonality was the prevalent pattern of Ig gene rearrangement observed in LAS, in 30% of the cases discrete bands of Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement were identifiable due to the presence of monoclonal or oligoclonal cell populations. However, structural alterations of the Myc gene were not detected in any cases. As expected, in all three Burkitt's lymphomas studied, the lymphnode DNA displayed a clonal pattern of Ig heavy chain gene rearrangement. The Myc was altered in two cases, which presented a truncation of the gene beginning within a very short region of the first intron. By contrast, the breakpoint positions on chromosome 14 mapped in different regions of the Ig loci, which in both cases involved the switch (SH) area. Data confirm the relatively common occurrence of oligoclonal expansions within B cells in LAS and the frequent involvement of the Myc oncogene in the process of lymphomagenesis in individuals positive for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
2398598950	To evaluate whether pretreatment with prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) could desensitize pepsinogen secretion in chief cells from guinea pig, chief cells were pretreated with 10 microM PGE2 for up to 30 min. Desensitization of subsequent PGE2-stimulated secretion was maximal after 15 min, averaging only 29 +/- 9% (SE) of pepsinogen secretion in control cells stimulated with 10 microM PGE2. Desensitization was half-maximal with 30 nM PGE2. PGE2 pretreatment at 4 degrees C did not cause desensitization. In cells pretreated with 10 microM PGE2 for 15 min and then given 60 min to recover, responsiveness increased to 79 +/- 7% of that for control cells stimulated with PGE2. Thus the desensitization was reversible. Pretreatment with PGD2 and PGF2a did not alter subsequent PGE2-mediated secretion. PGE2-induced desensitization was heterologous but mediator specific because pepsinogen secretion was reduced in response to adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated agents (secretin and vasoactive intestinal peptide) but not Ca(2+)-mediated agents (CCK-8, gastrin, or carbachol). Pretreating chief cells with 10 microM PGE2 did not significantly alter cAMP generation in response to PGE2, secretin, or 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, suggesting that desensitization was not mediated by an alteration in the receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase system. Because PGE2 pretreatment also desensitized pepsinogen secretion induced by the synthetic cAMP analogues 8-BrcAMP and 2'-O-monobutyryl-8-BrcAMP, it is likely that the ability of PGE2 to desensitize pepsinogen secretion in chief cells isolated from guinea pig is due to a mechanism distal to generation of cAMP.
2240732682	"The analysis of the epidemiological situation regarding monithes cattle Aubrac breed in the Tyumen region from 2006 to 2012. Revealed two types of invasion by animals moniezy Moniezia benedeni and Moniezia expansa. Ekstensinvazirovannost animal pathogens monithes over the study period ranged from 1,2% (OOO ""Sloboda"", 2009 -2010). To 13,3 % (OOO ""Dankova"", 2011).

2240732989	Reports have shown an increased occurrence of bacterial infections due to the rapid development of multi-drug resistant strains of bacteria. In this regard, lots of efforts are being made to discover new drugs. Medicinal plants have played an important role in drug discovery. Multiple-plant herbal concoctions (multi-component herbal concoctions) are used as remedies in many cultures around the world. This is due to the advantages of synergism and low dosage of active principles compared with singleplant herbal remedies. An aqueous concoction obtained from a combination of leaves of Psidium. guajava, Acacia albidia and Ficus exasperata is used for the treatment of bacterial infections amongst many tribes in northern Ghana. In the present study, aqueous extracts of P. guajava, A. albidia and F. exasperata were screened separately for phytochemicals and their bacterial growth inhibitory activity evaluated in vitro using the agar diffusion method with Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhi as test organisms. The result was compared with that of an aqueous concoction obtained from a combination of the three plants (multicomponent concoction) to determine any indication of synergism or additive effect. Ciprofloxacin was used as control. Phytochemical screening of the extracts revealed the presence of phytochemicals with reported antimicrobial activities. All the extracts exhibited antibacterial activity with the multi-component extract demonstrating a superior antibacterial property against the test organisms at concentrations ranging between 1.0-5.0 mg/ml. The antibacterial activity of the multi-component concoction was statistically not significantly different from that of Ciporfloxacin (P = 0.87). There was no indication of synergism or additive effect in the multi-component concoction.
2240733029	Studies were made to determine the effect of initial inoculum levels (Pi) of Meloidogyne on Mentha arvensis cv. Gomti. There was a positive relationship between the initial inoculum levels of M. incognita and reduction in shoot-root/sucker fresh and dry weights, oil yield, total chlorophyll, total phenol and total sugar content of fresh leaves. The maximum reduction in corresponding parameters was recorded at the highest initial inoculum level (25,000 J2/5 kg soil) as compared to uninoculated control. There was a negative relationship between initial inoculum densities and rate of nematode multiplication. Maximum nematode final population Pf (1,33,430) and root-knot index (3.00) were observed at the highest Pi (25,000 J2/5 kg soil), whereas, maximum reproduction-factor was observed at minimum Pi (500 J2/5 kg soil).
2398599076	Western-Blotting technique and computer programme have been used to analyse cellular antigenic patterns of coagulase-negative staphylococci mainly of S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus species. It was shown that antigenic pattern among strains of one species was similar. Intra strains differences are mainly quantitative. The qualitative differences concern not quantitatively dominant antigens. The main antigens of S. epidermidis and S. saprophyticus strains were of 28 and 44 kD molecular weight respectively. The antigens of molecular weight around 44, 48, 89 and 105 kD were detected in antigenic extract of strains from different species. Only one of the quantitatively dominant antigen of m. w. 48 kD, was localised in all analysed materials. The method presented here was used for the first time to analyse staphylococcal antigens. Such analysis could be performed not only for bacterial antigens.
2398599299	In a survey in 2005 some symptoms were observed on three olive trees in a collection of different olive cultivars in one of the central provinces in Iran (Yazd Province). Affected trees exhibited a variable range of symptoms: dwarfing, shoot proliferation, internode shortening, small leaves, leaf rolling, abortive buds, appearance of very small shoots, hypertrophied, and die- back. The possibility of association of a phytoplasma with the disease was evaluated using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Total DNA was extracted from midribs of symptomatic and healthy olive plants using phytoplasma enriched procedure and tested for the presence of phytoplasma by nested-PCR using phytoplasmal- universal primers R16F2/R16R2, followed by primers fU5/rU3 which amplify 1200 and 880bp DNA fragments of 16SrDNA, respectively. PCR resulted in amplification of expected DNA fragments in symptomatic but not in healthy olive by both primer pairs. On the basis of symptoms and positive reaction in PCR, these plants can be infected with a phytoplasma. This is the first report of olive trees phytoplasmal disease in Iran. Identification of the agent and its comparison with other phytoplasmal isolates reported from other plants (hosts) in Iran are being studied. Based on the quarantine requirements, one of these trees was eradicated and two of them were transplanted in an isolated green house for further studies.
2398599333	With the development of technology and space exploration, studies on long-duration space flights have shown that microgravity induces damage to multiple organs, including the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). However, very little is known about the effects of long-term microgravity on DRG neurons. This study investigated the effects of microgravity on lumbar 5 (L5) DRG neurons in rats using the hindlimb unweighting (HU) model. Male (M) and female (F) Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into M- and F-control (CON) groups and M- and F-HU groups, respectively (n = 10). At the end of HU treatment for 4 weeks, morphological changes were detected. Myelin basic protein (MBP) and degenerated myelin basic protein (dgen-MBP) expressions were analyzed by immunofluorescence and western blot assays. Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) protein and mRNA expressions were also analyzed by immunohistochemistry, western blot, and RT-PCR analysis, respectively. Compared with the corresponding CON groups, the HU groups exhibited slightly loose junctions between DRG neurons, some separated ganglion cells and satellite cells, and lightly stained Nissl bodies that were of smaller size and had a scattered distribution. High levels of dgen-MBP and low MBP expressions were appeared and GDNF expressions were significantly decreased in both HU groups. Changes were more pronounced in the F-HU group than in the M-HU group. In conclusion, HU treatment induced damage of L5 DRG neurons, which was correlated with decreased total MBP protein expression, increased dgen-MBP expression, and reduced GDNF protein and mRNA expression. Importantly, these changes were more severe in F-HU rats compared with M-HU rats.
2398599410	AIM To establish a SYBR Green I quantitative real-time PCR method for detecting the expression of the TLR4 mRNA of mice and to monitor the dynamics for TLR4 mRNA level of mice bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (DC) in the process of the maturation and the effect of dexamethasone (DEX) on TLR4 expression. METHODS (1) DC from mice bone marrow were induced by cytokines and separated by magnetic beads. (2) The combined plasmid pUCm-T/TLR4 and pUCm-T/beta-actin for the standard materials in the real-time PCR was reconstructed. (3) The dynamics for the express TLR4 mRNA of DC cultivated in vitro for 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 days was detected respectively. (4) The TLR4 mRNA expression between DC treated with or without DEX was detected and compared. RESULTS (1) The DC with the purity over 90% were fully separated in success. (2) A SYBR Green I quantitative real-time PCR method for analyzing the TLR4 mRNA expression level of the mice was successful established. (3) TLR4 mRNA level was stable early during the culture of DC and then rise obviously at last. CONCLUSION There exists a close relationship between the level of TLR4 mRNA and the period of maturation of DC and the expression of TLR4 could be increased by DEX.
2398599607	We sequenced a 522 bp fragment including the tRNA Thr , tRNA Pro gene and the first half of the control region from 29 wild and cultured olive flounder specimens from Korea. Out of 522 nucleotide sites, 49 (9.4%) were variable, 23 haplotypes being found. Most haplotypes are unique in the wild population and only four were shared by cultured specimins. The nucleotide diversity and differences between wild and cultured populations were 0.025±0.013 and 0.015±0.008, and 12.94±6.00 and 7.83±3.75, respectively. Haplotype diversity was 0.98±0.02 and 0.49±0.09 in the wild and cultured populations, respectively. These results show that marked reductions of genetic variability in the hatchery strains were observed in the number of mitochondrial DNA haplotypes and haplotype diversity when compared to the wild populations. Furthermore, we detected significant population differentiation between both populations. The mtDNA sequencing technique used to evaluate the genetic variability of hatchery strains compared to that of the wild population is potential for genetic monitoring of olive flounder hatchery stocks.
2398599636	Piglet plasma insulin (I), cortisol (C), triiodothyronine (T3) and tetraiodothyronine (T4) levels have been studied for their dynamics depending on the age and metabolic energy in ration of pregnant sows. The considerable changes occur in the concentration of adaptive hormones in the piglet blood during 24 hours after birth. The level of insulin in the piglet blood during the first day increases from 1.1 +/- 0.18 to 27.4 +/- 5.9 mkU/ml, whereas C, T3, T4 levels sharply decrease. There are no considerable differences in hormone concentration in the blood of older (5- and 21-day) piglets. It is established that insulin concentration in the blood of piglets increases 11, 7 and 2 times by the 0, 6, 12th hours, respectively, after feeding pregnant sows with the ration containing nutrient animal fat. The 3- and 2-fold increase of T3 and T4 levels, respectively, was observed in the blood of newborn piglets from sows which received high fat ration. The influence of metabolic energy in the ration of pregnant sows at the level of T3 and T4 in the piglet blood also takes place at the later stages of neonatal development. It is supposed that piglets, whose mothers received extracaloric rations are more viable because of the changes in hormonal status in the neonatal period.
2240734043	Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is one of the most prevalent neoplasms worldwide. While numerous potent dietary insults were considered as oncogenic players for HNSCC development, the impact of metabolic imbalance was less emphasized during HNSCC carcinogenesis. Previous preclinical and epidemiological investigations showed that DM could possibly be correlated with greater incidence and poorer prognosis in HNSCC patients; however, the outcomes from different groups are contradictive and underlying mechanisms remains elusive. In the present study, the changes of cellular malignancy in response to prolonged glucose incubation in HNSCC cells were examined. The results demonstrated that hyperglycemia enhanced HNSCC cell malignancy over time through suppression of cell differentiation, promotion of cell motility, increased resistance to cisplatin, and up-regulation of the nutrient-sensing Akt/AMPK-mTORC1 pathway. Further analysis showed that a more aggressive tongue neoplastic progression was found under DM conditions compared to non-DM state whereas DM pathology led to a higher percentage of cervical lymph node metastasis and poorer prognosis in HNSCC patients. Taken together, the present study confirms that hyperglycemia and DM could enhance HNSCC malignancy and the outcomes are of great benefit in providing better anti-cancer treatment strategy for DM patients with HNSCC.
2240734488	The distributions of planktonic and periphytic algae were studied from April 2003 to February 2004 at Gwangju Stream. A total of 274 species, belongs to 8 classes, 19 orders, 6 suborders, 35 families, 4 subfamilies, 79 genera, was identified as algal flor
2240734652	Abstract Many of the blood-borne xenobiotics which result in injury to the lung are not inherently pneumotoxic but cause damage within the target cells following metabolic activation. This injury is usually restricted to those cells capable of bioactivation and thus, in addition to its clinical significance, it provides a valuable indicator of the normal metabolic activity within the numerous cell types present in lung. Not surprisingly, injury does not simply reflect the presence or absence of a particular enzyme but rather the balance between mechanisms for activation and deactivation. A change in the balance between different enzymes may also determine whether activation results in injury or tumorigenesis (Foster et al. 1992). Changes in particular types of cells cannot be determined by analysing whole lung homogenates. Isolation of particular cell types can provide valuable information but this approach does not address the differences between adjacent cells of the same type (Forkert & Moussa 1989; Dinsdale et al. 1992). Further progress may require the correlation of the injury with the status of individual cells; the quantitation of histochemical and immunocytochemical data is notoriously labour intensive but this approach may well be inescapable.
2398599804	The distortion of morphopoiesis or tail attachment to the capsid is a characteristic feature of morphogenetical development not only of a reproductive infection but also of the lysogenic induction of the defective bacteriophage Erwinia carotovora subsp. carotovora (Ecc). A model system for studying morphogenetical development and assembling of the virion was created on the basis of the phage ZF40 and its two virulent mutants ZF40-421 and ZF40(5/5), as well as the indicator culture Ecc M2-4/50 R1 being nontraditional host for these phages. It has helped to establish that the diameter of the phage capsid is not a conservative value. The presence of capsids of two types with the average diameters 60.3 and 65.0 nm is characteristic of the virmutant ZF40c(5/5)/50RI, while in the course of morphogenesis the phage ZF40-421/50RI forms only one type of heads of 65 nm in size. These heads are probably not firmly connected to the tails since the degree of the secondary destruction of the virions of the phage Zf40-421/50RI is considerably higher, than that of the virions of the phage ZF40c(5/5)/50RI. The number of capsids being 60.3 nm in diameter prevails considerably in the latter. The both virulent mutants as a whole are essentially more stable than their isogenic partners obtained on Ecc RC5297 which helps to make a conclusion about considerable influence of specific bacterial proteins of the host-cell on morphogenesis and morphopoiesis.
2398599811	Breeding to increase crop resistance is a common strategy to decrease damage caused by insect pests, especially in the current context where insecticides are becoming at the same time less accepted by society and less efficient because of widespread pest resistance. The main bottleneck of this strategy is phenotyping. Although simple, high-throughput methods have been proposed which could be highly useful, they may raise conceptual issues. Using field and laboratory experiments on oilseed rape (Brassica napus) and the pollen beetle (Brassicogethes aeneus syn. Meligethes aeneus), we illustrated possible difficulties with this approach: (i) field screenings might not represent the real attractiveness of the tested genotypes; (ii) plant phenology or spatial organization of the genotypes might bias field screening results; (iii) experiments based on detached plant parts (here, single flower buds or anthers) might not allow to infer the plant-insect relationship of the whole plant. We propose ways to better take these risks into account.
2398600339	Results of clinico-morphological and immunohistochemical studies of 44 cases of carcinosarcoma of the uterus are presented in an attempt to provide pathogenetic rationale for prognosticators of the disease. Immunohistochemical reactions were used to evaluate the expression of genes and mediators p53 and PTEN and cyclooxigenase (COX-2) in cells of mesenchyme and epithelium of tumor to gauge the influence of either component on its biological behavior. All patients were divided into two groups depending on whether they revealed expression of p53, PTEN and cyclooxigenase or not. The end results--overall survival and complete remission duration--were compared in both groups. No dominance of either component of carcinosarcoma was established.
2398600399	beta 2-Adrenergic receptors, which are encoded on chromosome 5q32-34, belong to the group of G-protein-linked hormone receptors with seven transmembrane domains. Upon agonist binding, adenylate cyclase is activated. Although the function of human leukocyte beta-adrenergic receptors is unknown, these cells are often used as a model system to study tissue beta-adrenergic receptors. In intact mononuclear leukocytes or membrane preparations, 1000-3000 beta 2-adrenergic receptors are found, having an antagonist affinity constant (KD) in the range of 25 pM. beta-Adrenergic receptor numbers are different in leukocyte subsets, with receptor density higher in B than in T cells. CD56+ or CD57+ natural killer cells express more receptors than CD8+ or CD4+ cells. KD is higher in CD8+ than in CD4+ cells. Acute sympathetic activation by isoproterenol infusion or short-lasting exercise leads to an increased number of mononuclear beta-adrenergic receptors with a slightly reduced proportion of those with high agonist affinity. Acute sympathetic activation by adrenaline infusion, short-term exercise, or psychological stress also causes a selective increase in circulating CD56+ or CD57+ lymphocytes which are rich in beta-adrenergic receptors. The results of several studies suggest that adrenaline-induced changes in beta-adrenergic receptors and the redistribution of leukocyte subsets may be linked. beta-Adrenergic receptors may mediate immuno-modulatory effects by causing selective cell mobilization.
2398600423	Suidasia nesbitti specimens for laboratory cultures and for biological studies were isolated from infested fish meal. Rearing conditions: temperature +25 degrees C, relative humidity 85%, food - dried baker's yeast. One day old females and males were paired and placed into separate rearing cages and observations of longevity and oviposition of mites were conducted. Fresh laid eggs were observed and mite development cycle was examined. Mean longevity of male (preimaginal + imaginal periods) amount 84.4 days, female in average 67.0 days. Average egg production of female per its whole life was 172.9. Life history took in average 14.4 days and natural mortality of various instars was 25%. Frequency of females was slightly higher than frequency of males.
2240736103	During the past twenty years it has become increasingly clear that biological membranes, like other cellular constituents, are under genetic control. Each membrane protein, and each enzyme required for the synthesis of membrane lipids, is now presumed to be coded for by a structural gene, whose nucleotide sequence determines the corresponding amino acid sequence of the protein. In addition, at least in some instances, regulatory genes exist which control the timing and rate of expression of the structural genes. As a result, the investigator interested in membrane transport mechanisms has access to a powerful analytical method. Genetic mutation can cause the specific loss — or even the specific alteration, one amino acid at a time — of a transport system, giving the investigator a chance to study the physiological consequences of the change.
2240736247	The KCL029 human embryonic stem cell line was derived from an embryo donated for research that carried a c.814 T > C mutation in the WAS gene, which is linked to the Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, a rare, inherited, X-linked, recessive disease characterized by immune dysregulation and microthrombocytopenia. The line is also carrier for a mutation p.N1152H in the gene encoding the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator CFTR. The ICM was isolated using laser microsurgery and plated on γ-irradiated human foreskin fibroblasts. Both the derivation and cell line propagation were performed in an animal product-free environment. Pluripotent state and differentiation potential were confirmed by in vitro assays.
2240736355	A new and distinct cultivar of Chrysanthemum plant named ‘Dekfullham’, characterized by its daisy-type inflorescences with spatulate to oblong-shaped, red purple-colored ray florets and yellow green-colored disc florets; strong and upright flowering stems; freely flowering habit; early and uniform flowering response; and good postproduction longevity.
2240736410	Mosquitofi sh (Gambusia) are sexually dimorphic; adult males have an elongation of the anal fi n to form a copulatory structure known as a gonopodium. Several studies since the early 1980s have reported elongated anal fi ns in female mosquitofi sh exposed to pulp and paper mill discharge, a phenomenon known as masculinization. Although adverse impacts have been suggested in these previous reports, the infl uence of masculinization on reproductive success has not been assessed for pulp mill effl uent-exposed eastern mosquitofi sh (Gambusia holbrooki or affi nis). The current study compared fecundity (number of fry per female at parturition) to an index of masculinization (ratio of anal fi n rays 4 to 6). Pregnant females were collected from two effl uent-receiving streams in Florida: Rice Creek and the Fenholloway River, over two reproductive seasons (2003 and 2004). Masculinization was consistent between years, with clear effects at the Fenholloway River site, while the response was minimal or nondetectable at the Rice Creek site. Masculinization was not correlated with the production of fry/fecundity at either site. Data suggest differing reproductive seasonal strategies between basins and populations but do not demonstrate any effects of pulp and paper exposure on reproductive success in mosquitofi sh.
2240736588	The application of biocontrol technique would be of special important in food industry as a result of the occurrence of fungal recontaminations during storage and after initial processing. Therfore the effect of some bioagents and Topsin fungicide ion the growth of four pathogenic fungi, Aspergillus flavus, A. parasiticus, A. ochraceus and Fusarium monilifor. The two types of yest completely protect peanut seeds to be invaded with A. parasiticus and F. moniliforme for 15 days of storage and the percentage of seed infection was so low till the 45th days of storage by all tested fungi. Results indicated that all treatment reduced the linear growth of all tested fungi. The two strain of yeast appear to be more effective against aflatoxin production by A. flavus> The use of yeast as commercial bioagents could be a safe approach for biocontrol against mould spoilage and mycotoxin formation in food and feed to replace the chemical fungicides may exhibit potential hazardous to man and environment.
2398600586	Bean weevil and maize weevil can cause considerable damage to stored grains. These insects are mainly controlled with synthetic chemical insecticides, which may bring serious problems to human and environmental health. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the efficiency of the essential oil of clove [Syzygium aromaticum (L.) Merrill & Perry (Myrtaceae) (origin: Bahia, season Sep.2014-Feb.2015)] in the control of S. zeamais and A. obtectus under laboratory conditions. The essential oil was extracted through the classic hydrodistillation process and its chemical components were identified via gas chromatography. Oil efficiency was tested at the doses of 35, 17.9, 8.9, 3.6, 1.8, 0.4 and 0.2 μL g-1 (derived from a pilot study) for insect control and the LC50 was determined. The results showed that eugenol was the major compound. The essential oil caused mortality of 100% for both species 48 h after treatment with the concentrations of 17.9 and 35 μL g-1. The LC50 for A. obtectus was 9.45 μL g-1, against 10.15 μL g-1 for S. zeamais. The use of clove essential oil represents a promising alternative to be used under storage conditions for the integrated management of stored grains pests.

2398601173	OBJECTIVE To explore the immunostimulatory effect of immunostimulant CH2a bearing thiazolidin-4-one on human invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cell function in vitro. METHODS Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained from healthy adults, and then amplified with α-Galcer and IL-2 in vitro. The iNKT cells were isolated from these proliferating cells by magnetic-activated cell sorting (MACS) method. The purified iNKT cells were labled with 5-(and 6)-carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFDA-SE) and then incubated with CH2a for functional analysis, including cell proliferation, expressions of IFN-γ and IL-4 by flow cytometry, proliferation rate and cytotoxicity by MTT assay. In additon, ELISA was performed to determine the levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 in cell culture media. RESULTS CH2a significantly promoted the proliferation of iNKT cells induced by IL-2 in vitro, stimulated the release of both IFN-r and IL-4, and led to the increase in IFN-γ/IL-4 ratio. More importantly, the cytotoxicity of iNKT was also markedly elevated under the stimulation of CH2a. CONCLUSION Immunostimulant CH2a probably promote the production of Th1-like cytokines and the differentiation of Th0 to Th1, so as to improve cellular immune function. In addition, CH2a could significantly enhance the cytotoxicity of iNKT cells.

2240736869	Using the whole cotyledonary node as explants, a rapid and efficient regeneration protocol was established for kenaf ( Hibiscus cannabinus L.) on Murashige and Skoog (MS) basal medium. The effects of the plant growth regulators: N6-benzyladenine (BA), indole-3-aceticacid (IAA) and the non-ironic surfactant pluronic F-68 (F-68) on shoot regeneration were evaluated by the orthogonal design L16 (4 5 ). The best combination for shoot regeneration was MS medium supplemented with 5.0 mg l -1 BA, 0.3 mg l - 1 IAA and 0.2% (m/v) F-68. The maximum number of shoots per explant and the frequency of shoot regeneration were 12.97 and 100%, respectively, after cultivation for 21 days. The results indicated that BA had the greatest contribution on shoot inducing, followed by F-68, and IAA showed no significant effect on shoot formation. Furthermore, 0.5 ~ 2.0 mgl -1 of IAA and 1-naphthyleneacetic acid (NAA) were used respectively for root induction. More than 13 roots were obtained on MS medium supplemented with 2.0 mgl -1 of IAA after culturing for 14 days. IAA was more effective than NAA on root induction. According to this method, the plantlets could be obtained within 2 months and showed no morphological difference from those naturally grown plants. This protocol could be used for kenaf genetic improvement by Agrobacterium mediated transformation. Keywords: Kenaf, Hibiscus cannabinus L., cotyledonary node, shoot regeneration, rooting
2240737516	Hominis Placenta has a broad array of clinical applications in Korean medicine, including treatment of inflammatory conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis. The purpose of this study is to explore the global gene expression profiles in human RAW 264.7 cell lines treated with Hominis Placenta herbal-acupuncture solution (HPHAS) using microarray analysis. The RAW 264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS), HPHAS, or both. Of the 8,170 genes profiled in this study, with a cut-off level of two-fold change in the expression, 72 genes (CTD1, regulating synaptic membrane exocytosis 2, etc.) were upregulated and 135 genes (splicing factor, arginine/serine-rich 1, actinin, alpha 1, etc.) downregulated following LPS treatment. One gene (acrosin) was upregulated and 12 genes (phospholipase A2, group IB, neurofilament, heavy polypeptide 200kDa, etc.) were downregulated following HPHAS treatment. Eleven genes (RAB27A, member RAS oncogene family, eosinophil peroxidase, etc.) were upregulated and 16 genes (V-maf musculoaponeurotic fibrosarcoma oncogene homolog G (avian), RW1 protein, etc.) were downregulated following co-stimulation of HPHAS and LPS. It is thought that microarrays will play an ever-growing role in the advance of our understanding of the pharmacological actions of HPHAS in the treatment of arthritis. Further studies, however, are required to concretely prove the effectiveness of HPHAS.
2240737644	Both translation arrest and proteasome stress associated with accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated protein aggregates were considered as a cause of delayed neuronal death after transient global brain ischemia; however, exact mechanisms as well as possible relationships are not fully understood. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of chemical ischemia and proteasome stress on cellular stress responses and viability of neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y and glioblastoma T98G cells. Chemical ischemia was induced by transient treatment of the cells with sodium azide in combination with 2-deoxyglucose. Proteasome stress was induced by treatment of the cells with bortezomib. Treatment of SH-SY5Y cells with sodium azide/2-deoxyglucose for 15 min was associated with cell death observed 24 h after treatment, while glioblastoma T98G cells were resistant to the same treatment. Treatment of both SH-SY5Y and T98G cells with bortezomib was associated with cell death, accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins, and increased expression of Hsp70. These typical cellular responses to proteasome stress, observed also after transient global brain ischemia, were not observed after chemical ischemia. Finally, chemical ischemia, but not proteasome stress, was in SH-SY5Y cells associated with increased phosphorylation of eIF2α, another typical cellular response triggered after transient global brain ischemia. Our results showed that short chemical ischemia of SH-SY5Y cells is not sufficient to induce both proteasome stress associated with accumulation of ubiquitin-conjugated proteins and stress response at the level of heat shock proteins despite induction of cell death and eIF2α phosphorylation.
2240737701	Day-old broiler chicks (150) were randomly distributed into 15 groups of 10 each. Five dietary treatments having maize (100%)-M, maize (33%) + sorghum (33%) + finger millet (33%)-MSF, maize (33%) + sorghum (33%) + pearl millet (33%)-MSP, maize (33%) + pearl millet (33%) + finger millet (33%)-MPF and maize (25%) + sorghum (25%) + pearl millet (25%) + finger millet (25%)-MSPF at fixed calori:protein ratio for 0–4 weeks starter and 4–7 weeks finisher phase were prepared. Each experimental diet was offered ad lib as mash to three groups of chicks from 0–7 weeks of age. During 0–7 weeks of age, the diets having a combination of sorghum and pearl millet (MSP) or sorghum, finger millet and pearl millet (MSPF) with maize resulted in similar body weight gain, feed intake and FCR, while the combinations of finger millet with sorghum (MSF) or pearl millet (MPF) caused lower (P<0.05) gain in body weight than the maize based control diet (M). Feed intake remained statistically similar among all the dietaiy treatments during this period. However, FCR was poorer (P<0.05) in diet MSF than the other diets. Gross energy and DM metabolizability and nitrogen retention did not differ among dietaiy treatments. The eviscerated yields also did not differ due to dietary treatments. The feed cost of production/kg gain or meat (Rs) was lower in diets MSP, MPF and MSPF than maize based control diet M. It was inferred that a combination of maize, pearl millet and sorghum @ 33% each or maize, pearl millet, sorghum and finger millet @ 25% each in diet of broilers could support the optimum growth and feed conversion efficiency without affecting nutrient utilization and meat yield.
2398601327	Following our discovery that constitutional mutations in EED can cause overgrowth, we screened our cohort of patients with Weaver-like features for mutations in this gene. Here we describe a second patient with a different, rare and de novo mutation in EED. Phenotypic overlap with our first case of EED-associated overgrowth is significant. Now that we have found two unrelated families of different ethnicities, with a similar rare phenotype, both associated with de novo mutations in this member of the PRC2 complex, we are confident that EED is indeed a novel overgrowth gene.
2398601620	A B S T R A C T The leaves of Aegle marmelos were found infected with black mildew during a routine mycological survey at district Bilaspur, a south west region of Himachal Pradesh. Fungal colonies form infected leaves were analysed for morphological and microscopic studies. Nail polish technique was used to study the colonies in situ. Presence of unicellular appressoria with sarciniform and Questieriella conidial anamorphic states identified it as the fungus belongs to genus Schiffnerula. Further investigation identified it as Schiffnerula girijae Hosag. & Archana. The fungus is reported previously form Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India on the same host (A. marmelos) but no reports from other parts of the country. Therefore, this is the second report of black mildew on Aegle marmelos form India while first from north India.
2398601654	Methods are disclosed for enhancing protein production. One method comprises preparing a vector by inserting a gene encoding ubiquitin in front of a gene encoding a protein of interest and inserting the vector into a cell. A fusion protein will be expressed which includes ubiquitin plus the protein of interest. Ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases can cleave the fusion protein leaving the desired protein in its free state. This method causes enhanced production of the protein of interest as compared to performing the same method without the ubiquitin gene as part of the vector. A ubiquitin promoter is unnecessary to yield this enhanced production and is not used. A second method is very similar except that in place of a ubiquitin gene, a gene encoding fourteen amino acids of cucumber mosaic virus coat protein is inserted in front of the gene of interest. This results in expression of a fusion protein comprising the fourteen amino acid residues of the coat protein bonded to the protein of interest. The fusion protein is produced at a higher level than is the protein when the coat protein gene fragment is not present in the vector. In both methods the genes can be placed under the control of heterologous promoters such as a 35S promoter.
2398601663	A plastic-adherent mononuclear cell population in human bone marrow produces non-plastic-adherent nucleated cells in liquid cultures. These cells can be harvested from the culture medium and a proportion of them can be identified as granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (GM-CFC) by plating them in semi-solid cultures with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The generation of GM-CFC from their plastic-adherent precursors can be amplified considerably by adding 5637 conditioned medium (CM) to the liquid phase of the adherent cell cultures. This effect of 5637 CM cannot be reproduced by recombinant (r) GM-CSF or interleukins (ILs) 1, 3 or 6 if they are added singly to the culture medium. In contrast, the combination of GM-CSF + IL-1 equalled or surpassed the activity of 5637 CM. The combinations of rGM-CSF + rIL-3 and rGM-CSF + IL-6 also mimicked the activity of 5637 CM but less effectively than GM-CSF + IL-1.
2398602138	Transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) is secreted by cells in high molecular weight, latent forms and the in vivo mechanisms for the activation remain largely an enigma. Women who have palpable breast cyst with intracystic Na/K 3. Finding of significantly higher concentrations of TGF-beta 2 in the Na/K > 3 group than Na/K 3 group. The aim of the present study was to characterise the latent forms of TGF-beta 2 in breast cyst fluid using HPLC, affinity chromatography, SDS-PAGE and immunostaining techniques. We found that TGF-beta 2 is present in high molecular weight, latent forms in breast cyst fluid: as a complex, probably with alpha 2-macroglobulin and a 56 kD protein which is likely to be a precursor form of TGF-beta 2.
2398602194	Dendritic cells (DCs), which can shape their functions depending on the microenvironment, are crucial for the delicate balance of immunity and tolerance during pregnancy. However, the mechanism underlying the microenvironment-educated plasticity of DC differentiation during pregnancy remains largely unclear. Here, we found that the differentiation of conventional DCs (cDCs) and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs) is regulated in a tissue-specific manner during pregnancy. The ratio of cDCs and pDCs remained constant in the spleen. However, the ratio changed in the para-aortic lymph nodes (LNs), where cDC percentages were significantly reduced concurrent with an increase in pDCs from E8.5 to E16.5. Moreover, the expansion of pDCs and T regulatory (Treg) cells was correlated in the para-aortic LNs, and pDCs had more potential to induce regulatory T cells (Tregs) compared with cDCs (independent of IDO expression). Notably, the balance between cDCs and pDCs is disrupted in IFN-γ-induced abnormal pregnancy, accompanied by lower Treg percentages in the para-aortic LNs and decidua. To further identify the underlying mechanism, we found that elevated IFN-γ can increase the levels of GM-CSF to alter the differentiation of pDCs into cDCs in vivo. Therefore, we provide a novel regulatory mechanism underlying pregnancy-related immune tolerance that involves the balance of DC subsets, which may offer a new target for the prevention of human spontaneous abortion.
2398602314	As one of the most elaborate and diverse sexual signals, bird songs are prominent among mate choice criteria. Females generally prefer mates with larger repertoire size, which promotes the evolution of song complexity. However, there are also some songbirds that have far simpler and less diverse vocalizations, which have not been the focus of scientific scrutiny. Most Phylloscopus warblers are accomplished singers with complex songs. In contrast, Hume’s Warbler (P. humei) has extremely simple songs. In order to explore the song’s function, its evolutionary significance and particularly to assess its possible relationship with parental investment, we studied mate choice of the subspecies P. h. mandellii in Lianhuashan National Nature Reserve, Gansu, China. We recorded body measurements and songs of breeding males and then explored their relationships with the date of clutch initiation, reasoning that the characteristics of males that are involved with early nesting activities reflect female mate preferences. We also recorded egg size and body measurements of nestlings to assess the relationship between parental investment and mate choice. We found that male wing and tail lengths were positively correlated with early clutch initiation as were songs characterized by short duration and rapid rise to maximum amplitude. We also found that early-breeding females did not lay large eggs, but produced more surviving young, which grew up faster. Female mate choice criteria in this bird include both visual signals and song characteristics. Our study supports the hypothesis that females may judge male quality from quite subtle differences. In order to reduce the risk of predation, a preference for such inconspicuous male characteristics may be partially driven by high vulnerability of this warbler to predators as a ground-nesting species.

2398602514	Hemorrhagic mucosal lesions are produced during intestinal ischemia and after reperfusion due at least in part to the accumulation and activation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes in the tissue. It has been shown in vitro that adenosine is instrumental in attenuating this pathophysiological process. Acadesine [5-amino-4-imidazolecarboxamide (AICA) riboside], a purine nucleoside analogue, increases the availability of adenosine in the tissue. The aim of the study was therefore to assess the influence of acadesine treatment on neutrophil accumulation, purine metabolism, and mucosal damage after intestinal ischemia and reperfusion. Intestinal ischemia was induced in cats by partial occlusion of the superior mesenteric artery for 2 h. Samples of the small intestine were exercised before and at the end of the hypotensive period as well as 10 and 60 min after reperfusion. Conjugated dienes, myeloperoxidase, and reduced and oxidized glutathione, as well as the purine metabolites, were determined in the tissue samples. The tissue was also examined histologically. Six cats received saline, and six cats were treated initially before ischemia with acadesine (2.5 mg/kg body wt i.v.) over 5 min as a bolus. Thereafter, acadesine (0.5 mg.kg-1.min- i.v.) was given continuously during ischemia and 30 min after reperfusion. Acadesine treatment significantly attenuated the mucosal lesions seen during reperfusion. This improvement was due at least in part to the inhibition of neutrophil accumulation, as judged by low myeloperoxidase levels. The prevention of neutrophil activation resulted most likely from increased adenosine concentrations in the intestinal tissue in the early reperfusion period.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2398602544	The aim of this study was to evaluate forage quality and absorption of heavy metals in grasses of grazing lands in mine revegetation area. Grazing land was dominated by Brachiaria decumbens (BD), which occupied about 87% in the pasture’ syielding ability of 14.8 Mg DM/ha/year, followed by Centrocema pubescens (CP), Calopogonium mucunoides (CM) and Imperata cylindrica (IC) at 6, 4 and 3%, respectively. Both of in vitro dry matter digestibility and organic matter digestibility were the highest in BD and CM, followed by CP and the lowest in IC. Structural carbohydrates of cellulose and hemicelluloses were the highest in BD, contrary to Acid Detergent Lignin (ADL) concentration, which was the highest in IC and the lowest in BD, while CP and CM showed the middle in ADL and cellulose concentrations among the four forage species. Heavy metals of nickel (Ni), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb) were detected in the order of Ni > Cr > Pb in the grasses examined and harvested on mine-revegetation area in Sorowako, Indonesia.
2240738097	Proc Amer Assoc Cancer Res, Volume 45, 20044303 Glucocorticoid hormones have a variety of important functions in eucaryotic cells and tissues; they usually promote cell differentiation and inhibit proliferation. It is known that glucocorticoids have an inhibitory effect on androgen-independent prostate carcinoma (PC) cell growth in vitro and in vivo. The glucocorticoid control of cellular functions is mediated via glucocorticoid receptor (GR), a well-known transcription factor. In this work we characterized the effect of GR on prostate development and prostate cell proliferation in transgenic mice overexpressing GR in basal epithelial cells of prostate. To quantitatively characterize the mouse prostate morphology we performed the analysis of the luminal bridging that reflects the complexity of prostate gland. We found that in both lobes of prostate of adult K5.GR transgenic males the luminal bridging was significantly decreased. In dorsolateral prostate of K5.GR mice the number of glands with luminal bridging was three times lower than in prostate of w.t. littermates. In ventral mouse prostate the luminal bridging is more common finding. Thus, we have compared the average number of luminal bridging /gland, and found that the luminal bridging was more than 2.5 times decreased in K5.GR transgenics in comparison with w.t. littermates. In addition, we have evaluated the proliferation rate in prostate glands using BrdU immunostaining. We found the statistically significant two-fold decrease of the number of BrdU-positive cells in both lobes of prostate glands in K5.GR-transgenic mice. These data indicate that GR plays an important role in regulation of prostate development and proliferation.
2240738471	Factors effecting foraging behaviors of Trigona collina in a mixed deciduous forest at Phitsanulok Nature Education Center and Phuhinrongkla National Park were investigated in twelve colonies during November 2003 and April 2004. The results showed that physical factors (temperature, relative humidity and light intensity) effect the beginning time for foraging. Stingless bees began to forage when the temperature was 18 ๐C with 0-0.001 K.Lux of light intensity and 95% relative humidity. Foragers’ activity was relatively high in a range of temperature from 30 ๐C to 32 ๐C and at 75% relative humidity. Number of foraging bees had the positive correlation with light intensity in the range of 2-6 K.Lux and gradually decreased with the increasing of light intensity. The foraging behavior was consistent during the sunrise period with the highest pollen loads between 9.30 a.m. and 11.30 a.m. Keywords: foraging behaviors, stingless bees, Trigona collina and physical/abiotic factors
2240738499	To study the metabolic fate of L-histidine and histamine in rat isolated enterocytes, enterocytes were incubated in the presence of 0.1 mM L-[U-14C] histidine. At the rate of 11.1 +/- 2.7 pmol/10(6) cells/30 min, the amino acid was incorporated into cellular proteins. 80 microM cycloheximide, i.e. a protein synthesis inhibitor, inhibited this incorporation by 70 +/- 17%. L-histidine was used for cellular protein synthesis which depended on time and concentration. 0.1 mM L-[U-14C] histidine was little oxidized by intestinal cells, i.e. 0.12 +/- 0.06 pmol/10(6) cells/30 min, and was not converted into histamine. When 10 mM histamine was added to the incubation medium, it completely inhibited the incorporation of 0.1 mM [1,4-14C] putrescine into isolated enterocytes. In enterocyte homogenates, this corresponded to inhibition by histamine of putrescine incorporation as catalyzed by transglutaminase activity. Since histamine incorporation into TCA-precipitable material derived from enterocyte homogenates depended on time and concentration, we concluded that exogenous, but not de novo-formed histamine was able to compete with putrescine incorporation into enterocytes as catalyzed by transglutaminase activity.
2240738549	The purpose of these studies was to examine an early carcinogen-induced change in primary human epithelial cell cultures and to attempt to reverse this change with retinoic acid. Pnmary cultures of human foreskin keratinocytes were prepared and exposed to the carcinogen, propane sultone. After each passage, a portion of cells were plated into medium containing increasing amounts of calcium. In a series of experiments it became evident that carcinogen exposed cells continued to grow in the presence of added calcium. Solvent control cell growth was decreased under such conditions. This new phenotype became apparent after the third subculture, but was pronounced after the fourth subculture. The addition of retinoic acid to the culture medium at each medium change reduced this effect and the keratinocytes grew more slowly, similar to control cells, in the presence of added calcium. The results suggest that carcinogen-exposed human keratinocytes acquire a resistance to calcium-induced differentiation or growth cessation and that retinoic acid can ameliorate this process. Although the mechanism of retinoic acid's inhibition remains unclear, these studies do provide a human cell model system which can be used to screen potential chemopreventive agents and for further mechanistic research.

2240738867	In arid and semi-arid rangelands, grazing as one of the natural or human induced processes has direct and indirect effects on structure and dynamics of plant community and ecosystems. A study was done to analyze the effects of grazing on plant species diversity and Plant Functional Types‘ (PFTs) diversity of arid and semi-arid rangelands. We analyzed plant richness and diversity data from 75 sampling plots located in five bioclimatic zones of Khabr National Park containing a total of 73 plant species. Ward's hierarchical clustering was then used to cluster all plant species into eight PFTs according to the chosen traits. For each site, grazing intensity was estimated in three classes (low grazing, medium and high grazing intensities). We found that as grazing intensity increased, total species richness and diversity were decreased. Considering PFTs as total showed the same pattern for species; however, each PFT diversity and richness didn‘t display a significant different response to grazing. Looking at each PFT relative cover change in different grazing intensities showed that PFT1 and PFT8 were grazing sensitivities while PFT6 and PFT7 benefited from grazing and their relative cover increased consistently in response to the increased grazing intensity. PFT3 and PFT4 had the highest relative cover rates in moderately grazed areas. PFT2 and PFT5 had a complicated response to grazing and their relative cover was the minimum at moderately grazed sits. This finding may imply that grazing has completely negative impacts on the community structure and it seems that it reduces plant species and functional types‘ diversity and richness. It can be also concluded that the analyses on PFTs level possibly give more insight into the grazing response of plant community in arid and semi-arid rangelands than those on species level but there is a need for further studies.
2398603910	Une serie d’enquetes sur les filarioses humaines menee systematiquement en 1967 et 1968 dans 147 villages de l’ouest de la Haute-Volta a permis de preciser la reparation de l’Onchocercose, de la filariose de Bancroft, de la filariose a D. perstans et du ver de Guinee, ainsi que l’incidence economique de ces diverses affections.Ces enquetes ont, d’autre part, permis l’etude, en ce qui concerne les deux premieres maladies, des modalites de propagation : il est en particulier remarquable que, bien que transmise a l’homme par un seul vecteur, l’Onchocercose se propage dans la region etudiee, selon plusieurs modalites differentes, ce qui implique des variations dans la biologie meme du vecteur commun.Un tableau des resultats releves, village par village, est annexe a la presente etude, ceci pour permettre une comparaison facile avec les observations pouvant etre faites par d’autres chercheurs, dans une region qui devrait etre mise en valeur dans les prochaines annees.
2398603947	OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the toxic effects of chromium (VI) on the placental function and reproduction in rats. For the study, the placental prolactin-growth hormone (PRL-GH) gene expression, placental trophoblast cell differentiation and reproductive data were analyzed.  METHODS: The pregnancies of F344 Fisher rats were checked by the presence of a copulatory plug or sperm in the vaginal smear, which was defined as day 0 of the pregnancy. Pregnant rats were divided into the three groups. The control group was given tap water (chromium level < 0.001 ppm) and the remaining groups were given 250 or 750 ppm of chromium (VI) [as potassium dichromate], from day 7 to 19 of the pregnancy. Rats were sacrificed at days 11 and 20 of pregnancy. The mRNA levels of PRL-GH and Pit-1a and b isotype genes were analyzed by Northern blot hybridization and reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The hormonal concentration was analyzed by radioimmunoassay, and the differentiation of placental trophoblast cells were observed by histochemical studies. Reproductive data, such as placental and fetal weights, pregnancy period, and litter size, were surveyed at day 20 of pregnancy and after birth. A statistical analysis was carried out using the SAS program (version 8.1).  RESULTS: The mRNA levels of the prolactin-growth hormone (PRL-GH) family of genes were dose dependently reduced by chromium exposure. The mRNA levels of Pit-1a and b isotype genes that induce the expression of the PRL-GH family of genes were also reduced by chromium exposure. The PRL-GH hormonal concentration in the rat placenta, fetus and maternal blood were decreased by chromium exposure. In the middle stage of pregnancy (day 11), a high dose of chromium suppressed the differentiation of spongiotrophoblast cells that secret the PRLGH hormones. In the last stage of pregnancy (day 20), a high dose of chromium induced apoptosis of placental cells. Reproductive data, such as placental and fetal weights, litter size, were reduced, but the pregnancy period was extended in the group exposed to chromium compared with the controls.  CONCLUSIONS: Chromium (VI) disrupts the ordered functions of the placenta, which leads to reproductive disorders in rats.
2398603969	Three hundred and seventy adult skulls (284 crania of unknown sex, 58 males and 28 females) from Gujarat State of India were examined for the incidence of non-metric variants and compared with other populations to establish the distance between them. In general the Gujarati incidences are of similar order to those in other series. The mean measures of divergence between Gujarati and other populations were all statistically significant (P less than 0.001). The Gujarati differed most from Australian Aborigines, but only slightly from the Burma, Punjab and Egypt samples. From the same material side and sex dimorphism was also tested to ascertain that how far sides and sexes can be pooled in Indian sample for making comparison between populations. In Gujarati population out of 22 cranial variants only four show sex difference and in case of bilateral traits, none of the variant has shown significant (P less than 0.05) side to side difference.

2240740576	A specimen of an ascomycetous fungus collected during a field trip was identified as Gymnoascus Baran. Soil samples collected from 0-20 cm depth were studied for isolation of fungi using a soil dilution plate method. Based on the morphological and molecular characters the specimens were identified as Gymnoascus reesii. Genomic DNA was extracted and a nuclear rDNA region, containing the internal transcribed spacers 1, 2 and 5.8S gene of rDNA (ITS) were amplified and PCR products were sequenced. Amplicon was purified, sequenced and submitted to the GenBank (Acc. No. JQ387570-71). The resulting sequence (600 bp) was submitted to a BLAST search to find most similar sequences in GenBank. The search results showed highest similarity of Iranian isolates to other isolates of G. reesii from GenBank. In the light of literature on ascomycetous fungi, Gymnoascus Baran is a new record for Iran mycoflora. The specimens are kept in fungal collection of the Department of Plant Protection, Razi University, Kermanshah, Iran.
2398604316	Baboons in a captive breeding colony were monitored twice a year, and new additions were screened on arrival for shedding of Herpesvirus papio 2 (HVP2) and serologic reactivity to the agent. For 128 individual animals tested over a period of 1.5 years, shedding of infective virus was detected in 13 of 342 swab specimens (3.8%), each of these incidents representing shedding by a different animal. Among long-term colony animals, infective virus was recovered on only two occasions (5 of 236 swab specimens from five individuals). In all but one instance, animals shedding virus were infants, not adults, and all animals were shedding virus in the oral cavity. One of these five instances was an isolated case, but four (three infants and one adult) were clustered within a single breeding group. Molecular analyses of the HVP2 isolates from this cluster indicated that they likely arose from a single common source, probably the mother of one of the infants. None of 31 wild-caught baboons added to the colony during this period were found to be shedding infective virus, despite 93.5% of them being seropositive for HVP2. In contrast, 6 of 18 adult baboons (all seropositive) transferred into the colony from another breeding colony were found to be shedding HVP2 either orally (3 of 6) or genitally (3 of 6). In addition, 2 of 8 juvenile baboons in this shipment were found to be shedding virus in the oropharynx. Overall, 10 of 13 instances of HVP2 isolation were from the oropharynx rather than the genital tract, and 6 of 13 baboons shedding virus were infants or juveniles rather than adults. These results suggest that, although venereal transmission of HVP2 occurs among adult animals, oral infection of young, sexually immature baboons is not uncommon.
2398604369	Background Acute idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a serious and progressive form of lung disease, and millions of people suffer from this disease in the world. To provide clues for getting a better understanding of the mechanism of this disease, we identified and further analyzed the differential expressed genes in IPF. Method In this study, we downloaded the gene expression microarray (GSE10667) from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. The dataset contained a total of 23 samples, including 15 normal controls and 8 diseases samples (IPF). Then, we identified the differentially expressed genes between normal and disease samples with packages in R language. Consequently, the PPI network was also constructed for the products of these DEGs, and modules in the network were analyzed by Cytoscape's plug-in Mcode and Bingo. Furthermore, enrichment analysis was performed by DAVID to illustrate the altered pathways in IPF. The drug compounds for PLK1 were screened in DrugBank. Results Atotal of 349 genes were identified as differentially expressed genes between normal and disease samples, and we constructed a protein-protein interaction network which included 200 pairs of proteins. Then three modules were identified in our network. Function of these modules were predicted to be related to protein kinase binding, extracellular matrix structural and structural constituent of cytoskeleton, respectively. Finally, we focused on module A including 18 DEGs. Conclusions PLK1 (Polo like kinge-1) in this module was predicted as a marker gene in IPF, which was related to cell cycle pathway. Several compounds were found which may be the potential drug for IPF.
2398604372	We studied the effects of six cycles of repeated cyclophosphamide (CTX) therapy followed by restorative therapy with either granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) or G-CSF on the hematopoietic stem cell compartment. Stem cell function was assessed by serially transferring bone marrow cells from CTX-CSF-treated mice into lethally irradiated recipient mice. Bone marrow cells from mice that initially received either G-CSF or GM-CSF after CTX therapy more rapidly lost the ability to repopulate the recipient lymphoid organs, showed a dramatic loss of hematopoietic progenitors, a more rapid loss of CFU-S capacity, and a 40% to 50% reduction in marrow repopulating ability (MRA). Interleukin-1 (IL-1) appeared to have little effect on the CTX-treated mice when used alone. However, when administered before the CTX-CSF regimen, IL-1 prevented the stem cell depletion as determined by CFU-C, CFU-S, and MRA through the serial transplantation procedures. These results support the hypothesis that repeated treatments with myelosuppressive drugs followed by stimulation with the CSFs may induce damage to the host stem cell compartment, and further suggest that pretreatment with IL-1 before CTX therapy may prevent this stem cell damage.
2398604404	Aim: To clarify the post-glacial biogeography of the Annamite and eastern Chinese ungulate faunas, and determine whether current understanding of Asian mammalian biogeography is biased by pseudo-extinctions and pseudo-endemism associated with a historical extinction filter. Location: Modern-day specimens of giant muntjac (Muntiacus vuquangensis) from the Annamite Mountains of Laos and Vietnam were compared with zooarchaeological specimens of extinct giant muntjac (M. gigas) from eastern China, and with a reference sample of northern red muntjac (M. vaginalis) from China, Southeast Asia and South Asia. Methods: We analysed a data set of antler measurements using Multivariate analyses of variance (MANOVAs), principal component analyses (PCAs) and scaling relationships, to quantify morphometric variation between extinct and living giant muntjacs in relation to variation shown by a different sympatric large-bodied muntjac species. We also attempted ancient biomolecule analysis of Holocene samples from China. Results: Although the combined giant muntjac sample can be differentiated from the reference red muntjac sample in all of our multivariate morphometric analyses, no significant differences are shown between extinct and living giant muntjacs using any analyses, matching the pattern seen when comparing conspecific red muntjac samples from across the same geographical region. Main conclusions: We find no support for recognizing extinct and living giant muntjacs as distinct taxa, and post-glacial populations from China and the Annamites should probably all be referred to M. gigas. The likely conspecificity of giant muntjacs across Eastern and Southeast Asia demonstrates that current-day Asian mammalian biogeography has been shaped by an extinction filter and challenges the idea that the Annamite region represents a cradle of evolution; instead, it may represent a refuge of diversity for some taxa, preserving remnant pseudo-endemic populations of species that have been extirpated across other parts of their former ranges.
2398604579	The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthetic pathway in Trypanosoma brucei bloodstream forms includes the formation of glycolipid C. This molecule is the inositol-acylated form of the GPI anchor precursor, glycolipid A. There is no evidence for the transfer of glycolipid C to protein in vivo and the role of glycolipid C is unclear. In this paper we show that glycolipid C is not synthesised in the presence of phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF) and that glycolipid C is not an obligatory intermediate on the pathway to the formation of glycolipid A. Using pulse-chase experiments we show that glycolipid A and glycolipid C are in a dynamic equilibrium and we suggest that only the forward reaction (glycolipid A conversion to glycolipid C) is inhibited by PMSF

2240741635	The morphological characters leading to antixenosis type of resistance, against Spodoptera litura (Fabr.) and capsule borer, Conogethes puncliferalis Guen were studied during 2000 and 2001. The castor genotypes with leaves of papaya type (RG-1766). flat (RG-2291), shallow cup (RG-2327) and small size leaves (RG-2679) were less preferred by Spodoptera than those with purple (RG-1930) and large size leaves (RG-11). The capsule borer infestation was low in the genotypes with loose (RG-1934) and very loose (RG-2543) spikes and with small sized (RG-2635) and non-spiny capsules (RG-258). The castor genotypes with double and triple bloom viz., RG-2551 and 2646 were less preferred by the leafhopper, Empoasca flavescens (Fabr.) and exhibited lower degree of hopper burn while the zero and single blooms were more preferred. Similar reaction of castor was found against thrips, while it was reverse in case of whitefly. The hybrid DCH-177, with single boom was susceptible to leafhopper.
2240741675	Parthenogenetic activation of oocytes is a helpful tool to obtain blastocysts, of which the inner cell mass may be used for derivation of embryonic stem cells. In order to improve activation and embryonic development after parthenogenesis, we tried to use sperm injection and subsequent removal of the sperm head to mimic the natural Ca2+ increases by release of the oocyte activating factor. Visualization of the sperm could be accomplished by Hoechst staining and ultraviolet (UV) light irradiation. To exclude negative effects of this treatment, we examined toxicity on activated mouse oocytes. After activation, oocytes were incubated in Hoechst 33342 or 33258 stain and exposed to UV irradiation. The effects on embryonic development were evaluated. Our results showed that both types of Hoechst combined with UV irradiation have toxic effects on parthenogenetically activated mouse oocytes. Although activation and cleavage rate were not affected, blastocyst formation was significantly reduced. Secondly, we used MitoTracker staining for removal of the sperm. Sperm heads were stained before injection and removed again after 1 h. However, staining was not visible anymore in all oocytes after intracytoplasmic sperm injection. In case the sperm could be removed, most oocytes died after 1 day. As MitoTracker was also not successful, alternative methods for sperm identification should be investigated.
2398604805	1. The metabolism of isolated fat cells from parametrial adipose tissue of starved normal rats was studied during 8hr. incubation. 2. There was a three- to eight-fold increase in conversion of glucose into carbon dioxide, fatty acids and glycerol during the fourth to eighth hours of incubation in 4% albumin buffer over that seen during the first 4hr. of incubation. 3. The addition of growth hormone and dexamethasone to fat cells at the start of the incubation period accelerated lipolysis during the first 4hr. of incubation but no further effect was seen during the fourth to eighth hours of incubation. Addition of growth hormone and dexamethasone to fat cells that had been incubated for 4hr. did not accelerate lipolysis during the next 4hr. whether fat cells were incubated with or without glucose. 4. Fat cells incubated for prolonged periods also displayed a reduced sensitivity to the lipolytic action of adrenocorticotrophic hormone. 5. During prolonged incubation there was no damage to the cells as judged by the retention of two soluble cytoplasmic enzymes, lactate dehydrogenase and malate dehydrogenase, within the cells.
2398604898	The PCR copy of the ribR gene of Bacillus subtilis was subcloned in Escherichia coli cells under the control of the phage T7 inducible promoter. The polypeptide of 26 kDa corresponding to the 690-bp gene is the product of the ribR gene. The protein encoded by the ribR gene is flavokinase, and the riboflavin-reduced form is the substrate for it.
2398604921	The ontogeny of the L-glutamate (GLU) and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neuronal systems in the guinea pig hippocampus was investigated with respect to tissue amino acid content, and spontaneous and K(+)-stimulated release of GLU and GABA. Transverse hippocampal slices were prepared from the guinea pig fetus at day 45 (brain growth spurt), 55 and 63 of gestation (term, about 68 days), from the 5-days-old neonate, and from the young adult. GLU and GABA release was determined as efflux from hippocampal slices into Krebs'-bicarbonate medium using a dynamic, submerged, superfusion apparatus. Hippocampal GLU content decreased during development, whereas GABA content was constant for all the ages investigated. The magnitude of spontaneous GLU efflux decreased during development; there was no measurable spontaneous GABA efflux. The K+ concentration-GLU efflux response curve was bell-shaped for the fetus at the three selected gestational ages, and was curvilinear for the neonate and adult. The apparent EC75 of K(+)-stimulated GLU efflux was higher for the neonate and adult compared with the fetus. In contrast, the K+ concentration-GABA efflux response curve was curvilinear, and the apparent EC75 of K+ was similar for all the ages investigated. K(+)-stimulated efflux of GLU and GABA was Ca++ dependent, but this was not the case for spontaneous GLU efflux. These data indicate that, in the guinea pig hippocampus, the GLU neuronal system is developing throughout gestation, whereas the GABA neuronal system appears to mature before the brain growth spurt.

Stimulators of antagonism are proposed to use for development of new biopreparations, that enhance the protective ability of normal Qora and the e*ciency of probiotics. Key words: colonization resistance, antagonism, Lactobacillus , associative microorganisms, probiotic, prebiotic. В природных условиях бактерии обитают не обосо-бленно, а в составе сообщества, поэтому свойства бактерий, следовательно, и их функции в присутствии других микро-организмов, могут изменяться, что диктует необходимость в исследовании свойств микроорганизмов при межмикроб-ных взаимодействиях. Антагонизм – тип симбиотических отношений между организмами, в результате которых один из участников взаимодействий (антагонист) получает се-лективное преимущество в борьбе за выживание за счет конкурентных свойств: высоких ростовых и адаптацион-ных возможностей, продукции антибиотических веществ. Антагонистические свойства бактерий являются одним из механизмов колонизационной резистентности биотопа [14], а также используются при получении противоинфекцион-ных средств.Исследование антагонизма в условиях межмикроб-ных отношений позволило нам обосновать положение, что антагонистическая активность (АА) штамма – результат

2398605198	On tricholeucocytes (hairy cells) separated from peripheral blood and bone marrow of patients with trichocellular leukaemia the author detected by means of monoclonal antibodies, using the indirect immunofluorescence method, membrane phenotypes. From the results it may be concluded that tricholeucocytes from all examined 19 specimens had membrane phenotypes (mIg, HLA-D, CD 19, CD 20, CD 22) typical for some cells of the B lymphoid series. Moreover, on tricholeucocytes also antigens typical for the monocytic series (CD 11a, CD 11b) were found and some general leucocytic antigens (CD 43 and CD 45).
2398605341	Type 2 diabetes (T2D) has reached epidemic proportions worldwide. Recent scientific investigations support that T2D is fundamentally tied to changes in mitochondrial content or oxidative capacity in insulin-sensitive tissues and in pancreas of insulin-resistant patients [1-2]. Mitochondria-directed therapy could prove an effective way to prevent and/or treat diabetes, insulin resistance and diabetes complications. Poxel develops Imeglimin, a phase-3 ready novel oral antidiabetic agent, having already shown its safety and efficacy in 14 clinical trials, exposing over 800 subjects [3-4]. Imeglimin was shown to regulate mitochondrial bioenergetics by redirecting substrate flows towards complex 2 of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Imeglimin slightly inhibits complex 1 and restores complex 3 activities, suggesting an increase in fatty acid oxidation. Moreover, Imeglimin decreases Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production linked to the reverse transport of electrons from complex 2 to complex 1, protecting the mitochondria from ROS deleterious effects. By improving mitochondrial function, Imeglimin restores the organs’ sensitivity to glucose and insulin, leading to: a glucose-dependent insulin secretion increase; a glucose excess production decrease; and an increase in glucose uptake and use [5]. Poxel long-term goals are to confirm Imeglimin's clinical effectiveness and full mechanism-of-action in diabetic patients and advance it as a standard-of-care treatment.
2398605374	Prostate cancer is the second leading cancer in men world-wide. Due to its heterogeneous nature, a considerable amount of research effort has been dedicated in identifying effective clinical biomarkers with a focus on proteins, messenger RNA and microRNAs [1]. However, there is limited data on the role and expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) in prostate cancer exosomes [2]. This array dataset which is linked to our publication describes the profiling of human lncRNAs in prostate cancer and their exosomes from five different cell lines [3]. From this dataset, we identified a list of statistically significant prostate cancer lncRNAs which are differentially expressed in the exosomes compared to their parent cell lines. This dataset has been deposited into Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE81034).
2240742287	The regulation of growth differs between fetal and postnatal life. The growth of the fetus in late gestation is primarily determined by the availability of substrate and by the degree of maternal constraint on growth. The fetus does not grow to its maximal potential and the role of hormones in the regulation of fetal growth must be seen as that of mediating the interaction between limited substrate availability and the genetic drive to grow (see Gluckman and Liggins 1984; Gluckman 1986 for review). By contrast, after weaning the postnatal organism is able to grow to its genetic potential, because the availability of substrate is not normally limiting. Endocrine factors are thus acting to co-ordinate the growth of the postnatal organism to its maximum potential. It is therefore to be expected that the status of the somatotropic axis, the major endocrine axis involved in the regulation of growth, will differ between fetal and postnatal life.
2240742691	Picea pungens is the best known of the exotic species belonging to the Picea genus and also the most popular species spread in the landscape of our country. In terms of this species growth and development in our climatic conditions, there are no more researches or bibliographic references in the literature. The aim of this study is the completion of biometric measurements, performed on specimens from 5 different locations of the country.
2240742783	The development of greenhouse leaf yellowing in Easter lilies (Lilium longiflorum Thunb.) was significantly reduced by the application of growth regulator solutions containing gibberellins 4 and 7 (GA 4+7 ) or benzyladenine (BA). Solutions containing BA alone significantly reduced leaf yellowing on plants caused by close spacing but were less effective than GA 4+7 . Application of BA alone, however, was not effective against root rotinduced leaf yellowing. When plants were treated with GA 4+7 or BA + GA 4+7 around the visible bud stage, nearly all of the leaves remained green until the end of the growing season. These growth regulators, however, increased the final height of the plants by 8-10 cm. The developmental rate and size of the flower buds, as well as the length of the pedicels were not affected by the growth regulator treatments. Thus application of these growth regulators greatly improved the quality of the leaves without compromising the quality and timing of the flowers. Chemical name used: N-(phenylmethyl)-1H-purine-6-amine (benzyladenine, BA).
2398605454	For laboratory diagnosis of sodium chloride poisoning, the concentration of chlorides was polarographically determined in the liver of minks (seven-month-old and older), polar and silver foxes (eight-month-old and older), coypus (nine to ten month old), turkeys (three-month-old), and pheasants. The physiological concentration of sodium chloride in the liver of mink (n = 32) is 2.47 to 3.64 g kg-1, polar foxes (n = 30) 2.46 to 4.23 g kg-1, silver foxes (n =3) 3.27 to 3.44 g kg-1, coypu (n = 23) 1.79 to 3.05 g kg-1, turkeys (n = 30) 1.0 to 2.1 g kg-1, and pheasants (n = 28) 0.95 to 2.37 g kg-1. The exposure of the organism of a pheasant to single lethal doses of common salt (3.4 and 5 g NaCl per kg 1. w.) resulted in a 2.5- to 6-fold increase of salt concentration in liver, as compared with physiological concentration. A decreased concentration of sodium chloride (lower than the physiological standard) was found in the liver of deceased lactating minks.
2398605538	"Pasteurella anatipestifer has been associated with a septicemic disease in turkeys (14) and white Pekin ducklings (3,4,6,7,12). This condition has been called ""infectious serositis,"" ""duck septicemia,"" ""anatipestifer syndrome,"" and ""new duck disease."" The infection in turkeys occurred in one flock reared in close proximity to white Pekin ducks. No report was found of P. anatipestifer as a cause of disease in other avian species in the United States. P. anatipestifer infection of chickens has recently been reported in Australia (13). Goose influenza caused by P. septicaemia has not been reported in North America. The organism is known to be pathogenic for geese only (9). It has been suggested that this disease in geese is the same as infectious serositis in ducks and that the etiologic agents are the same. These organisms have not been completely characterized (1,4,6,9), so further study in this area is indicated. The lesions have been studied extensively (3,7,10,11), and a thorough survey of literature on the ""anatipestifer syndrome"" has been presented (8)."
2398605759	Abstract A recombinant yeast Pichia pastoris carrying the gene encoding epoxide hydrolase (EH) of Rhodotorula glutinis was constructed and used for producing (S)-styrene oxide by enantioselective hydrolysis of racemic mixtures of styrene oxides. The EH gene was obtained by PCR amplification of cDNA of R. glutinis and integrated into the chromosomal DNA of P. pastoris to express EH under the control of AOX promoter. The recombinant yeast has a high hydrolytic activity toward (R)-styrene oxide as 358 nmol min−1 (mg cell)−1, which is about 10-fold higher than that of wild type R. glutinis. When kinetic resolution was conducted by the recombinant yeast at a high initial epoxides concentration of 526 mM that constitutes an epoxide–water two-liquid phase, chiral (S)-styrene oxide with an enantiomeric excess (e.e.) higher than 98% was obtained as 36% yield (theoretical, 50%) at 16 h.
2398605823	DL-beta-Hydroxybutyrate (DL-BOHB) is teratogenic to rodent embryos in culture, but the biochemical mechanism(s) responsible for the induction of malformations has not been elucidated. Thus, to delineate a potential mechanism, the interaction of the ketone body with embryonic glucose metabolism was investigated. Mouse embryos were exposed in whole embryo culture to DL-BOHB or each isomer separately during the period of neurulation. The results demonstrate that DL-BOHB inhibits glucose oxidation by the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) with no concomitant effect on Krebs cycle or glycolysis. Furthermore, decreased rates of embryonic uridine monophosphate and DNA synthesis were produced by DL-BOHB, whereas orotate synthesis was unaffected, thereby suggesting that the availability of ribose moieties synthesized by the PPP was compromised. This hypothesis was supported by the observation that addition of ribose to DL-BOHB-containing medium reduced the incidence of ketone body-induced neural tube defects and maintained the rates of DNA synthesis at control levels. Furthermore, these biochemical alterations are due to the synergistic effects of the D and L isomers and may be related to changes in redox states.
2398605941	Susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin was studied in the most frequently isolated Staphylococcus species isolated in the State Hospital Clinic Nr 1 in Warsaw in 1994. No strains resistant to vancomycin were found in two Staphylococci most frequently isolated from clinical material: S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Occurrence of this resistance is very rare and is restricted only to coagulase-negative Staphylococci such as S. xylosus, S. capitis, S. lentus and S. cohni. Resistance to teicoplanin was observed more often (1.4% in S. aureus and from 11.8% to 39.3% in 9 species of coagulase-negative Staphylococci). For the majority of methicillin-susceptible clinical strains (80%), the MBC value did not exceed 4.0 mcg/ml of vancomycin while for almost half of the strains in the population of methicillin-resistant strains MBC values ranged from 32.0 to 128 mcg/ml of vancomycin. Moreover, vancomycin-tolerant strains were found eight times more often in the studied MRSA (26.7%) population than in MSSA strains (3.3%).
2240743340	Four pine forests (6–10, 11–15, 16–20, and 31–40 year-old) located in the Cangshan Mountain and Erhai Lake National Reserve and 7 pine forests (1–5, 6–10, 11–15, 16–20, 21–30, 31–40, and more than 50 year-old) located in the non-protective area near the national reserve were selected. Three replications of each forest was set and a total of 33 sites were investigated. At each site, we quantified 6 habitat variables (species richness, abundance, and percentage of grasses and shrubs coverage respectively at the bottom layer of forests) within randomly determined 5 m × 5 m areas. One hundred cages were set in five lines at each site to trap small mammals, whose species and numbers were recorded. Dominance of Dremomys pernyi and Callosciurus erythraeus in small mammal communities, time niche breadth, and time niche overlap between the two small mammals were calculated, respectively. Step-wise regression was used to analyze the relationship between small mammals and habitat factors. Our results indicated that D. pernyi occurred earlier than C. erythraeus in protective pine forests. D. pernyi was captured in 6–10 year-old forest initially, and C. erythraeus was captured in 16–20 year-old forest initially. D. pernyi and C. erythraeus were captured in the 31–40 and 21–30 year-old forests initially in the non-protective area, respectively. Populations of D. pernyi and C. erythraeus in the 31–40 year-old protective forests were 3 and 3.75 times of those in the same-aged non-protective forests, respectively. Shrubs significantly influenced the populations of the two small mammals. The population of D. pernyi was positively correlated with the density of shrubs; the population of C. allosciurus erythraeus was positively correlated with the coverage of shrubs, and negatively correlated with the coverage of grasses. D. remomys pernyi and C. allosciurus erythraeus were important for pine forests to scatter pine seeds. Human activities in the nonprotective pine forests decreased the vegetation heterogeneity at the bottom layer of pine forests, postponed the occurrence of D. pernyi and C. erythraeus, and decreased the populations of the two small mammals.

2398606486	Abstract The effect of feeding either salinomycin or monensin on feedlot performance and carcass characteristics of yearling cattle was studied. A high-forage diet consisting of corn silage and supplement alone or supplemented with 11.0 g salinomycin or 27.5 g monensin per metric ton of complete feed on a 90% dry matter basis was fed ad libitum for 128 d. Cumulative average daily gains were increased 4 and 7% in monensin- and salinomycin- fed cattle, respectively. A decrease in feed intake for the cattle fed both ionophores occurred during the first 28 d; however, no differences in feed intake were observed during the remainder of the trial. Feed efficiency was improved 5% for the monensin and 8% for the salinomycin treatment. There were no harmful effects observed from feeding either additive, and carcass characteristics did not differ among treatments. These data indicate that both monensin and salinomycin are effective in enhancing both rate of gain and feed efficiency offeedlot cattle.
2398606683	In the growing chloronema cell suspension cultures of the moss Funaria hygrometrica Hedw., activities of several enzymes have been found to be cell-density-dependent. Cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase (cNPDE), nitrate reductase (NR), and protein kinase showed highest activity at a low cell density (1 to 2 milligrams per milliliter) while indoleacetic acid (IAA) oxidase and peroxidase were highest at a high cell density (>10 milligrams per milliliter). 3'-Nucleotidase and the glycolytic enzymes (aldolase, hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, phosphoglucoisomerase, pyruvate kinase, and triose phosphate isomerase) showed no significant dependence on the cell density. Alternatively, if the NR and peroxidase activities were determined as a function of time in batch cultures, their levels were maximal 60 to 70 and 320 hours after subculture, respectively, the corresponding cell densities being 1 to 2 and 23 milligrams per milliliter. The relationship between cell density and NR and peroxidase activities is the same, whether these enzymes are measured in batch cultures during a growth cycle or in the cells cultured at different initial inoculum densities for a constant time. Conventionally enzymic changes have been correlated with growth phases; however, it is felt that the pattern of enzymic activities can also be interpreted as cell-density-dependent. In moss protonema, the dependence of cNPDE, IAA oxidase, and peroxidase on cell density may play an important role in modulating the endogenous levels of IAA and cAMP, both of which regulate the differentiation of specific cell types (Johri and Desai 1973 Nature New Biol 245: 223-224; and Handa and Johri 1976 Nature 259: 480-482).
2398606699	To investigate the clinical and biologic significance of the circulating t(14; 18)-carrying cells in follicular lymphoma (FL) patients, we analyzed the mbr/JH junction of the hybrid bcl-2/lgH gene simultaneously at the DNA and RNA levels by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 37 peripheral blood samples from 37 patients in different remission status: 4 before treatment, 8 during treatment, and 25 in complete remission (CR). Of these 37 patients, 22 were positive either at the DNA or RNA level (8 with active disease and 14 in CR). Among these positive patients, RNA was more often negative for patients in CR (9 of 14 [64%]) than for patients with active disease (2 of 8 [25%]; Fisher’s exact test, P = .09). Among the 14 patients in CR with residual disease, 2 of 5 with RNA positivity relapsed, whereas 1 of 9 with RNA negativity and DNA positivity relapsed with a median follow-up after sample collection of 8 months (range, 4 to 18 months). Simultaneous analysis of the bcl-2/lgH gene at the DNA and RNA level showed heterogeneous patterns of PCR positivity in regards to the evaluation of the biologic activity of the t(14; 18)-carrying cells. A larger study and long-term follow-up will help in determining whether the expression patterns in turn reflect the functional status of disease activity in FL patients.
2398606710	In preparation for embryo implantation and pregnancy, the uterine epithelium undergoes a genomic and biological transition that mediates adhesion and invasion of the blastocyst. These events resemble an inflammatory response, and the immune system likely takes an active role in the establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. Although glucocorticoids are primary mediators of the immune system, the functional role of glucocorticoid signaling in the uterine epithelium is not well defined. To investigate the dynamic relationship between glucocorticoids and reproductive hormones, we performed whole genome microarray analysis in a human uterine endometrial cancer cell line (ECC1 cells) treated with the synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex) alone or in combination with estradiol (E2). Over 10,000 genes were significantly regulated in the presence of dexamethasone and/or estradiol. Surprisingly, unique targets of dexamethasone and estradiol together represented the largest group of genes regulated. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis found both overlapping and independent regulated networks for each hormone. Several hundred genes were found to be co-regulated by dexamethasone and estradiol, including several antagonistically regulated. The effects of glucocorticoids and estradiol are primarily mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and estrogen receptor (ESR1), respectively. In silico promoter analysis revealed that NR3C1 and ESR1 response elements are enriched in antagonistically regulated genes, and signaling through these receptors was required for antagonism. Glucocorticoid and estradiol antagonism of target genes may represent a critical junction between the immune system and female reproductive system. Moreover, identification and ontology analysis of glucocorticoid-regulated genes in the uterine epithelium suggests that glucocorticoid signaling regulates important biological functions, including immune cell trafficking and embryonic development. Summary Sentence: Whole genome microarray analysis of the human uterine epithelial cell line ECC1 reveals widespread transcriptional regulation by glucocorticoids and estradiol and identifies many genes that are targets for both of these steroid hormones.
2398606758	In a previous communication (Wales, Martin, and O'Shea 1965) the number of spermatozoa inseminated, rather than the dilution rate, appeared important in controlling the number oflitters produced. On the other hand Chang (1946) and Cheng and Casida (1948) have indicated that the degree of dilution, rather than the number of spermatozoa, is a factor in determining the number of ova cleaved. The present experiments were undertaken to examine this apparent difference.
2398606861	Lung inflammations in reindeer caused by Pasteurella multocida were reported from Scandinavian countries already at the beginning of this century. Several outbreaks have been recorded in reindeer herds in Norway. Observations made at the fall reindeer slaughtering, and in reindeer herds in Finnmark seem to indicate an endemic state of this infection with subclinical carriers. Predisposing factors and lowered specific immune status may probably play important roles when fatal outbreaks occur.

2398607041	N. meningitidis infections represent a global health problem that can lead to the development of serious permanent sequelae. Although the use of antibiotics and prevention via vaccination have reduced the incidence of meningococcal disease, our understanding regarding N. meningitidis pathogenesis is still limited, especially of those mechanisms responsible for IMD and fulminant or deadly septic shock. These severe clinical presentations occur in a limited number of subjects, whereas about 10% of healthy individuals are estimated to carry the bacteria as a commensal. Since TLR activation is involved in the defense against N. meningitidis, several studies have highlighted the association between host TLR SNPs and a higher susceptibility and severity of N. meningitidis infections. Moreover, TLR SNPs induced variations in immunological responses and in their persistence upon vaccination against meningococcal disease. In the absence of mass vaccination programs, the early identification of risk factors for meningococcal disease would be recommended in order to start immunization strategies and antibiotic treatment in those subjects carrying the risk variants. In addition, it could allow us to identify individuals with a higher risk for severe disease and sequelae in order to develop a personalized healthcare of high-risk subjects based on their genomic profile. In this review, we have illustrated important preliminary correlations between TLR variants and meningococcal susceptibility/severity and with vaccine-induced immune responses.

2398607276	Cysticercosis and hydatidosis are cyclozoonotic diseases of current importance to both public and animal health authorities throughout the world. Taenia taeniaeformis in the field is cycled through rodents (rats and mice) as intermediate hosts while the cat serves as the definitive host in a predator-prey relationship. The intermediate host becomes parasitized after the ingestion of infective eggs. Taeniid parasites possess the capacity to stimulate a strong immune response to the invasive larval stages, a response which is capable of destroying an infective challenge but seems incapable of eliminating the established parasites of the primary infection. At present the mechanisms by which these parasites are able to evade the efferent arm of the immune response remain undetermined. However, the natural host-parasite relationship offered by the experimental model of taeniasis, Taenia taeniaeformis in the rat, provides a means to experimentally examine both the host's response to the parasite as well as the parasite's response to the host in an effort to gain further insight into the phenomenon of prolonged survival.
2398607295	We have previously reported that compared to a corn oil diet a fish oil diet (5% by weight) fed to B10R.III mice before the induction of collagen induced arthritis markedly reduced disease severity. In this study we determine whether a fish oil diet could reduce the severity of collagen induced arthritis if begun after the arthritis was clinically apparent. Mice were initially fed either a fish oil or corn oil diet and immunized with bovine type II collagen 4 weeks later. At the onset of collagen-induced arthritis, half of the corn oil fed mice were switched to fish oil and arthritis assessed on a weekly basis. Four weeks after the diet change until killing 5 weeks later, the mice switched to fish oil developed much less severe arthritis than the corn oil fed controls. Thus the severity index of corn oil fed mice ranged between 9.4 and 7.1; the severity index of fish oil fed mice was between 6.8 and 4.3 while the mice switched to fish oil ranged between 7.2 and 5.6. Analysis of peritoneal macrophages 13 weeks after immunization showed that macrophages from fish oil fed mice incorporated eicosapentaenoic acid into phospholipids and produced less arachidonate products than corn oil fed mice. There was no difference between macrophages obtained from mice switched from corn oil to fish oil and those maintained on fish oil with respect to fatty acid composition of membrane phospholipids or prostaglandin profile. These results suggest that arthritis severity may be modulated after the onset of CIA by altering the PG profile of macrophages present at inflammatory sites.

2398607656	To complete its life cycle, the hepatitis C virus (HCV) induces changes to numerous aspects of its host cell. As kinases act as regulators of many pathways utilized by HCV, they are likely enzyme targets for virally induced inhibition or activation. Herein, we used activity-based protein profiling (ABPP), which allows for the identification of active enzymes in complex protein samples and the quantification of their activity, to identify kinases that displayed differential activity in HCV-expressing cells. We utilized an ABPP probe, wortmannin-yne, based on the kinase inhibitor wortmannin, which contains a pendant alkyne group for bioconjugation using bioorthogonal chemistry. We observed changes in the activity of kinases involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway, apoptosis pathways, and cell cycle control. These results establish changes to the active kinome, as reported by wortmannin-yne, in the proteome of human hepatoma cells actively replicating HCV. The observed changes include kinase activity that affect viral entry, replication, assembly, and secretion, implying that HCV is regulating the pathways that it uses for its life cycle through modulation of the active kinome.
2398607864	Adult tissue homoeostasis requires continual replacement of cells that are lost due to normal turnover, injury and disease. However, aging is associated with an overall decline in tissue function and homoeostasis, suggesting that the normal regulatory processes that govern self-renewal and regeneration may become impaired with age. Tissue-specific SCs (stem cells) lie at the apex of organismal conservation and regeneration, ultimately being responsible for continued tissue maintenance. In many tissues, there are changes in SC numbers, or alteration of their growth properties during aging, often involving imbalances in tumour-suppressor- and oncogene-mediated pathways. Uncovering the molecular mechanisms leading to changes in SC function during aging will provide an essential tool to address tissue-specific age-related pathologies. In the present review, we summarize the age-related alterations found in different tissue SC populations, highlighting recently identified changes in aged HFSCs (hair-follicle SCs) in the skin.
2398607910	Interfungal interactions are common in both the ancient fungal lineages and in the most evolutionary derived “high” fungi. In this chapter, we focus on the most recent reports on genome-wide investigations of mycotrophic fungi. We reveal unique features that are present in intracellular mycoparasitic Cryptomycota and outline similar and apparently convergent mechanisms employed by a diversity of fungicolous Asco- and Basidiomycota. The potential benefits and pitfalls of applications of mycoparasitic fungi for protection of agricultural crops are discussed.
2398608032	A method for detecting a target nucleic acid in a sample, which method comprises: (a) providing a primer air comprising a first primer having a target specific sequence complementary to the sequence of the first strand of said target nucleic acid and an overhang sequence unrelated to said target nucleic acid sequence and a second primer having a target specific sequence complementary to the sequence of the second strand of said target nucleic acid and an attachment means; (b) contacting a nucleic acid sample with said first and second primers; (c) carrying out a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under conditions suitable for the formation of a product having said attachment means and a sequence comprising the sequence of said target nucleic acid and the sequence of said overhang; (j) separating the first strand of said product comprising said first primer from the second strand of said product comprising said second primer using said attachment means; and (k) detecting said first strand or said second strand thereby detecting whether said target nucleic acid is present in said sample.
2398608087	Cytochrome P450 epoxygenases and hydroxylases play a regulatory role in the activation and suppression of inflammation by generating or metabolizing bioactive mediators. CYP2C and CYP2J epoxygenases convert arachidonic acid to anti-inflammatory epoxyeicosatrienoic acids, which have protective effects in a variety of disorders including cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome. CYP4A and CYP4F hydroxylases have the ability to metabolize multiple substrates related to the regulation of inflammation and lipid homeostasis, and it is a challenge to determine which substrates are physiologically relevant for each enzyme; the best-characterized activities include generation of 20-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid and inactivation of leukotriene B4. The expression of hepatic drug-metabolizing cytochrome P450s is modulated by cytokines during inflammation, resulting in changes to the pharmacokinetics of prescribed medications. Cytochrome P450s are therefore the focus of intersecting challenges in the pharmacology of inflammation: not only do they represent targets for development of new anti-inflammatory drugs but they also contribute to variability in drug efficacy or toxicity in inflammatory disease. Animal models and primary hepatocytes have been used extensively to study the effects of cytokines on cytochrome P450 expression and activity. However, it is difficult to predict changes in drug exposure in patients because the response to inflammation varies depending on the disease state, its time course, and the cytochrome P450 involved. In these circumstances, the development of endogenous markers of cytochrome P450 metabolism might provide a useful tool to reevaluate drug dosage and choice of therapy.
2398608271	Comparative investigations were carried out with local velogenic strains (2 viscerotropic--Haskovo and Bregovo, and neurotropic--Rosa and Toutrakan) and 6 standard strains of the Newcastle disease virus, belonging to various pathogenic groups, in tissue cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts. The four local strains as well as the velogenic one (The. GB) and the mesogenic standard strains (Komarov, Roakin, and Hertfordshire) were reproduced in such cultures, producing a clear cytopathic effect without preliminary adaptation passages. The two strains studied parallel to the others, that were of velogenic pathogenic type (La Sota and Hitchner B1) did not produce cytopathogenic effect, and the cultural liquids did not poses agglutination activity with regard to chicken erythrocytes. The average infection titers in tissue cultures of chick embryo fibroblasts (TCID50) for the particular strains in an experiment varied in a wide range and proved higher with the velogenic (regardless of the fact that they belonged to the viscero- and neurotropic pathogenic type) that with the mesogenic strains. The TCID50/cm3 titer ratio of the strains with regard to their corresponding infection titers in chick embryos (EID50/cm3) also varied in a wide range, but invariably in favour of EID50. The latter was more strongly expressed for the mesogenic strain than for the velogenic pathotype strain of the Newcastle disease in experimental conditions.
2398608431	Orius minutus (L.) (Heteroptera: Anthocoridae) is a natural enemy of agricultural pests such as thrips, aphids, and various newly hatched insect juveniles. In this study, we conducted 1) behavioral assays for evidence of contact sex pheromone activity in trails of O. minutus, and 2) chemical analysis to identify the essential chemical components of the trails. Males showed arrestment to trails of mature virgin females but not to trails from either conspecific nymphs or immature females. Females also showed arrestment to trails from conspecific males, although the response was weaker than that exhibited by males. The activity of female trails lasted for at least 46 h after deposition. Males showed a response irrespective of mating experience. Following confirmation that a contact sex pheromone was present in the trails of female O. minutus, we used a bioassay-driven approach to isolate the active chemicals. After fractionation on silica gel, the n-hexane fraction was found to be biologically active to males. A major compound in the active fraction was (Z)-9-nonacosene; this compound was found only in trail extracts of mature virgin females. Synthetic (Z)-9-nonacosene arrested O. minutus males, indicating that it is the major active component of the contact sex pheromone in the trails of female O. minutus.
2398608465	Enterococci are Gram-positive bacteria that are found in plants, soil and as commensals of the gastrointestinal tract of humans, mammals, and insects. Despite their commensal nature, they have also become globally important nosocomial pathogens. Within the genus Enterococcus, Enterococcus faecium, and Enterococcus faecalis are clinically most relevant. In this review, we will discuss how E. faecium and E. faecalis have evolved to become a globally disseminated nosocomial pathogen. E. faecium has a defined sub-population that is associated with hospitalized patients and is rarely encountered in community settings. These hospital-associated clones are characterized by the acquisition of adaptive genetic elements, including genes involved in metabolism, biofilm formation, and antibiotic resistance. In contrast to E. faecium, clones of E. faecalis isolated from hospitalized patients, including strains causing clinical infections, are not exclusively found in hospitals but are also present in healthy individuals and animals. This observation suggests that the division between commensals and hospital-adapted lineages is less clear for E. faecalis than for E. faecium. In addition, genes that are reported to be associated with virulence of E. faecalis are often not unique to clinical isolates, but are also found in strains that originate from commensal niches. As a reflection of more ancient association of E. faecalis with different hosts, these determinants Thus, they may not represent genuine virulence genes but may act as host-adaptive functions that are useful in a variety of intestinal environments. The scope of the review is to summarize recent trends in the emergence of antibiotic resistance and explore recent developments in the molecular epidemiology, population structure and mechanisms of adaptation of E. faecium and E. faecalis.
2398608935	We conducted a case-control study in a Chinese population, and assessed whether the VEGF -634G/C, +936C/T, and +1612G/A polymorphisms could affect the risk of osteosarcoma and its association with environmental factors. A total of 180 consecutive osteosarcoma patients and 360 controls were included in our study. The genotypes of VEGF -634G/C, +936C/T, and +1612G/A were determined by the polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. Conditional logistic regression analyses showed that subjects carrying the GG genotype and the G allele of VEGF -634G/C were significantly associated with increased risk of osteosarcoma compared to those with the CC genotype; the ORs (95%CIs) were 2.28 (1.31-3.96) and 1.51 (1.16-1.97) for the GG genotype and G allele, respectively. We found that the GG genotype of VEGF -634G/C was associated with a significantly increased risk of osteosarcoma in patients of either gender with younger age and a family history of cancer. In summary, this study found that the VEGF -634G/C gene polymorphism was associated with an increased risk of osteosarcoma.
2398609090	The present invention relates to compositions and methods for the handling of processed sperm including samples that are freshly collected, those transported as fresh samples, samples that are frozen and thawed, those sorted into one or more subpopulations, and those that are otherwise processed or handled that impose trauma on the cell.

2240744858	Several gene variants have been associated with an increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes. Variants within the TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7-like 2) gene show some of the largest effects to date. It is likely that additional gene variants for susceptibility to diabetes will be discovered.
2398609274	"The fundamental concept of a neuroimmunological network is well appreciated although detailed description of the individual mechanisms has not yet been attained. In an effort to close this gap, the effect of electrolesion of the frontal medial cortex, a structure with the known ""immunoreactivity"", on selected phenotypic features of spleen macrophages was studied. Since sugar receptors (lectins) are pivotal for recognition, custom-made tools termed neoglycoproteins were employed to delineate any injury-induced changes of their expression. The total number of macrophages in the spleen red pulp was assessed using the ED-1 monoclonal antibody. The results showed that after lesion of the medial frontal cortex, the extent of expression of carbohydrate-binding sites in red pulp spleen macrophages significantly decreased without affecting the total number of these cells. These data intimate that distinct brain regions are involved in the control of the phenotype of macrophages in the central lymphoid organs by currently elusive biochemical mechanisms."
2398609399	OBJECTIVE: To observe the CA repeat polymorphism of the type I angiotensin II receptor gene on Chinese Han people, and evaluate the genetic linking to hypertension. METHODS: The CA repeat polymorphism at 3'-flanking region of AT1R gene was studied by amplified fragment length polymorphism (Amp-FLP ) in Chinese Han people from Shandong and Xi'an. RESULTS: There were 9 alleles ranging from 130bp to 146bp in all subjects. The allele frequencies were 0.01 to 0.38, and allele A4 was more frequent in the control. The heterozygosity of CA repeat locus was 0.789, the polymorphic information content, 0.746. There was no significant difference in distribution of CA repeat polymorphism genotype between different regions in same ethnic (P>0.05), but the allele frequency of CA repeat polymorphism in hypertensive group was significantly different from that of control (P<0.05). There was no detectable distortion from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in both groups. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that CA repeat polymorphism of AT1R gene be associated with Chinese Han hypertensive people.
2398609442	The effect of varying levels of beta 2-adrenergic receptor (beta AR) expression on the capacity of the receptor to activate adenylyl cyclase through regulatory G proteins has been systematically explored in this paper, using differential expression of hamster and human beta AR in L cells. Equations have been developed based on the cycle of G protein activation first proposed by Cassel and Selinger and the mobile receptor model, which assumes that hormone-bound beta AR can stimulate a number of different adenylyl cyclase moieties through the G protein during a single cycle of activation. These equations predict the relationship of receptor number to the EC50 (potency) and Vmax (efficacy) for adenylyl cyclase activation. L cell clones were selected with stable expression of the beta AR over a 2000-fold range of levels (from 5 to 10,000 fmol/mg of membrane protein). Experimentally determined values for the EC50 and the Vmax for epinephrine stimulation of adenylyl cyclase over the entire range of receptor levels were found to be in excellent agreement with predictions of the traditionally accepted models. A method is introduced that allows calculation of beta AR coupling efficiency while taking into account the effect of variable receptor levels. The approach provides a quantitative means for the determination of coupling efficiency of the receptor/G protein/adenylyl cyclase system over wide variations in receptor levels and allows for a rational comparison of coupling efficiencies of wild-type and mutant receptors when receptor levels differ.
2398609450	OBJECTIVE: Study the role for adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ADSCs) of secretome by adipose tissue and hoped that makes some contributions for the fat regeneration. METHODS: Direct adherent culture methods and the flow cytometry (FCM) were used to isolate and identify ADSCs. Collected the medium that had contained secreted proteins as the conditional medium (CM) and was used to induce ADSCs, chemical medium group as the positive control and normal medium group as the negative control. The formation of lipid drops was observed through the cell morphology, and the reliability was verified through Real-time PCR of the mRNA level in vitro. To test the effect of CM on ADSCs in vivo, the absorbable gelatin sponge was used as a scaffold for ADSCs. RESULTS: FCM ensured that the cultured cells were ADSCs. Significant increased lipid drops and related mRNA levels were observed in induced ADSCs cultured for 4 days, which indicated that the CM could promote the ADSCs differentiate into adipocytes after cultured for 4 days in vitro. The secreted proteins could promote ADSCS differentiate into vascularization tissues in vivo. CONCLUSION: The secreted proteome may contain some growth factors that can promote ADSCs to differentiate into adipocytes and vascularization, which may give new directions for the growth factors that could be applied in the repair of soft tissue.
2398609562	A new and distinct cultivar of Verbena plant named ‘Balazmawite’ characterized by its white-colored flowers, medium green-colored foliage, good basal branching, and vigorous, spreading growth habit.
2398609672	ABSTRACTOur objective was to determine the combined effect of some plant growth regulators and nitrogen (N) on corn growth, yield and nitrogen use efficiency. A potted experiment was conducted with two levels of growth regulators [i.e. with or without treatment with Seed king (Kinetine), Root king (Indole-butyric acid) and More king (Chitosan)], two maize cultivars (Calabar White and Obatanpa-98 and three nitrogen rates (0, 90 and 180 kg/ha in the form of urea). The measured parameters were growth attributes, nitrogen uptake, dry matter yield, harvest-index, shoot to root ratio, yield attributes and agronomic and physiological nitrogen use efficiency. Calabar White had taller plants (154.53 cm) more leaves (12.00) and larger leaf area (466.98 cm2) than obatanpa-98 at 6 weeks after sowing. The dry matter yield of both leaf and stem increased significantly (P ≤ 0.05) with increasing N rates but the growth regulators significantly (P ≤ 0.05) increased only the leaf dry matter. The interaction between growth ...
2240745411	Glioblastoma is a therapeutic challenge as a highly infiltrative, proliferative, and resistant tumor. Among novel therapeutic approaches, proteasome inhibition is very promising in controlling cell cycle and inducing apoptosis. This study investigated the effect of ritonavir, a protease inhibitor of the HIV and a proteasome modulator, on glioma cells. The hypothesis was that proteasome modulation, mainly by only inhibiting proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity, could be sufficient to control tumor progression. The experiments were done on a human glioblastoma-derived GL15 cell line and a rat nitrosourea-induced gliosarcoma 9L cell line. Culturing conditions included monolayer cultures, transplantations into brain slices, and transplantations into rat striata. The study demonstrates that ritonavir, by inhibiting the chymotrypsin-like activity of the proteasome, has cytostatic and cytotoxic effects on glioma cells, and can induce resistances in vitro. Ritonavir was unable to control tumor growth in vivo, likely because the therapeutic dose was not reached in the tumor in vivo. Nevertheless, ritonavir might also be beneficial, by decreasing tumor infiltration, in the reduction of the deleterious peritumor edema in glioblastoma.
2240745521	Many diving animals are capable of engaging in long breath-hold dives. Investigations were undertaken to compare the active tubular transport of organic ions between kidney slices from harbor seals (Phoca vitulina) and rats (control) under anoxia or low pH or both. Para-aminohippurate (PAH) and tetraethylammonium (TEA) were used as a representative organic anion and cation, respectively. The slice-to-medium concentration ratios (S:M) of PAH (congruent to 2.5) in the harbor seal was not altered (unlike in the rat) after 60 min of incubation in a nitrogen atmosphere but was reduced to congruent to 1.0 in the presence of 10(-4) M 2,4-dinitrophenol. Subsequent studies also demonstrated that PAH uptake in the harbor seal was not influenced by pH of the incubation medium over a range of 6.0 to 7.4. In contrast, PAH uptake was very sensitive to the medium pH in the rat, decreasing significantly with reduction in pH. Although the TEA uptake decreased in anoxia in both species, it decreased considerably less in the harbor seal than in the rat (40 vs. 70%). However, TEA uptake decreased significantly at low pH in both species. The magnitudes of increase in intracellular Na and of decrease in intracellular K in anoxia were consistently less in the harbor seal than in the rat, especially at low pH. On the basis of these and other findings reported in the literature, cellular mechanisms for the remarkable ischemic tolerance of the seal kidney are discussed.

2240746104	The mitochondrial (mt) DNA D-loop sequences have been widely used for identification of origin of the breeds in animals. In this study, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) from chicken mtDNA were investigated for identifying breed differences between the two commercial Korean native chicken (KNC) breeds. A total of 566 individual birds were used in this study. Of these, 280 mtDNA sequences were obtained from different chicken breeds. The sequence data indicated that there are 14 mtDNA clades from the 27 nucleotide variations. We also investigated whether the D-loop hypervariable region in chicken mtDNA found four specific SNPs can be used for the breed identification. In addition to our previous study, three more SNPs were also included for discrimination of KNC breeds. Using the seven SNPs markers, the probabilities of breed identification in CCP1 and CCP2 were 78.4% and 90.8%, respectively. The results obtained in this study can help for the consumers when they select the KNC meats.

2398610265	Of 6 species of black flies from 6 water bodies microsporidians P. simulii, P. debaisieuxi and Th. varians are reported only in four species, B. maculata, Sch. pusilla, S. morsitans and S. argyreatum. Peculiarities in the infection of black flies larvae with microsporidians in various types of water bodies within a season were established. Under experimental conditions P. simulii and P. debaisieuxi cause mortality of larvae (68 to 87%) and decrease in the emergence of imago (5 to 19.6%).
2240746255	Health maintenance during the ageing process, which allows for increased longevity, is determined by the preservation of tissue homeostasis at all physiological levels. Healthy ageing depends both on the individual’s genetic make-up and lifestyle factors (Kirkwood, Nature 455:739–740, 2008). The age-related loss of homeostasis and capacity to react appropriately to stress, as a consequence of the deterioration of physiological systems, have been proposed to explain the increase of morbidity and mortality with ageing (De la Fuente, Neuroimmunomodulation 15:213–223, 2008). Although the effects of stressors on behaviour and immunity are very heterogeneous since they depend on type, frequency, duration, intensity, animal models, perception of subject and coping by the stressed animal (Costa-Pinto and Palermo-Nieto, Neuroimmunomodulation 17:196–199, 2010), it has been suggested that immunosenescence is a significant consequence of chronic stress and the actions of stress hormones (Bauer, Neuroimmunomodulation 15:241–250, 2008; Lord et al., Handbook of Immunesenescence, pp 475–498, 2009). Moreover, this age-related impairment of the immune system, in turn, appears to be involved in the increased oxidation and inflammation status that occurs in the ageing process, increasing its rate and representing a vicious cycle of decline (De la Fuente and Miquel, Curr Pharm Des, 15:3003–3026, 2009).
2240746328	At the Misin Biologica de Galicia (CSIC) in Pontevedra (northwestern Spain) a program of germplasm prospection of the species Pisum sativum (pea) was started in 1987. More than 200 accessions are now maintained in the collection, including those supplied by other institutions. Documentation of this collection for breeding purposes is based on agronomic and seed quality traits measured in different environments. In analysis of variance among populations from the collection significant differences were found for most of the quantitative traits measured. These results and knowledge of simple correlations between these quantitative traits are the basis for determining which characters are appropriate for characterizing the germplasm collections of pea.
2240746647	Devido ao maior consumo de alimentos ricos em gordura e um estilo de vida mais sedentario, houve um aumento na incidencia de desordens metabolicas relacionadas ao metabolismo lipidico como a resistencia a insulina, dislipidemias, e sua associacao com doencas cardiovasculares. A alimentacao materna desequilibrada, durante a gestacao e lactacao, pode predispor a prole a doencas durante a vida adulta. Alguns transportadores como o Scavenger Receptor class B type I (SR-BI) e ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) sao descritos como responsaveis pela captacao de colesterol e transporte deste a partir de lipoproteinas, principalmente no transporte reverso de colesterol, sendo denominados receptores antiaterogenicos podendo modificar seu padrao de expressao frente a uma dieta hiperlipidica. Ratas Wistar receberam dieta hiperlipidica (DHL) ou dieta padrao (CTL) desde o desmame, ate a lactacao. Apos o desmame a prole de machos recebeu a dieta padrao ate a 16a semana de vida. Nas maes quanto e na prole foram analisados os seguintes parâmetros: ingestao alimentar, ganho ponderal, perfil lipidico e glicidico. Na prole foi estudada a expressao e localizacao de ABCA1 e SR-BI na placenta, no rim, figado, e intestino delgado em animais com 17 dias pre-natal (E17), 12 dias pos-natal (PN12d) com 8 e 16 semanas pos-natal (PN8s e PN16s). As maes DHL apresentaram: 1) maior ingestao calorica com menor ganho ponderal; 2) aumento glicemico associado a menor producao de insulina nos tres periodos estudados e, 3) aumento nos niveis sericos de triglicerides em M8s. A prole de maes DHL apresentaram menor massa corporal desde E17 ate PN8s, sem que tenha havido diferencas ponderais e na ingestao de racao. PN8s e PN16S apresentaram menor captacao tissular de glicose associada a hiperinsulinemia, e aumento nos niveis sericos de triglicerides com PN16S. Nao houve alteracoes nos niveis de colesterol e HDLcolesterol. Nao foi observada alteracao na expressao de SR-BI e ABCA1 no intestino delgado, placenta enquanto no figado houve uma queda tempo-dependente para ambos transportadores. No rim da prole DHL aos PN12d e PN16s observou-se maior expressao de ABCA1.

2240747036	A new and distinct cultivar of Chrysanthemum plant named ‘Yotiffany’, characterized by its compact, upright and outwardly spreading plant habit; freely branching habit; dense and full plant habit; uniform and freely flowering habit; decorative-type inflorescences with elongated oblong-shaped ray florets; white-colored ray florets; and natural season flowering in early September in the Northern Hemisphere.
2240747081	Membrane proteins have crucial roles in signaling and as anchors for cell surface display. Proper secretion of a membrane protein can be evaluated by its susceptibility to digestion by an extracellular protease, but this requires a crucial control to confirm membrane integrity during digestion. This protocol describes how to use this approach to determine how efficiently a protein is secreted to the outer surface of Gram-negative bacteria. Its success relies upon careful selection of an appropriate intracellular reporter protein that will remain undigested if the membrane barrier remains intact, but that is rapidly digested when cells are lysed before evaluation. Reporter proteins that are resistant to proteases (e.g., maltose-binding protein) do not return accurate results; in contrast, proteins that are more readily digested (e.g., SurA) serve as more sensitive reporters of membrane integrity, yielding more accurate measurements of membrane protein localization. Similar considerations apply when evaluating membrane protein localization in other contexts, including eukaryotic cells and organelle membranes. Evaluating membrane protein localization using this approach requires only standard biochemistry laboratory equipment for cell lysis, gel electrophoresis and western blotting. After expression of the protein of interest, this procedure can be completed in 4 h.
2398610620	The prevalence and level of contamination of Campylobacter were determined for poultry meat taken from small and large retailers in Abruzzo and Molise. Of a total of 392 samples analysed, 160 (40.8%) revealed low-level thermotolerant Campylobacter contamination (0.3-9.3 most probable number [MPN]/g), 17 samples (10.6%) showed a contamination level above 9.3 MPN/g and one sample (0.6%) had 110 MPN/g. Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli were isolated from 81.9% and 32.5% of the samples, respectively. More than one species of Campylobacter were isolated from 23.1% of the positive samples.
2398610718	Besides known genetic aberrations, epigenetic alterations have emerged as common hallmarks of many cancer types, including lung cancer. Epigenetics is a process involved in gene regulation, mediated via DNA methylation, histone modification, chromatin remodeling, and functional noncoding RNAs, which influences the accessibility of the underlying DNA to transcriptional regulatory factors that activate or repress expression. Studies have shown that epigenetic dysregulation is associated with multiple steps during carcinogenesis. Since epigenetic therapy is now in clinical use in hematopoietic diseases and undergoing trials for lung cancer, a better understanding of epigenetic abnormalities is desired. Recent technologies for high-throughput genome-wide analyses for epigenetic modifications are promising and potent tools for understanding the global dysregulation of cancer epigenetics. In this chapter, studies of epigenetic abnormality and its clinical implication in lung cancers are discussed.
2398610932	To detect suppressor T cells to hematopoietic stem cells, growth of granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming cells (CFU-GM) and burst-forming unit (BFU-E) was compared before and after treatment of bone marrow cells with anti-T monoclonal antibodies and complement in 29 patients with aplastic anemia. The anti-T monoclonal antibodies used were 35.1 (CD2), Tp120 (CD6) and ATL27 (not clustered). Treatment of normal bone marrow with anti-T monoclonal antibodies and complement resulted in complete (greater than 99%) lysis of T cells with negligible effects on colony growth. Preincubation of marrow samples with monoclonal antibodies and complement did not enhance CFU-GM or BFU-E colony growth in patients with aplastic anemia. Using this assay, there was no evidence of T cell-mediated inhibition of colony proliferation in any of 29 patients.
2398610951	While the protective role HSPs (Heat Shock Proteins) has been recognized against physiological stress such as heat shock, heavy metals and glucose starvation, recent progress has revealed another aspect of HSPs in various diseases. HSP27 has been shown to be involved in the acquired resistance of tumor cells hyperthermic and chemotherapeutic treatment. In human breast tumors, overexpression of HSP27 is associated with a shorter disease-free survival period. HSP47 is thought to be a collagen specific molecular chaperone. The involvement of HSP47 in the progression of fibrosis has been reported. Aberrant expression of HSP could cause various autoimmune diseases. Manipulation of HSP expression, therefore, could be a therapeutic target to reduce HSP-derived detrimental cellular effects. Flavonoids are a widely distributed group of plant substances, universally present in vascular plants. Although the flavonoids have been known as natural plant products as long as the alkaloids, their pharmacological effects and potential medicinal uses have been little studied by comparison. Today, the picture has changed and the biological and pharmacological activities of plant flavonoids look promising. We investigated the effect of flavonoids on the expression of HSPs in human tumor cell lines. Flavonoids inhibited the expression of HSP27, HSP47, HSP60 and HSP72/73. The results suggested the pharmacological possibilities of flavonoids in diseases derived from abnormal expression of HSPs.
2398611120	Fibroblast-pneumonocyte factor (FPF) is an organ-specific differentiation factor produced, under glucocorticoid regulation, by the fetal lung fibroblast, which in turn enhances the differentiation of the alveolar type II cell with respect to surfactant production. In this article we review the appearance of the type II cell phenotype during fetal life and the action of FPF to time full acquisition of this phenotype. Evidence supporting a physiological role for this factor is reviewed as are details of its production by the fetal lung fibroblast and action on the type II cell. Finally we summarize possible future clinical advantages of using such a material to regulate lung maturation compared with currently used maternal glucocorticoid therapy. These include a more rapid effect and bypassing the inhibition of glucocorticoid action seen in male fetuses and in infants of diabetic mothers.
2398611122	We investigated the development of cell-mediated immunity in lethal and non-lethal malarial infections by assaying the cytotoxic activity of spleen cells for L929 tumour cells at different times after infection of mice with the lethal P. berghei, a lethal variant of Plasmodium yoelii and the non-lethal P. yoelii and P. chabaudi. In all cases the cytotoxicity increased to a peak during the first week and then diminished but the time of the peak varied with the infection; its activity was lowest with P. berghei. A second peak occurred in the non-lethal infections at the time of recovery. A protective vaccine accelerated and enhanced the early peak of cytotoxicity. The activity was mediated by adherent phagocytic cells, probably through the release of tumour necrosis factor (TNF) by macrophages since it was inhibited by antiserum against recombinant mouse TNF and did not destroy TNF-resistant L929 cells. Its induction was not dependent on T cells since it occurred in T cell-deficient mice infected with non-lethal P. yoelii. However, the accelerated increase associated with vaccination could be adoptively transferred by spleen lymphocytes from vaccinated mice.
2398611267	The characterization of TCR gamma/delta gene diversity in peripheral blood lymphocytes and in cerebral white matter of MS patients was performed. In overwhelming majority of MS cases the V delta-J delta junctional repertoire was restricted as evidenced by oligoclonal rearrangements concerning V delta 1-J delta 1, V delta 2-J delta 1, V delta 3-J delta 1, V delta 5-J delta 1. The obtained results indicate, that the restricted pattern of TCR gene rearrangement may suggest oligoclonal expansion of certain clones of gamma/delta T cells that may be involved in recognition of putative autoantigen, significant in the etiopathogenesis of MS. The very striking positive correlation between monoclonal pattern of V delta-J delta rearrangement in peripheral blood and cerebral white matter of MS patients indicate that the gamma/delta T lymphocytes play significant role in MS pathogenesis.

2398611470	CD8+ T-lymphocyte populations may be expanded in the peripheral blood of patients with chronic idiopathic neutropenia and may be involved in suppression of granulopoiesis. In this report, we have analyzed the T-cell receptor (TCR) used by the T lymphocytes of a patient with chronic severe neutropenia. Using specific oligonucleotides in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify cDNA specific for the different families of the V alpha, V beta, and V delta TCR genes, and monoclonal antibodies (MoAbs) to examine T-lymphocyte subsets and their TCR, a persistent expansion of CD3+CD8+ T lymphocytes and a reduced repertoire of TCR V alpha and V beta genes were found in the patient9s peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) preparations. A predominant portion of the T lymphocytes expressed a unique TCR structure. Thus, we found that, despite the fact that 98% of the T cells expressed alpha beta TCR on the surface membrane and less than 2% expressed tau delta TCR, nonetheless, 40% to 60% of the T cells stained positively with anti V delta 1 MoAb. Using the PCR analysis, the V delta 1 gene segment was found to be rearranged to C alpha, rather than to C delta genes. The expanded C alpha V delta 1+ cells, which are found only rarely in normal PB, expressed CD8 and were cytotoxic, and the C alpha V delta 1 receptor was functional in cytotoxicity. This constitutes the first description of an expansion of cytotoxic CD8+ lymphocytes expressing a functional “hybrid” C alpha V delta 1 gene in vivo, and suggests a pathogenic role for CD8+ C alpha V delta 1+ cells in some patients with idiopathic neutropenia.
2398611504	Method and apparatus for creating a clone relationship between two or more optical-frequency comb sources (OFCSs). In one embodiment, the invention is an apparatus having (i) first and second OFCSs, each adapted to generate a respective frequency comb, and (ii) means for locking the phases of two comb lines of the first OFCS and the phases of the respective two comb lines of the second OFCS to create a full or partial clone relationship between these two OFCSs. In one system configuration, the locking of the phases of the first and second OFCSs is achieved by locking the phases of two selected comb lines generated by each of these OFCSs to the phases of the respective comb lines generated by the same (third, reference) OFCS. In an alternative system configuration, the locking of the phases of the first and second OFCSs is achieved by locking the phases of two selected comb lines generated by the first OFCS to the phases of the respective comb lines generated by the third OFCS, and locking the phases of two selected comb lines generated by the second OFCS to the phases of the respective comb lines generated by the first OFCS.
2398611534	A Japanese quail embryo cell line transformed by avian retrovirus, designated QERC-31F, was further characterized in virological and cytological aspects. Infectious virus produced by this cell line was found to belong to subgroup A. The virus failed to transform quail embryo cells, whereas it induced erythroblastosis by injection into neonatal quails. Injection of QERC-31F cells into neonatal quails resulted in the induction of solid tumors which morphologically diagnosed as undifferentiated sarcoma. Mitosis of pro-erythrocytic cells with also detected in the peripheral blood of the tumor bearing animals. Antiserum to chicken erythrocyte histone V fraction which was also shown to react specifically with the nucleus of quail erythrocytes stained the nucleus of QERC-31F cells. These results suggested that this cell line maintains characteristics of the erythroblast and possibly produces avian erythroblastosis virus as well as helper virus of subgroup A.
2398611647	Protein kinases play very important role for maintaining viability in prokaryote and eukaryote. The metabolism of prokaryotic cell is generally regulated by bacterial two-component regulatory systems that are composed of histidine and asparitic acid kinases, however, some eukaryotic signal transduction system such as, serine and threonine kinases, have been also found to be involved in the regulation of morphogenesis and physiological differentiation in Streptomyces. Streptomyces griseus, a streptomycin producer, was expected to have varlous types of eukaryotic-type serine/threonine protein kinases, controlling morphogenesis. Thus, many steps of chromatographies were applied to isolate serine and threonine kinases from S. griseus IFO13350. The immunoaffinity steps using anti-phosphoserine, anti-phosphothreonine, and anti-phosphotyrosine agarose column chramatographies were successfully introduced to identify eukaryotic protein kinases from S. griseus IFO13350. Eight proteins with the expected molecular weight of 14, 29, 31, 35, 40, 52, 56, and 60 kDa, were identified on SDS-PAGE, and the their kination activity was confirmed by nonradioactive protein kination assay using FITC-labeled peptide as the substrate.
2398611749	In a previous structure-activity analysis of chlorophenol and nitrophenol toxicity, the pollen tube growth test was shown to discriminate between oxidative uncoupling and narcotic mechanisms of action. To examine the suitability of the use of pollen tubes in screening for narcotic chemicals, we used tobacco pollen suspensions and performed time-course experiments on pollen tube growth inhibition and recovery after exposure to 1-butanol, 2-chloroaniline, 2,4-dichlorophenol and 2,6-dinitrophenol, during pollen culture for 22 hours. After exposure to the chemicals for 2 hours, pollen tubes exposed to 1-butanol and 2,6-dinitrophenol were able to recover, whereas recovery was poor after exposure to 2-chloroaniline and 2,4-dichlorophenol. Dilution experiments to remove the narcotics from the pollen suspension indicated that 2-chloroaniline and 2,4-dichlorophenol accumulated in the pollen grain wall, presumably due to their high octanol/water partition coefficients. Therefore, we suggest that the pollen tube growth test is not suitable for correctly predicting the narcotic potencies of highly lipophilic compounds. In the presence of 1-butanol, pollen grains did not germinate, but became characteristically enlarged. This observation suggests that 1-butanol inhibits the establishment of the cell polarity necessary for initiating pollen tube outgrowth.
2398611928	A method of promoting the more rapid growth of an animal or plant, which comprises administering to said animal, to a food source for said animal, to a plant or to a plant habitat a growth-promoting effective amount of a protease inhibitor such as leupeptin. The protease inhibitor can be incorporated into an animal feed or supplement containing a food base. It apparently functions by inhibiting proteases which degrade proteins, and thus reduce the growth of the host.
2398612510	Cystic echinococcosis (CE), caused by infection with the larval stage of the cestode Echinococcus granulosus , is a chronic zoonosis, to which sheep are highly susceptible. Previously, we found that Kazakh sheep with different MHC haplotypes differed in CE infection. Sheep with haplotype MHCMva Ibc-Sac IIab-Hin 1Iab were resistant to CE infection, while their counterparts without this haplotype were not. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), a class of small non-coding RNAs, are key regulators of gene expression at the post-transcriptional level and play essential roles in fundamental biological processes such as development and metabolism. To identify microRNA controlling resistance to CE in the early stage of infection, microRNA profiling was conducted in the intestinal tissue of sheep with resistant and non-resistant MHC haplotypes after peroral infection with E. granulosus eggs. A total of 351 known and 186 novel miRNAs were detected in the resistant group, against 353 known and 129 novel miRNAs in the non-resistant group. Among these miRNAs, 83 known miRNAs were significantly differentially expressed, including 75 up-regulated and 8 down-regulated miRNAs. Among these known microRNAs, miR-21-3p, miR-542-5p, miR-671, miR-134-5p, miR-26b, and miR-27a showed a significantly higher expression in CE-resistant sheep compared to the CE-non-resistant library, with the FC > 3. Functional analysis showed that they were NF-kB pathway-responsive miRNAs, which are involved in the inflammation process. The results suggest that these microRNAs may play important roles in the response of intestinal tissue to E. granulosus .
2398612516	Dendritic cells (DCs) are professional antigen presenting cells that play a pivotal role in the initiation of immune responses. DCs ingest antigens and then present these antigens to T cells to initiate T cell activation and polarization. DCs receive signals both from environment and from endogenous molecules. DCs in the immune system constantly interact with immunoglobulins (or antibodies) and a substantial amount of these immunoglobulins are natural. We found that natural antibodies have a key role in regulating the DC functions and that CD40-reactive natural antibodies constitute one of the endogenous molecules that provide maturation-associated signals to DCs in physiology. In this chapter, we describe the isolation of anti-CD40 natural antibodies from pooled normal immunoglobulin preparations (intravenous immunoglobulin, IVIg) and their biological effects on human DC maturation and functions.
2398612594	Electropolarity treatment (0.8 V/DC/Cm) was given to the gastrocnemius muscle of Bufo melanostictus every day for 5 min. for 5 days, and kinetic study of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) in muscle and liver was conducted with different effectors - sodium malonate, ethylene diamine tetra acetic acid (EDTA), calcium chloride (CACl2) and sodium citrate. Of the four modulators tested, the malonate and EDTA inhibited while sodium citrate and CACl2 activated the enzyme. The significance of the modulation in SDH activity to different extents was discussed.
2398612647	BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the main mechanism of tumor cell death after irradiation. Homologous recombination (HR) and DNA nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) are two important ways to repair DSB. The catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PKcs), an essential protein of NHEJ, plays a major role during DSB. This study was to investigate the expression of DNA-PKcs in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and analyze its correlation to the clinicopathologic features and prognosis of NPC. METHODS The expression of DNA-PKcs protein in 223 specimens of NPC tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry. The correlation of DNA-PKcs expression to clinicopathologic features and prognosis of NPC were analyzed. RESULTS The overexpression rate of DNA-PKcs in 223 NPC specimens was 36.8%. The expression of DNA-PKcs had no significant correlations to gender, age, pathological type and N staging of NPC (P>0.05), but had remarkable correlations to TNM, T and M staging (P<0.05). The 5-year overall survival rate was significantly lower in the patients with overexpression of DNA-PKcs than in those with low expression of DNA-PKcs (54.6% vs. 79.4%, P<0.05). T, N, M staging and the expression of DNA-PKcs were independent predictors for the overall survival of NPC (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS DNA-PKcs is positively expressed in the majority of NPC tissues. The expression level of DNA-PKcs is an important factor affecting the prognosis of NPC, which could be used as a prognostic predictor for NPC.
2398612696	Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is one of the most important multifunctional cytokines, playing essential roles in mediating the innate and adaptive immune responses. In this study, il-6 gene and its promoter from blunt snout bream, Megalobrama amblycephala, were characterized, and its expression at the transcript level in healthy fish and after bacterial infection was determined by quantitative real-time PCR. The results showed that the M. amblycephala il-6 (Mamil-6) cDNA had an ORF of 699 bp, encoding 232 amino acids, and contained 9 instable motifs in the 3′ UTR. The deduced MamIL-6 possessed a 24-amino acid signal peptide and was located in the cytoplasm. Although sequence alignment and phylogenetic analysis revealed that IL-6 is poorly conserved in vertebrates, the protein and genomic structure of il-6 gene was well conserved. Analysis of the Mamil-6 promoter revealed the presence of a conserved TATA box and six major cis-regulatory elements, including C/EBPβ (NF-IL6), AP-1, CRE, GRE, GATA and NF-κB binding sites. In healthy fish, Mamil-6 was the most abundant in the spleen. After Aeromonas hydrophila infection, Mamil-6 was significantly up-regulated in all 6 immune-related tissues examined, suggesting that Mamil-6 plays an important role in the blunt snout bream immune system.
2398612753	The HL-60 model of myeloid maturation was used to test whether changes in signaling from the granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) receptor accompany maturation-related changes in cellular responses to GM-CSF. Receptor expression, tyrosine phosphorylation, functional activity, and c-fos gene expression were measured. Functional GM-CSF receptors were present throughout differentiation as both uninduced and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-induced HL-60 cells responded to GM-CSF, albeit in different ways. Uninduced promyelocytes proliferated in response to GM-CSF, whereas DMSO-induced cells lost the capacity to proliferate but did respond with increased expression of beta 2-integrins, enhanced respiratory burst activity, and metabolism of arachidonic acid. GM-CSF-stimulated upregulation of c-fos mRNA expression was not detected in immature cells but developed after 2 to 4 days with DMSO in line with a marked increase in responsiveness to stimulation with phorbol ester, showing that increased expression of c- fos is predominantly a feature of mature phagocytes. GM-CSF stimulated the tyrosine phosphorylation of a broadly similar range of proteins in both uninduced and DMSO-treated HL-60 cells, but protein bands were more heavily phosphorylated in DMSO-induced cells. Phosphorylation was rapid in onset and very transient in immature cells. Phosphorylation of several proteins, in particular a 130-kD band, was more sustained in DMSO-induced cells. These differences in signaling were not because of numerical differences in receptors, because reduction of GM-CSF concentration to trigger equivalent numbers of high-affinity receptors delayed the onset of phosphorylation in DMSO-induced cells. We conclude that there are maturation-related changes in signaling downstream from the GM-CSF receptor.
2398612826	Upstream open reading frames (uORFs) are ubiquitous repressive genetic elements in vertebrate mRNAs. While much is known about the regulation of individual genes by their uORFs, the range of uORF-mediated translational repression in vertebrate genomes is largely unexplored. Moreover, it is unclear whether the repressive effects of uORFs are conserved across species. To address these questions, we analyse transcript sequences and ribosome profiling data from human, mouse and zebrafish. We find that uORFs are depleted near coding sequences (CDSes) and have initiation contexts that diminish their translation. Linear modelling reveals that sequence features at both uORFs and CDSes modulate the translation of CDSes. Moreover, the ratio of translation over 5' leaders and CDSes is conserved between human and mouse, and correlates with the number of uORFs. These observations suggest that the prevalence of vertebrate uORFs may be explained by their conserved role in repressing CDS translation.

What has been described as ""chromomeres"" are (a) misinterpretations of gyres of the chromonematic helix (leptotene, somatic prophase); (b) points of overlap of chromonemata (diplotene); (c) heterochromatic sections consisting of more tightly coiled regions of the chromonema. The fundamental unit of the chromosome is a microscopically uniform thread. The longitudinal differentiation of the chromosome is due to differential coiling of this chromonema.2. ""Lamp-brush chromosomes"" are typical diplotene chromosomes, but with tremendously enlongated chromonemata. The side branches are the gyres of the major coils of the individual chromonemata, which have laterally separated from each other."
2398612930	Preliminary data are presented on the differential recognition of Dirofilaria immitis antigens by sera positive for IgG and IgM (detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, ELISA) using the enzyme-linked immunoelectrotransfer technique (EITB). The sera were followed prospectively over a year to detect seasonal variations. IgG mainly recognized antigens with a molecular weight (MW) lower than 74 kDa, while IgM recognized those with a MW higher than 43 kDa. The antigens with MW between 74 and 61 kDa were recognized by both isotypes. In IgG positive sera all bands were recognized throughout the year, albeit more mildly in summer. For IgM it is noteworthy that antigens with a MW between 43 and 20 kDa were not recognized in spring. These data are in accordance with those obtained with ELISA in the seasonal follow-up of positive sera.
3139593287	Ectoparasites are abundant in natural communities, can have pronounced deleterious fitness consequences to their host and are important vectors of transmissible parasitic disease. Yet very few studies have estimated the magnitude of heritable genetic variation underlying resistance against ectoparasitism, which significantly limits our ability to predict the evolution of this ecologically important character. The present paper reports results of artificial selection for increased resistance in Drosophila nigrospiracula against ectoparasitic, haematophagous mites, Macrocheles subbadius. In this system, which occurs naturally in the Sonoran Desert of North America, ectoparasitism significantly damages the expression of host fitness traits, including longevity, fecundity and male mating success. In the present study, resistance, which was modelled as a threshold trait, responded significantly to selection applied on either sex. Realized heritability, calculated as a mean across four replicates, was estimated to be 0.152 ± 0.014 (SE). The heritability estimate from selection on males did not differ from that on females, but both estimates differed significantly from zero. This documented presence of additive genetic variation for resistance, coupled with knowledge of the fitness consequences of ectoparasitism, indicates that the host population possesses significant evolutionary potential. Selection was applied on the pre-attachment phase, thereby targeting behavioural forms of defence. This study therefore establishes parallels between insects and other animals in their ability to protect themselves and evolve behavioural defences against ectoparasites.

3139593849	Activities of individual hippocampal (CA1 area) and neocortical parietal-temporal neurons were compared in active and passive rabbits in negative emotional situations during emotionally significant stimuli by plotting histograms of autocorrelations. As compared to passive animals, in active rabbits, the mean firing rate of hippocampal neurons was higher, bursting and periodic oscillations of discharges occurred more frequently. Oscillation periods in the theta 1 band (6.0-9.0 Hz) appeared more frequently (in the baseline state and active exploratory or defensive reactions), whereas those in the theta 2 band (4.0-5.9 Nz), on the contrary, were infrequently observed (during freezing). The greatest changes in activity ofhippocampal neurons were observed during active locomotor responses of active rabbits. Intergroup differences in neocortical neuronal activities were less pronounced than in hippocampus. The results indicate that individual typological features in behaviour of animals appear in negative emotional situations and are reflected in activity of activity ofhippocampal (area CA1) and to lesser extent parietal-temporal neocortical neurons. The results suggest different activation levels of the septohippocampal system of active and passive rabbits and possible differences in the afferent input to the CA1 field.
3139593908	SUMMARY 1. The value of algal fatty acids (FA) as diet biomarkers for benthic harpacticoid copepods was investigated. A high proportion of 18:1x9 and 18:2x6 FA was observed in the lipid reserve fraction of copepods fed with cyanobacteria. In contrast, a high proportion of 16:1x7 and x3 FA (including eicosapentaenoic) was present in the lipid reserve fraction of copepods grown on diatoms. 2. Copepods that were grown on cyanobacteria showed reduced survival and took 26% more time to develop from the first copepodid stage to adult than copepods that were grown on diatoms. Copepods feeding on the cyanobacteria showed reduced FA content when compared with animals fed with diatoms. This reduction in FA content was more pronounced in the apolar lipid fraction (mainly reserve lipids) than in the polar (mainly structural) lipid fraction. 3. The FA profiles of algae were used to calculate a function discriminating between diatoms and cyanobacteria. This function was applied to the FA profiles in the reserve lipid fraction of copepods and correctly classified copepod diet. 16:1x7, 18:2x6 and 20:5x3 were the most important FA in the discriminant function. The suitability of this chemometric method to infer copepod diet was further tested by using algal class FA data from literature to derive the discriminant functions. The correct classification of the diet when the functions were applied to FA composition of the copepod reserve lipids suggests that this method may be employed in trophic web studies. 18:3x3, 18:1x9 and 16:1x 7w ere the most important FA in the functions discriminating diatoms, cyanobacteria and green algae. The identification and quantification of the whole suit of 16:1x7, 18:1x9, 18:2x6, 18:3x3 and 20:5x3 in trophic web studies is therefore of paramount importance to infer diet origin of aquatic herbivores. 4. The FA profile of copepod polar lipids did not reflect that of the diet. The presence of long chain polyunsaturated FAs in the polar lipid fraction of copepods feeding on the cyanobacterium suggests that C18 FAs from the diet may be elongated and desaturated by the copepod. The ability to elongate and desaturated FAs may reduce the importance of some FAs as diet biomarkers while it may turn the copepods into valuable trophic intermediaries in transferring organic matter from microorganisms to higher trophic levels.
2240749301	Overexpression of genes that modify gibberellin (GA) metabolism and signaling have been previously shown to produce trees with improved biomass production but highly disturbed development. To examine if more subtle types of genetic modification of GA could improve growth rate and modify tree architecture, we transformed a model poplar genotype (Populus tremula × P. alba) with eight genes, including two cisgenes (intact copies of native genes), four intragenes (modified copies of native genes), and two transgenes (from sexually incompatible species), and studied their effects under greenhouse and field conditions. In the greenhouse, four out of the eight tested genes produced a significant and often striking improvement of stem volume, and two constructs significantly modified the proportion of root or shoot biomass. Characterization of GA concentrations in the cisgenic population that had an additional copy of a poplar GA20-oxidase gene showed elevated concentrations of 13-hydroxylated GAs compared to wild-type poplars. In the field, we observed growth improvement for three of the six tested constructs, but it was significantly greater for only one of the constructs, a pRGL:GA20-oxidase intragene. The greenhouse and field responses were highly variable, possibly to due to cross-talk among the GA pathway and other stress response pathways, or due to interactions between the cisgenes and intragenes with highly similar endogenes. Our results indicate that extensive field trials, similar to those required for conventional breeding, will be critical to evaluating the value and pleiotropic effects of GA-modifying genes.
2240749303	The past decades pointed out RNA has alot of functions besides being an information carrier (mRNA). Small RNAs (e.g. antisense RNA) form an essential part of different prokaryotic regulatory mechanisms by, for example, blocking the ribosome binding site (RBS). As such sRNA can be used in synthetically constructed biological devices to silence a gene on demand. Tools and know how for model-based design of RNA molecules that efficiently block the RBS of a specific gene are however still underdeveloped. Here we present a method to design silencing modules that can efficiently block the translational process. This approach uses knowledge on antisense RNA to model the physical nature of this biological interaction. The available literature was used to identify potential characteristics of a good silencing sequence. Based on this information a bioinformatics framework was developed to enable a computational characterization of a potential silencing sequence. Herein, several dynamic programming algorithms are used to accurately predict these RNA-RNA interactions. The influence of the different defined features of the candidate sequences, which were semi-rationally generated and send through a preliminary in silico filter, was investigated. The performance of a group of selected candidate sequences are tested in vivo to determine their silencing capacities. As a test case, mRNA containing a red fluorescent protein was constructed using biofab parts. Based on these results the importance of the features is evaluated. Ultimately, this computational approach can be used for the design of tailor made silencing modules with excellent performance.

2240750077	A85 Introduction: Obesity is associated with increased risk for more aggressive prostate cancer (Pca) as defined by an increase in the risk of Pca death and an increased chance of progression after surgery. Obesity may mediate its effects on Pca in part due to factors secreted from adipose tissue. One factor potentially involved in the interaction between Pca and obesity is adiponectin, also known as adipocyte complement-related protein of 30 kDa (Acrp30). Lower serum Acrp30 levels have been reported for Pca patients compared to patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia or healthy controls. In addition, lower expression levels of Acrp30 receptors are found in prostate tumors as compared to healthy prostate tissue. Here we assessed how Acrp30 impacted cell growth in vitro in the TRAMP-C2 cell line which is derived from a TRAMP prostate tumor and determined Acrp30 receptor expression in the TRAMP model.  >Procedures: TRAMP-C2 cells (ATCC) were used in growth assays (CC8 kit Dojindo Laboratories). Whole cell extracts were obtained using Phosphosafe extraction reagent from Novagen for determination of adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and R2) and signaling proteins by western blot. Antibodies were from Santa Cruz Biotechnology except antibodies to AdipoR1 (Abcam Inc), AdipoR2 (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and anti-rabbit secondary (Cell Signaling Inc.).TRAMP mice were euthanized at 50 weeks and urogenital tracts plus abnormal growths/tumors removed. Sections were stained with the rabbit ABC staining system for AdipoR1 and R2.  >Results: There was a dose-related reduction in proliferation of the TRAMP-C2 cells after 48 hours in response to the addition of Acrp30. The difference in proliferation was statistically significant at physiological Acrp30 concentrations of 10 and 20 ug/ml (Student’s t-test p We also found that tumors from TRAMP mice expressed the two receptors for Acrp30, AdipoR1 and AdipoR2. Using immunohistochemical analysis we found expression of AdipoR1 in prostate tumor tissue from TRAMP mice was mostly in epithelial cells on the apical membrane. AdipoR2 was present in the same areas as AdipoR1 but the staining was lower. Western blot analysis of frozen tissue from the same mice also indicated expression of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in prostate tumor tissue.  >Conclusions: Here,we are the first to report the presence of AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 in prostate tumor tissues from TRAMP mice and in the TRAMP-C2 cell line which is derived from the prostate tumor of a TRAMP mouse. The receptors appear to be functional since proliferation of TRAMP-C2 cells was inhibited by addition of Acrp30. This decrease in cell growth may be attributable to increased signaling through ERK 1/2 since Acrp30 increased the phosphorylation of ERK 1/2. We are currently investigating the levels of Acrp30 in vivo with ongoing mouse studies in relationship to body weight and Pca development. Support from DOD PC 050284 and The Hormel Foundation.
2240750487	In this report, we briefly describe a patient with GM2-gangliosidosis having a deficiency in both isoenzymes of N-acetyl-β-hexosaminidase and displaying several clinical, ultrastructural and enzymatic particularities.

2240751183	Daytime soil CO2 efflux from a mountainous forest-grassland ecosystem in central Taiwan was measured approximately monthly from Oct. 2003 to Oct. 2004. The system featured two zones, each domi- nated by a different vegetation type, one a C4�grass�(Miscanthus transmorrisonensis)�andtheotherahemlock� (Tsuga chinensisvar.� formosana).�TherelationshipbetweenthesoiltemperatureandsoilCO2 efflux of these two zones was also investigated, and seasonal patterns in these two variables emerged. Soil temperature in the grassland zone ranged from 4 to 16°C, and in the hemlock zone from 2 to 15°C. The magnitude of the daytimesoilCO2 efflux varied from 0.6 to 2.2 μmol m -2 �s -1 and from 0.3 to 1.6 μmol m -2 �s -1 for the grassland and forest zones, respectively. Within the same measuring period, the forest zone had significantly lower soil respiration than the grassland zone. Seasonal changes in the soil CO2 efflux of both zones correlated strongly with soil temperature. The average Q10 values, the factor by which the respiration rate differs for a temperature interval of 10°C, calculated from the exponential relation between soil CO2 efflux and soil temperature, were 3.5 and 2.8 for the forest and grassland zones, respectively. The result indicates that the soil CO2 efflux from the forest zone is more sensitive to changes in soil temperature than that from the grassland zone.

2240751314	Integrins are metazoan heterodimeric receptors for cell adhesion and interaction with extracellular matrix. Nowadays 18 integrin alpha chains and 8 beta chains are known in human cells, forming 24 different heterodimers specific for wide array of ligands, including collagens, laminins, and fibronectin. Dynamic assembly and disassembly of ligand-bound integrins as well as rearrangement of unengaged integrins on a cell surface depends on the intracellular trafficking. It is crucial for the processes related to cell adhesion, spreading, and migration, such as neutrophil migration or metastasis development in cancer.  Number of studies addressed endocytosis and recycling of integrins, yet, the comprehensive model of integrin trafficking is still missing as the pathways of integrin retrograde trafficking can differ depending on the integrin activation status, binding to the ligand, growth factors presence. An additional level of complexity dealt in the integrin trafficking studies is a certain promiscuity in integrin α and β chain interactions, therefore the knowledge on the specificity of a trafficking pathway for a certain heterodimer is often lacking.  This study focused on internalization regulators of integrin α2β1, which is a ubiquitously expressed receptor of collagens, mainly collagen I, one of the most abundant extracellular matrix proteins, which is known as a metastasis suppressor in human cancer. Studies on α2β1 endocytosis are sparse and mostly focused so far on the trafficking of α2β1 clustered by addition of virus or ligand.  To identify and characterize novel regulators of internalization of non-clustered integrin α2β1, we established a quantitative fluorescent-microscopy-based integrin α2 internalization assay. We demonstrated that bulk internalization of endogenously expressed non-clustered integrin α2 in HeLa cells is dependent on both clathrin and caveolin1, and occurs via Rab5-, Rab4- and Rab11-positive endosomes. Next, we used RNAi to screen 386 cytoskeleton and cytoskeleton-associated genes for their involvement in integrin α2 internalization. We identified 122 primary screening hits as potential regulators of integrin α2 trafficking, number of which were previously known as regulators of endocytosis, focal adhesion formation, and cell migration, and as direct interactors of integrins. In the validation assays we could reproduce the results of the primary screening for 43% of expressed hits in the two groups of hits selected for validation (14 molecules that were targeted by multiple siRNAs in the primary screening, and 12 kinesin molecular motors). Three validated kinesin hits have never previously been associated with endocytic trafficking events. To get an insight in the function of kinesins in integrin internalization, we further characterized the role of KIF15 in the trafficking of integrin α2. It was identified as a strong inhibitor of the early steps of integrin α2 endocytosis, but not transferrin or EGF. We demonstrated that knock-down of KIF15 lead in re-location of the integrin-specific clathrin adaptor Dab2 from the plasma membrane, which is likely to be the reason for the block of integrin α2 internalization. Taken together, this study establishes the methods to address the internalization of non-clustered integrin α2β1, identifies the number of novel regulators of integrin trafficking, and provides insight into the role of KIF15 molecular motor in the integrin α2 internalization.
3139594333	Objective To investigate mutations at points 13 10,1438 and 1442 of mitochondrial 12S rRNA gene in Chinese type 2 diabete s and screen for new mutations associated with type 2 diabetes in this area. Methods The mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs) of 86 patients with type 2 diabetes and those of 70 normal controls were analyzed using PCR-SSCP and PCR product direct se quencing technique. Results One patient was found with the mitoch ondrial DNA G→A mutation at point 1438, and one with the G→A mutation at point 1442, whereas none of the normal controls was found to have mutation at these t wo points. No C→T mutation at nucleotide pair 1310 of the mito chondrial 12S rRNA gene was identified. Conclusion The G→A muta tion at points 1438 and 1442 is likely to be associated with the development of type 2 diabetes; the occurrence of the C→T mutation at point 1310 is probably rare in the blood cells, and the development of type 2 diabetes may be related to heterogeneity in mitochondrial genetic changes.
2240752242	The protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi is the etiologic agent of Chagas' disease, an illness responsible for morbidity and death among millions of Latin Americans. Mice also develop this disease when infected with T. cruzi and are a useful model organism for the study of parasite-specific immune responses. To identify immunogenic T. cruzi antigens, serum from an infected mouse was used to isolate clones from a T. cruzi epimastigote cDNA expression library. One of these clones was found to encode the 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein (grp78), the endoplasmic reticular member of the 70-kDa heat shock protein (hsp70) family. Like the mammalian and yeast grp78s, the T. cruzi protein contains an endoplasmic reticular leader peptide and a carboxyl-terminal endoplasmic reticular retention sequence. T. cruzi grp78 is encoded by a tandemly arranged family of three genes located on a chromosome of 1.6 Mb. The effects on grp78 expression of heat shock and tunicamycin treatment, the latter of which specifically stimulates mammalian grp78, were investigated. While the level of the grp78 protein remained constant under all circumstances, grp78 mRNA was unaffected by heat shock but induced fivefold by tunicamycin. Finally, we found that grp78 is the most immunogenic of the T. cruzi heat shock proteins we have characterized, reacting strongly in immunoblots with sera from infected mice.
3139594404	Some Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB), when ingested in adequate quantities, are able to positively impact the host, being considered probiotics. To be used, these bacteria must have their identity known and show specific characteristics. In this study, LAB were isolated from unpasteurized milk samples and characterized in vitro for probiotic potential. After isolation, the colonies were analyzed by Gram stain and catalase test; total DNA was extracted, and the 16S rDNA was amplified and sequenced. Phylogenetic analysis was performed to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the isolates. The isolates were evaluated regarding the resistance to acidic pH and the presence of bile salts. The antagonistic activity of the isolated bacteria was evaluated by the overlay test and the antimicrobial susceptibility profile was performed by the disc diffusion method. Of the 13 isolated bacteria, three were characterized as Gram positive and catalase negative rods, showing 99% of identity with Lactobacillus casei, Lactobacillus paracasei , and Weisella paramesenteroides . The isolates showed in vitro resistance to acidic stress and to the presence of bile salts; showed similar antimicrobial resistance profile and ability to inhibit the growth of potentially pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus saprophitycus , Escherichia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Enterococcus faecalis , and Enterococcus faecium . In view of the proven characteristics, the lactic acid bacteria isolated in this work have probiotic potential.
3139594511	Neonatal parental care plays an important role in the development of offspring behavior, but little is known about the effect of post-weaning contact between offspring and parents on locomotory, social and parental behavior. Here, we explore this concept using socially monogamous mandarin voles (Microtus mandarinus). Voles were assigned to live with parents and siblings from the same litter until 45 d (natural dispersal time in the field) or to live with siblings from the same litter after weaning at 21 d (normally
3139594625	DNA methylation plays an important role in the regulation of gene expression during biological development and tissue differentiation in eukaryotes. A methylation sensitive amplification polymorphism(MSAP) including digestion, pre-selective amplification and selective amplification was optimized to compare the levels of DNA cytosine methylation at CCGG sites in muscle, gill and hemocyte from the wild populations and the selective breeding of Huanghai No. 1 of Fenneropenaeus chinensis, respectively. Significant differences in cytosine methylation levels among three tissues in two populations were detected. The average DNA methylation ratios in muscle, gill and hemocyte of the wild population were 23.1%, 22.3% and 19.7%, while those were 21.4%, 19.6%,and 18.9% in Huanghai No. 1, respectively. The DNA methylation levels of gill from the two populations were highly significant(P0.01), the difference of muscle was significant(P0.05), while in hemocyte, there were no significant differences(P0.05). DNA polymorphic methylation of gill and hemocyte between the wild population and Huanghai No. 1 varies to some extent, while those of muscle kept in a balanced degree. Furthermore,polymorphic methylation was associated with demethylation and methylation of CCGG loci.
3139595194	There is a growing trend of consumer preference for the use of natural food preservatives either to prevent the growth of food-borne pathogens, or to delay the onset of food spoilage. In this investigation, an in-vitro screening method was used to determine the antibacterial efficacy of a 10% w/v suspension of the natural leaves of the herb culantro (Eryngium foetidum), against Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Salmonella Typhimurium. The apparent sensitivity of the gram-positive bacteria and resistance of the gram-negative bacteria were distinct. Significant antibacterial activity was evident against S. aureus and B. subtilis, but no apparent antibacterial activity was evident against E. coli and S. Typhimurium. There was approximately 100% kill for both S. aureus and B. subtilis. The results obtained from this investigation suggest that culantro leaves can potentially be used as a food preservative, by increasing the safety and extending the shelf life of food products.
3139595330	Codiaeum variegatum is easily grown under hot and humid field conditions and has a high export potential. However, wilting and senescence during post-harvest operations often reduces its vase-life. To improve this drawback, an investigation was conducted to preserve the export quality of C. variegatum vars. Mariana, Batik and Aucubeafolia. Eight separate experiments were conducted to maintain high quality standards during storage life of three varieties of C. variegatum. Cold treatment with or without hot water dip, leaf morphology, leaf maturity with cutting type, pre-harvest hormonal regulation, de-topping, post-harvest hormonal regulation, commodity treatments and combined treatments of the above were the test criteria.

3139595523	The study was carried out on two highbush blueberry cultivars: Bluecrop and Darrow in 2001 and 2002 seasons. Analyses for phytochemical contents in berries were made during commercial maturity of fruit. Concentration of anthocyanins and low mo- lecular weight thiol compounds was significantly higher inDarrowberries in compari- son to Bluecrop cv., irrespective of the harvest year. Tested cultivars did not differ in the ratio of the reduced form of glutathione in its total quantity. As opposed to this, the higher proportion of the reduced form of ascorbate in its total concentration was noted for ´Bluecrop´, but it was statistically proven only in the first year of research. A very low ac- tivity of antioxidative enzymes was noted, however on the average, considerably higher activity of glutathione reductase showedDarrow´, whereasBluecrophad higher cata- lase activity. The ascorbate peroxidase activity was not detected in the extracts of ´Bluecrops' berries. Berries ofDarrow´, which exhibited, in general, the higher antioxi- dants content in the first year of the study, were harvested at two different dates in 2002: in the middle of July and at the end of August. The harvest date had a significant effect on the level of some phytochemicals. The fruit harvested in August had lower content of cys- teine, glutathione, phenolics, flavonols and anthocyanins than the ones harvested in July. Ascorbate content was similar at both harvest dates. Growing season also had the influ- ence on antioxidant properties, especially on the content of ascorbic acid.
3139595556	Were analyzed the growth and the relationship with soil fertility of genetic materials of Eucalyptus spp. planted in a non-traditional eucalyptus forestry region in Brazil. Five genetic materials were selected, two seminal: Eucalyptus urophylla and E. pellita and three clones: GFMO27, I224, and H13, planted in experimental plots in a completely randomized design. The diameter at breast height (DBH) and total height were measured; basal area and dendrometric variables were calculated, for the ages 24, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 108 months, both statistically compared. The soil was chemically characterized at 108 months of age and correlated with dendrometric variables. The growth of clones H13, I224, and GFMO 27 were superior to the E. pellita and E. urophylla. The levels of N and MO had a significant correlation with the volume and the Al+3 showed a positive correlation with DBH. Clone H13 showed higher values than the other materials, in all variables analyzed, reaching an individual volume of 1.27 m³ at 108 months. The other genetic materials (GFMO27, I244, and E. urophylla) proved to be variable in their growth behavior at different ages, and E. pellita had lower growth. The recommended genetic materials for planting are H13 and E. urophylla.
3139595629	Background: Far-Western Terai Region of Nepal is a large source of floral diversity. Most of the plants are medicinal and available as wild or weeds. Weeds are unwanted plants and competing with crop plants for common resources (water, mineral nutrients, space, and light) and reduce the yield of wanted plants. However, the weeds and their medicinal properties were scarcely documented. The aim of the present study was to explore the diversity of commonly used weeds of Kanchanpur district, to be precise on cataloguing the indigenous knowledge how local weeds are managed and utilized by local people.Methods: The study district is border to India at southwestern part of the country. The information of weeds and their medicinal uses was collected by using semi-structured questionnaires in which participatory rural appraisal (PRA) and rapid rural appraisal (RRA) tools were used. The quantitative data were analyzed by use value (UV), informant consensus factor (ICF), Fidelity Level (FL), and Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC).Results: A total of 108 weed species were recorded under 44 families as medicinal to treat different ailments. Among them, 79 species were dicotyledons, 25 monocotyledons (19 grasses and 6 sedges species) and 4 pteridophytes. The composition of species to their respective families showed the highest (12%) occurrence by families Poaceae and Asteraceae with first rank and the lowest (1%) occurrence by families Alismataceae and Typhaceae with sixth rank category. Weed species were being used as similar to other plant species used for ethnobotany, however the use as ethnomedicinal was remarkable. The medicinal use of weeds with the highest Informant Consensus Factor (ICF) (0.75) was for fever and in palpitation of heart and the lowest ICF (0.45) for paralysis and arthritis. The Use Value (UV) and Relative Frequency of Citation (RFC) were used to demonstrate that which weeds could be further used for pharmacological study and advancement of drug discovery. Conclusions: The finding proved the significance of weeds as medicine so there is a dire need to create awareness among the people for conservation and sustainable use of these weeds. Although weeds are undesirable plants, but they have high medicinal values, thus their controlled cultivation might be necessary as extensive cultivation may have bad impact on normal crops. The information of weed species and their use to treat various ailments must be explored, preserved, documented, and transferred from generation to generation.Keywords: Ethnomedicine, Indigenous knowledge, Kanchanpur, Nepal, Weeds.

3139596206	The tumor microenvironment plays a crucial role in cancer progression. In breast cancer, the extracellular matrix (ECM) is especially important as it contributes to mammographic breast density. Women with higher mammographic breast densities are at a greater risk for the development of breast cancer. Despite this, much knowledge of the ECM’s effects on breast cancer progression remains elusive. To better understand how ECM signaling affects breast cancer, we utilize fibroblast-deposited, decellularized ECM scaffolds. Scaffolds are produced for in vitro use by culturing a confluent layer of fibroblast cells over six days followed by decellularization with a detergent solution. RNA sequencing analysis of MCF7 human breast cancer cells cultured on ECM scaffolds versus uncoated dishes revealed differential expression of hundreds of genes. Most notably, genes within hallmark sets for early and late responses to estrogen were significantly enriched when cells were cultured on ECM. We confirm the expression of estrogen-responsive genes in breast cancer cells cultured on ECM even in the complete absence of estrogen, and also note that the estrogen receptor (ER) itself is downregulated at both the RNA and protein-level, consistent with results of estrogen stimulation. Treatment of breast cancer cells with ER inhibitors hydroxytamoxifen and fulvestrant reduces ECM-induced expression of estrogen-responsive genes. Likewise, culturing breast cancer cells on ECM enhances phosphorylation of Erk. Inhibition of phospho-Erk also reduces the expression of the same estrogen-responsive genes in cells cultured on ECM. Through luciferase, conditioned media, and estrogen-starvation assays, we demonstrate that ECM signaling activates estrogen receptor signaling in an estrogen-independent, nonclassical mechanism. In addition, we show that ER positive cells cultured on ECM are more resistant to ER-targeted therapeutics, but not other chemotherapeutic agents like paclitaxel or doxorubicin. Ultimately, we describe a pathway in which ECM can induce estrogen-independent activation of the ER as well as resistance to estrogen-targeted therapies in breast cancer. Clinical research into the effects of mammographic breast density beyond breast cancer predisposition is sparse, and this work provides incentive for investigators to better understand the relationship between breast fibrosis and clinical outcome.

3139596856	The identification of an ideal cell source for tissue regeneration remains a challenge in the stem cell field. The ability of progeny cells to differentiate into other cell types is important for the processes of tissue reconstruction and tissue engineering and has clinical, biochemical or molecular implications. The adaptation of stem cells from adipose tissue for use in regenerative medicine has created a new role for adipocytes. Mature adipocytes can easily be isolated from adipose cell suspensions and allowed to dedifferentiate into lipidfree multipotent cells, referred to as dedifferentiated fat(DFAT) cells. Compared to other adult stem cells, the DFAT cells have unique advantages in their abundance, ease of isolation and homogeneity. Under proper condition in vitro and in vivo, the DFAT cells have exhibited adipogenic, osteogenic, chondrogenic, cardiomyogenc, angiogenic, myogenic, and neurogenic potentials. In this review, we first discuss the phenomena of dedifferentiation and transdifferentiation of cells, and then dedifferentiation of adipocytes in particular. Understanding the dedifferentiation process itself may contribute to our knowledge of normal growth processes, as well as mechanisms of disease. Second, we highlight new developments in DFAT cell culture and summarize the current understanding of DFAT cell properties. The unique features of DFAT cells are promising for clinical applications such as tissue regeneration.

3139598887	Whether proliferative and quiescent intestinal stem cells coexist in normal and cancerous tissue is controversial. Due to heightened transcript expression in the intestinal epithelial stem cell compartment and detection in quiescent hair follicle stem cells, we hypothesized that Leucine-rich repeats and immunoglobulin-like domain protein 1 (Lrig1) would mark a novel population of intestinal stem cells and may be important for intestinal homeostasis and in cancer. To this end, we generated Lrig1-CreERT2/+; R26R-LacZ mice for Lrig1 intestinal epithelial cell lineage analysis. Examining adult mice at baseline and after irradiation damage, we show that Lrig1 labels both quiescent and proliferative stem cells and these cells are distinct from the well-defined Lgr5-expressing proliferative stem cell population. In addition, in a regenerative response to gut injury, these singly-labeled Lrig1-expressing cells proliferated and gave rise to clusters of labeled daughter cells, demonstrating the ability of these quiescent stem cells to become activated. Interestingly, loss of Lrig1 resulted in heightened expression of ErbB1-3 in the normal intestine, duodenal adenomas and carcinoma, supporting a role for Lrig1 in the maintenance of intestinal epithelial homeostasis and its ability to act as a tumor suppressor. To directly compare the role of the Lrig1and Lgr5expressing cell populations in tumorigenesis, we used both Lrig1-CreERT2/+;Apcfl/fl and Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2;Apcfl/fl mice to delete Apc. Five days after deletion, Lrig1CreERT2/+;Apcfl/fl mice have increased duodenal size and marked histological changes, which are absent in the Lgr5-EGFP-IRES-CreERT2;Apcfl/fl mice, further supporting a distinct and important role for the Lrig1 population in maintaining intestinal homeostasis. Finally, stochastic loss of Apc in Lrig1-expressing cells in Lrig1-CreERT2/+;Apcfl/+ mice results in multiple, large distal colonic tumors and less frequent, smaller intestinal tumorscommon features of human familial polyposis4.5 months after Cre activation. In summary, we show that Lrig1 is a distinct marker of both proliferative and quiescent intestinal stem cells, is important for intestinal homeostasis and acts as a tumor suppressor.
3139599732	In this study,four strains of Toxoplasma gondii with the same genetic type(Type I) originated from chicken,human,cat and swine were used to compare the immune responses in resistant chicken host to investigate the relationships between the parasite origins and the pathogenicity in certain host.A total of 300,10-day-old chickens were allocated randomly into five groups which named JS(from chicken),CAT(from cat),CN(from swine),RH(from human) and a negative control group(—Ve) with 60 birds in each group.Tachyzoites of four different T.gondii strains(JS,CAT,CN and RH) were inoculated intraperitoneally with the dose of 1×10~7 in the four designed groups,respectively.The negative control(-Ve) group was mockly inoculated with phosphate-buffered saline(PBS) alone.Blood and spleen samples were obtained on the day of inoculation(day 0) and at days 4,11,25,39 and 53 post-infection to screen the immunopathological changes.The results demonstrated some different immune characters of T.gondii infected chickens with that of mice or swine previous reported.These differences included up-regulation of major histocompatibility complex class Ⅱ(MHC Ⅱ) molecules in the early stage of infection,early peak expressions of interleukin(IL)-12(IL-12) and-10(IL-10) and long keep of IL-17.These might partially contribute to the resistance of chicken to T.gondii infection.Comparisons to chickens infected with strains from human,cat and swine,chickens infected with strain from chicken showed significant high levels of CD4~+ and CD8~+ T cells,interferon gamma(IFN-γ),IL-12 and IL-10.It suggested that the strain from chicken had different ability to stimulate cellular immunity in chicken.

3139600006	In order to investigate the effects of fasting (overnight and 48 hours) and insulin on expression of uncoupling protein(UCP)1,2 and 3 genes,UCP1,2 and 3 mRNA levels were observed by reverse transcription\|polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) assay in interscapular brown adipose tissue (BAT),periepididymal white adipose tissue (WAT) and gastrocnemius of rats.UCP 1 gene was expressed exclusively in BAT.UCP2 and 3 genes were expressed in these three types of tissues whereas mRNA levels of UCP2 and UCP3 were rich in WAT and in skeletal muscle respectively.UCP 1 and UCP 3 mRNA levels were decreased ( P 0 01) in BAT but UCP 2 mRNA level was increased in three types of tissues by overnight fasting.UCP3 gene expression was not influenced in WAT and skeletal muscle by fasting.Prolonging fasting time to 48 hours,UCPs mRNA levels in all tissues were upregulated to the same as or over control group except UCP2,3 mRNA levels that were decreased in BAT.Insulin upregulated UCPs gene expression in BAT,WAT and skeletal muscle ( P 0 05).UCPs gene expression of rats showed tissue specificity.The different expression of UCPs gene induced by fasting fime suggests that the function of subtypes of UCPs may play different roles in energy metabolism regulation.These results have also provided basis for further understanding of the relationship between diet\|thermogensis and body weight regulation,and the association with disease and body weight\|metabolism equilibrium.
3139600129	Biolog,16S rRNA gene denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis(DGGE) ,and phospholipid fatty acid(PLFA) analyses were used to assess soil microbial community characteristics in a chronosequence of tea garden systems(8-,50-,and 90-year-old tea gardens) ,an adjacent wasteland,and a 90-year-old forest. Biolog analysis showed that the average well color development(AWCD) of all carbon sources and the functional diversity based on the Shannon index decreased(P 0.05) in the following order:wasteland forest tea garden. For the DGGE analysis,the genetic diversity based on the Shannon index was significantly lower in the tea garden soils than in the wasteland. However,compared to the 90-year-old forest,the tea garden soils showed significantly higher genetic diversity. PLFA analysis showed that the ratio of Gram positive bacteria to Gram negative bacteria was significantly higher in the tea garden soils than in the wasteland,and the highest value was found in the 90-year-old forest. Both the fungal PLFA and the ratio of fungi to bacteria were significantly higher in the three tea garden soils than in the wasteland and forest,indicating that fungal PLFA was significantly affected by land-use change. Based on cluster analysis of the soil microbial community structure,all three analytical methods showed that land-use change had a greater effect on soil microbial community structure than tea garden age.

3139600529	A field experiment was conducted in Jurong of Nanjing, Jiangsu Province, China from 2006 to 2008 to investigate N2O emission during the wheat-growing season as affected by various rice straw returning methods prior to wheat cultivation. The study was designed to have four treatments: no rice straw applied (CK), rice straw burnt in situ (RB), rice straw evenly incorporated into the topsoil (RI), rice straw evenly spread over the field as mulch (RM). Results showed that N2O emission was decreased by 24-29% in Treatment RB and by 3-18% in Treatment RI, but increased by 15-39% in Treatment RM, compared with that in Treatment CK. The contents of soil total C and N at wheat harvest were significantly increased by 7-13% and by 8-12% in Treatment RI, respectively, compared with that in Treatment CK. The wheat grain yield in Treatment RI was 1.0-1.2 times that in the Treatment CK. Based on these results, the best management practice of returning rice straw to the soil prior to wheat cultiva- tion is evenly incorporating rice straw into the topsoil, as the method tended to reduce N2O emission during the wheat-growing season and increase wheat yield and soil fertility.

3139601391	Plants can be severely affected by insect herbivores and phytopathogenic fungi, but interactions between these plant antagonists are poorly understood. We analysed the impact of feeding damage by the abundant herbivore Orchestes fagi on infection rates of beech (Fagus sylvatica) leaves with Petrakia liobae, an invasive plant pathogenic fungus. The fungus was not detected in hibernating beetles, indicating that O. fagi does not serve as vector for P. liobae, at least not between growing seasons. Abundance of the fungus in beech leaves increased with feeding damage of the beetle and this relationship was stronger for sun-exposed than for shaded leaves. A laboratory experiment revealed sun-exposed leaves to have thicker cell walls and to be more resistant to pathogen infection than shaded leaves. Mechanical damage significantly increased frequency and size of necroses in the sun, but not in shade leaves. Our findings indicate that feeding damage of adult beetles provides entry ports for fungal colonization by removal of physical barriers and thus promotes infection success by pathogenic fungi. Feeding activity by larvae probably provides additional nutrient sources or eases access to substrates for the necrotrophic fungus. Our study exemplifies that invasive pathogens may benefit from herbivore activity, which may challenge forest health in light of climate change.

3139602037	Background: Anti-tumor vaccines targeting the entire tumor antigen repertoire represent an attractive immunotherapeutic approach. In the context of a phase I/II clinical trial, we vaccinated metastatic melanoma patients with autologous amplified tumor mRNA. In order to provide the large quantities of mRNA needed for each patient, the Stratagene CreatorTM SMARTTM cDNA library construction method was modified and applied to produce libraries derived from the tumors of 15 patients. The quality of those mRNA library vaccines was evaluated through sequencing and microarray analysis. Results: Random analysis of bacterial clones of the library showed a rate of 95% of recombinant plasmids among which a minimum of 51% of the clones contained a full-Open Reading Frame. In addition, despite a biased amplification toward small abundant transcripts compared to large rare fragments, we could document a relatively conserved gene expression profile between the total RNA of the tumor of origin and the corresponding in vitro transcribed complementary RNA (cRNA). Finally, listing the 30 most abundant transcripts of patient MEL02's library, a large number of tumor associated antigens (TAAs) either patient specific or shared by several melanomas were found. Conclusion: Our results show that unlimited amounts of cRNA representing tumor's transcriptome could be obtained and that this cRNA was a reliable source of a large variety of tumor antigens.

3139602429	Objective By measuring the ratio of mtDNA deletion of brain tissue, the relationship between mtDNA deletion and brain aging would be found in order to explain the molecular mechanism of aging. Method The mtDNA of the cerebral cortex, hippocampus and cerebellum of ten young (3 months) and seventeen aged (24 months) SD rats were isolated by alkaline extraction. The ratio of mtDNA deletion was measured by serial dilution PCR. Result The 4 834 bp deletion in mtDNA was found in the brain tissue of young and aged rats. The ratios of deleted mtDNA were similar in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, cerebellum of young rats (0 000 156%,0 000 148%,0 000 152%). The ratios of aged rats increased by 9,10 and 6 5 fold in the three brain regions over young rats. Conclusions mtDNA deletion also accumulated in the aged rat brain. It suggests that the accumulation of deleted mtDNA may be one of important factors of neuronal degeneration with aging.
3139602457	The present invention discloses a feed for broiler chicks and belongs to the technical field of poultry feeds.

The feed can obviously enhance the body immunity and disease resistance of laying chickens, reduce the death and culling rate and the broken and soft egg rate of the laying chickens, improve egg production rate, and increase egg weight. An added flavoring agent also further improves the taste of the feed and enhances the demands of the chickens for the feed, so the growth and development of the chickens are accelerated.
3139602679	The frog Xenopus laevis is a model species for developmental biology but is also of significant interest to comparative immunologists. Amphibians are the oldest group of organisms in which both the B lymphocytes of some species undergo immunoglobulin (Ig) class switch recombination and also have a dedicated mucosal Ig isotype. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that frog IgX would be produced in response to oral immunization. In order to facilitate studies of humoral, and especially mucosal immunity, in this model species, we developed a gavage technique for oral immunization. The result of this oral administration of antigen to frogs was assayed by the induction of the mucosal antibody isotype, IgX, in plasma by enzyme linked immunosorbant assay (ELISA), and a significant volution IgX upregulation was detected compared to frogs receiving systemic immunization into the coelom. These data are consistent with the view that IgX is the functional analog of mammalian IgA and mandate further studies of the relationship between IgX and IgA. Additionally, the gavage technique should be adaptable for functional studies of gut-associated immunology in other small aquatic vertebrates.
3139602689	Summary. Using a highly sensitive allele-specific PCR amplification method, we have previously shown that maternal cells could be detected in all 10 cord bloods tested. This raised the question of whether maternal cells are released into cord blood during the process of delivery or whether they are already present during pregnancy. We have now used the same PCR method to detect the presence of maternal cells in nine fetal blood samples collected at different gestational ages. Maternal cells were detected in eight samples obtained between 24 and 35 weeks of gestation. They were estimated to amount between 10 π4 and 10 π5 of nucleated fetal blood cells. In two cases mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell fractions were separated by Ficoll gradient centrifugation and maternal cells were detected as comparable levels in both fractions. Maternal cells could not be detected in the one fetal blood sample obtained at 20 weeks of gestation, suggesting that maternal cells could appear at detectable levels in fetal blood during the third trimester of pregnancy. These results are discussed in terms of materno-fetal immune tolerance and of transmission of viruses (and more specifically of the human immunodeficiency virus) from mother to child.
3139603230	Background: New technologies open a wide field of alternatives to improve the reproductive efficiency of cattle systems in artificial insemination, but they will only be successful to the extent that a precise organization and evaluation of the entire process is achieved.Objective: To make a summary of the main concepts, trends and perspectives, in relation to the reproductive efficiency of cattle systems in artificial insemination.Development: There are different criteria to define reproductive efficiency, an analysis of this aspect and the complexity of its evaluation in practice is carried out due to the differences between production systems and their established goals, which are more evident between production systems. annual and seasonal calving. A new concept of reproductive efficiency is defined applicable to any system.Conclusions: A definition of reproductive efficiency is provided based on the fertility of the parents, profitability, the intervention of man and the action of the environment. The seasonality associated with fixed-time artificial insemination (IATF) and the control of reproduction through the methodology of the global index of bioreproductive efficiency (IgEBR) are valued as zootechnical alternatives.Keywords: reproductive behavior, livestock, control of reproduction, seasonal reproduction (Source: AIMS)

3139603966	【Objective】Antifeedant activities of podophyllotoxin and 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin against the adult of stried leaf beetles Phyllotreta striolata were studied. 【Method】Podophyllotoxin and 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin were extracted and separated from Chinese umbrellaleaf rhizome. The antifeedant activities of podophyllotoxin and 4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin against P. striolata were made at 500,1 000,2 000,3 000 and 4 000 μg·mL- 1 concentrations for 24 h and 48 h respectively.【Result and conclusion】Podophyllotoxin showed a selective antifeedant effect,and the activities remained unchanged as time extended. By contrast,4'-demethylpodophyllotoxin had no obvious influence on antifeedant activities except under high concentration( 4 000 μg·mL- 1). The indexes of 4'-methyl were speculated to be the key functional group to affect the antifeedant activities according to the molecular structures of podophyllotoxin and 4'-hydroxypodophyllotoxin.
2055220388	The eastern tiger swallowtail butterfly,Papilio glaucus, is the most polyphagous of all Papilionidae species. While diverse larval detoxication abilities are known for bothPapilio glaucus and the closely relatedP. canadensis, the factors affecting oviposition preferences in adult females are unknown. These congeneric species were studied to determine the extent of oviposition mistakes on toxic plants. We were also interested in comparing the geographic patterns of variation in oviposition preferences and the genetic basis of these differences. We conducted oviposition three-choice studies with the Canadian tiger swallowtail butterfly,Papilio canadensis, and the Eastern tiger swallowtail,Papilio glaucus, giving them the choice of (1) tuliptree,Liriodendron tulipifera, which is toxic to virtually all populations (P. canadensis) north of the Great Lakes Region of North America, (2) quaking aspen,Populus tremuloides, which is toxic to essentially all populations (P. glaucus) south of the Great Lakes, and (3) black cherry,Prunus serotina, which is an excellent foodplant for all members of thePapilio glaucus group, but which does not occur at latitudinal extremes of North America (in Alaska and most of Canada or the southern half of Florida). Handpaired interspecific hybrids were tested under the same experimental design to evaluate the possibility of sexlinked oviposition behavior. There was considerable variability in the choice of plants by individual butterflies, but a general trend suggesting that the females of each species had a lower preference for the plant toxic to their larvae. More than 6000 oviposition bouts were counted from 37 differentp. canadensis and 54p. glaucus females along a latitudinal transect of approximately 5000 km from Alaska south through the Great Lakes hybrid zone region to southern Florida. While not exceptionally high anywhere, the preference for aspen (Salicaceae) declined precipitously in central Michigan (45° N latitude) and remained very low (5–12%) in all locations southward to Florida, whereas we observed a reciprocal trend in preference for tuliptree (Magnoliaceae) which was greatest in Florida (87% of all eggs) and steadily declined northward across the Great Lakes region. Cherry was selected in these 3-choice tests at a relatively consistent and low frequency at all latitudes. Fixed allele differences in sex-linked (LDH and PGD) and autosomal (HK) electromorphs are known forP. glaucus andP. canadensis. Our electrophoretic data suggest that the preference of an individual female for aspen is not simply a characteristic of the northern species (P. canadensis) but can occur inP. glaucus females. The reciprocal situation is also evident in Northern Michigan and Wisconsin females (scored electrophoretically and morphologically asP. canadensis) which sometimes exhibit a clear preference for the toxic tuliptree. In fact, Alaskan populations ofP. canadensis chose tuliptree for about 52% of their eggs, even though none of their offspring has ever survived on this plant species in laboratory studies. We conclude that even with distinctive latitudinal trends, a considerable amount of local variation in relative oviposition preference exists among individuals of these polyphagous species. BothP. glaucus andP. canadensis will lay eggs on toxic plants. It appears that factors selecting against oviposition on toxic tuliptrees have been minimal (relative to other factors) in Alaska and somewhat stronger in the Great Lakes hybrid zone. It is in this zone of contact with tuliptree where selection against theP. canadensis populations ovipositing on tuliptree may be strong due to high larval mortality when such natural “mistakes” are made. We do not know whether behavioral preference changes evolutionarily preceded or followed the development of specific physiological detoxication abilities for tuliptree or quaking aspen. However, for bothP. canadensis andP. glaucus the occurrence of “oviposition mistakes” on toxic plants by adults extends geographically well beyond the larval detoxication abilities of their offspring. Hybrid female offspring of pairings with Michigancanadensis females andglaucus males show distinct preferences for tuliptree, suggesting that oviposition may be controlled by a factor (or factors) on the sex chromosome. Unfortunately we were unable to obtain reciprocal hybrids to evaluate the possibility of sex-linked aspen preference.

2055220494	Protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs) play important roles in both normal physiology and human diseases. Deregulation of PRMT activity has been linked to several pathological states such as cancer and cardiovascular disorders. Herein, we report our work of designing and using new fluorescent reporters to perform single-step analysis of substrate binding and methylation by PRMT1. Both fluorescence intensity and anisotropy of the two reporters, R4-FL and H4-FL, were shown to effectively manifest enzyme-substrate interactions, highlighting their application in investigating PRMT inhibitors. In particular, the methylation process of R4-FL can be directly studied using fluorescence intensity readout. By combining the fluorescent measurement with radioactive analysis, we determined that AMI-1 inhibits PRMT1 activity through the mechanism of blocking peptide substrate binding.
2055220499	The effects of 3-week exercise training on the functions of peritoneal macrophages from BALB/c mice were investigated. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages from trained mice was markedly higher than those from control mice. Meanwhile, exercise training decreased the steady state level of beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) mRNA in macrophages. Overexpression of beta(2)AR in the macrophage cell line RAW264 by transfecting with beta(2)AR cDNA suppressed NO synthase (NOS) II expression but dose not influenced proinflammatory cytokine expression. When expression of transfected beta(2)AR in RAWar cells was downregulated by a tetracycline repressor-regulated mammalian expression system, NOS II mRNA expression was significantly increased; this suggested that the changes in the beta(2)AR expression level in macrophages associated with exercise training play a role in the regulation of NO production following LPS stimulation. These findings indicate that exercise training improves macrophage innate immune function in a beta(2)AR-dependent and -independent manner.
2055220501	In this report, we examine the hypothesis that the drivers of latitudinal selection observed in the eastern US Drosophila melanogaster populations are reiterated within seasons in a temperate orchard population in Pennsylvania, USA. Specifically, we ask whether alleles that are apparently favoured in northern populations are also favoured early in the spring, and decrease in frequency from the spring to autumn with the population expansion. We use SNP data collected for 46 metabolic genes and 128 SNPs representing the central metabolic pathway and examine for the aggregate SNP allele frequencies whether the association of allele change with latitude and that with increasing days of spring–autumn season are reversed. Testing by random permutation, we observe a highly significant negative correlation between these associations that is consistent with this expectation. This correlation is stronger when we confine our analysis to only those alleles that show significant latitudinal changes. This pattern is not caused by association with chromosomal inversions. When data are resampled using SNPs for amino acid change the relationship is not significant but is supported when SNPs associated with cis-expression are only considered. Our results suggest that climate factors driving latitudinal molecular variation in a metabolic pathway are related to those operating on a seasonal level within populations.
2055220530	Downy mildew, caused by Plasmapora viticola, is one of the endemic cryptogamic diseases of northern Spain that most commonly affects grapevines. Indeed, it is one of the diseases best known to viticulturalists worldwide. When climatic conditions are favourable, it attacks all organs of the plant, causing very serious crop losses and affecting the profitability and cost of wine. Given the climatic conditions of northern Spain, downy mildew attacks occur every year without exception, obliging growers to apply several treatments during the vine growth cycle. This not only increases cultivation costs enormously but causes environmental pollution and leads to problems during the fermentation of the must. Although the economic losses caused by downy mildew can be severe, greater knowledge of the pathogen’s biology, the availability of systemic treatments, and the better training of growers have helped reduce the risk of such damage. In recent years, several integrated programmes have been launched in the fight against this disease. Taking into account climatic conditions, the point in the vine growth cycle, and the development of the fungus, the aim is to reduce the number of treatments that need be applied to a minimum. Wine-producing countries are trying to develop disease prediction models for each of their growing regions. The German “Pro” [6] & “Freiburg” [8] models, and the Swiss “Winemild” model [1] are among the most well known. Infection with Plasmapora viticola leads to different symptoms depending on the organs attacked and the stage of its development: young leaves, adult leaves, or flowering stage, veraison, or ripening. Although the leaves can be affected even when very small, maximum sensitivity occurs when they are about 3 cm in diameter. The first symptoms are seen on the leaf lamina as ‘oil spots’. In the last phases of leaf disease, these spots become reddish-brown and acquire a typical mosaic pattern. Leaves become less sensitive as they age [3]. Vitis vinifera L. is very sensitive to downy mildew [4, 5, 10], although there are differences between different varieties and possibly even between different clones [10] . Many authors [4, 10, 7, 11] have reported that several factors appear to determine the degree of resistance possessed. Several laboratory studies [12] have investigated the resistance of different varieties of vine to downy mildew, but such results cannot always be extrapolated to the field. Different climatic, soil and cultivation conditions, etc., can all have great influence on whether the disease will appear and how it will develop. The qualitative methods currently used to measure resistance to disease have the problem of inherent subjectivity [5, 12]. A method is therefore required that can quantify the resistance of different varieties and clones in the field, which takes into account the factors that affect both plant and pathogen development, and which reduces as much as possible the subjectivity of current methods.
2055220539	Salamanders like newt and axolotl possess the ability to regenerate many of its lost body parts such as limbs, the tail with spinal cord, eye, brain, heart, the jaw 1. Specifically, newts are unique for its lens regeneration capability. Upon lens removal, IPE cells of the dorsal iris transdifferentiate to lens cells and eventually form a new lens in about a month 2,3. This property of regeneration is never exhibited by the ventral iris cells. The regeneration potential of the iris cells can be studied by making transplants of the in vitro cultured IPE cells. For the culture, the dorsal and ventral iris cells are first isolated from the eye and cultured separately for a time period of 2 weeks (Figure 1). These cultured cells are reaggregated and implanted back to the newt eye. Past studies have shown that the dorsal reaggregate maintains its lens forming capacity whereas the ventral aggregate does not form a lens, recapitulating, thus the in vivo process (Figure 2) 4,5. This system of determining regeneration potential of dorsal and ventral iris cells is very useful in studying the role of genes and proteins involved in lens regeneration.
2055220551	Disease-associated aberrant glycosylation may be protein specific and glycosylation site specific. Quantitative assessment of glycosylation changes at a site-specific molecular level may represent one of the initial steps for systematically revealing the glycosylation abnormalities associated with a disease or biological state. Comparative quantitative profiling of glycoproteome to provide accurate quantification of site-specific glycosylation occupancy has been a challenging task, requiring a concerted approach drawing from a variety of techniques. In this report, we present a quantitative glycoproteomics method that allows global scale identification and comparative quantification of glycosylation site occupancy using mass spectrometry. We further demonstrated this approach by quantitatively characterizing the N-glycoproteome of human pancreas.
2055220646	Bonus, a Drosophila TIF1 homolog, is a nuclear receptor cofactor required for viability, molting, and numerous morphological events. Here we establish a role for Bonus in the modulation of chromatin structure. We show that weak loss-of-function alleles of bonus have a more deleterious effect on males than on females. This male-enhanced lethality is not due to a defect in dosage compensation or somatic sex differentiation, but to the presence of the Y chromosome. Additionally, we show that bonus acts as both an enhancer and a suppressor of position-effect variegation. By immunostaining, we demonstrate that Bonus is associated with both interphase and prophase chromosomes and through chromatin immunoprecipitation show that two of these sites correspond to the histone gene cluster and the Stellate locus.
2055220670	The NMDAR subunit NR3A is most highly expressed during the second postnatal week, when synaptogenesis reaches peak levels. Genetic ablation or overexpression of the NR3A subunit negatively interferes with the maturation of cortical synapses and leads to changes in the shape and number of dendritic spines, the density of which is increased in NR3A knock-out mice and decreased in NR3A-overexpressing transgenic mice. Alterations in spine density have been linked to dysregulation of mTOR signaling and synaptic protein translation. Using a yeast two-hybrid system, we identified the mTOR-activating GTPase Rheb as an interacting protein of the NMDAR subunit NR3A. We confirmed the interaction in mammalian cells by expressing recombinant Rheb and NR3A and showed that Rheb and NR3A could be co-immunoprecipitated from synaptic plasma membranes from the developing rat brain. These data suggest that NR3A sequesters synaptic Rheb and might thus function as a break of the mTOR-dependent synaptic translation of protein.
2055220731	A survey was carried out from April 1998 to June 2000 to study the structure and the secondary production of the population of Heteromastus filiformis in the Loire estuary. Each month, samples were collected in the intertidal zone of Mindin harbour. The length of the thorax (L12) was correlated with the fresh weight (FW) with the relation FW=1.49848 L12-3.62804 (r=0.92). In 1999, the mean density was 2184 ind m -2 with a minimum of 1104 ind m -2 in December and a maximum of 3328 ind m -2 in March. The mean annual biomass was 15.4 g m -2 with a minimum of 2.6 g m -2 in December and a maximum of 28.2 g m -2 in March. Most of the histograms of size--frequency are unimodal and could be considered a single cohort except in May and November/ December 1999. The abundance and biomass of the population of H. filiformis decreased during summer and winter which are mortality periods and increase during spring and autumn which are recruitment periods for the population. The life time for a cohort was from six to nine months depending on the recruitment period and on the inter-annual variations. The secondary production was estimated by the method of Crisp (1971). The annual secondary production in 1999 was P=104.3 g m -2 with B=15.4 g m -2 and P:B=6.8. The quantity of sediment reworked by H. filiformis is about 1161 m -2 y -1 or 65 kg m -2 y -1 which is approximately a deep-sediment layer of 12 cm transported to the surface annually.
2055220745	Schizophrenia is a complex mental disorder with unknown aetiology. Both candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWA) studies suggest that the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system may play a part in development of the illness, but the causal HLA variant(s) remain(s) unclear. Previous studies showed that the DRB1*0101 and DRB1*13 alleles might be associated with a high risk of schizophrenia. Therefore, the present study was undertaken to test their association with the disease by genotyping seven DRB1-tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a British population. The results showed that, of the previously reported variants that were associated with schizophrenia, the DRB1*1303 allele was the only one marginally associated with a protective effect on the illness in our sample set (χ² = 4.138, P = 0.042, odds ratio (OR) = 0.42, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.27-0.66). Interestingly, a significant association was found for rs424232 (χ² = 9.404, P = 0.002, OR = 0.69, 95 % CI 0.54-0.88), which is a tag SNP for the DRB1*1303 allele and located near to the NOTCH4 gene that is a schizophrenia susceptibility locus confirmed by GWA studies. Analysis with the Haploview program demonstrated that rs424232 was in complete linkage disequilibrium with rs3130297 and rs3131296 present in the NOTCH4 locus. While we have failed to confirm association of the candidate alleles in the DRB1 gene with a high risk of schizophrenia, the present work suggests that the association signal detected in the HLA class II locus may extend a relatively long distance, and more work is needed in order to identify the true causal variants within this region or nearby.
2055220774	We have recently shown that the carbohydrate-binding pattern of galectins in cells differs from that determined in artificial (non-cellular) test-systems. To understand the observed discrepancy, we compared several test-systems differing in the mode of galectin presentation on solid phase. The most representative system was an assay where the binding of galectin (human galectins-1 and -3 were studied) to asialofetuin immobilized on solid phase was inhibited by polyacrylamide glycoconjugates, Glyc-PAA. This approach permits us to range quantitatively glycans (Glyc) by their affinity to galectin, i.e. to study both high and low affinity ligands. Our attempts to imitate the cell system by solid-phase assay were not successful. In the cell system galectin binds glycoconjugates by one carbohydrate-recognizing domain (CRD), and after that the binding to the remaining non-bound CRD is studied by means of fluorescein-labeled Glyc-PAA. In an “imitation” variant when galectins are loaded on adsorbed asialofetuin or Glyc-PAA followed by revealing of binding by the second Glyc-PAA, the interaction was not observed or glycans were ordered poorly, unlike in the inhibitory assay. When galectins were adsorbed on corresponding antibodies (when all CRDs were free for recognition by carbohydrate), a good concentration dependence was observed and patterns of specificities were similar (though not identical) for the two methods; notably, this system does not reflect the situation in the cell. Besides the above-mentioned, other variants of solid-phase analysis of galectin specificity were tested. The results elucidate the mechanism and consequence of galectin CRD cis-masking on cell surface.
2055220813	Summary  The present study describes the length–weight relationships (LWRs) of two important ornamental hill stream fishes, Barilius bendelisis and Barilius vagra (Hamilton), of northern India. A total of 630 specimens were collected from January to June 2011 in a spring-fed stream in Garhwal Himalaya, India. Information regarding LWRs of these species was not yet available in FishBase.
2055220901	Beta-catenin has been implicated in thymocyte development because of its function as a coactivator of Tcf/LEF-family transcription factors. Previously, we discovered a novel pathway for p53-induced beta-catenin degradation through a ubiquitin E3 ligase complex involving Siah1, SIP (CacyBP), Skp1, and Ebi. To gain insights into the physiological relevance of this new degradation pathway in vivo, we generated mutant mice lacking SIP. We demonstrate here that SIP-/- thymocytes have an impaired pre-TCR checkpoint with failure of TCRbeta gene rearrangement and increased apoptosis, resulting in reduced cellularity of the thymus. Moreover, the degradation of beta-catenin in response to DNA damage is significantly impaired in SIP-/- cells. SIP-/- embryonic fibroblasts show a growth-rate increase resulting from defects in G1 arrest. Thus, the beta-catenin degradation pathway mediated by SIP defines an essential checkpoint for thymocyte development and cell-cycle progression.
2055220904	The interrelationships among recent theories on the regulation of gene activity and differentiation in higher organisms are reviewed. Interpretations within these theories of the various components of chromosomes are re-evaluated and a unified conceptual framework of hierarchical genetic control mechanisms in eukaryotes is presented.
2055220943	The rat provides a number of important models of human genetic disease; however, the rat genetic map has not been extensively developed. Although most rat chromosomes carry several gene assignments, some major linkage groups (LG) remain to be mapped. To determine the chromosome location of the largest unmapped linkage group in the rat (LG V containing multiple carboxylesterase loci), we used single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis to identify the rat esterase-10 gene in a panel of rat x mouse somatic cell hybrids. We found that the carboxylesterase gene family and hence LG V are located on rat chromosome 19. We have also confirmed the assignment of the angiotensinogen gene to rat chromosome 19 and have used a large set of recombinant inbred strains to map two anonymous variable number of tandem repeat (VNTR) markers to this chromosome. The current findings bring the total number of genes assigned to rat chromosome 19 from 3 to 19 and provide further evidence of substantial homology between this chromosome and chromosome 8 in the mouse.
2055220950	Abstract Cultured arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC) can produce platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-like molecules. This property raises the possibility that SMC-derived PDGFs function as autocrine/paracrine regulators in the formation and maintenance of the artery wall. In this study we have asked if levels of mRNAs directing synthesis of PDGF are modulated in aortic SMC during postnatal development. We report here that genes encoding PDGF A- and B-chain precursors are expressed at similar low levels in intact aortas from newborn and adult rats. Marked differences in regulation of transcript abundance of these genes were revealed when aortic SMC were grown in cell culture. PDGF B-chain transcripts accumulated in passaged newborn rat SMC but not adult rat SMC, whereas PDGF A-chain RNA was found in comparable amounts in SMC from both age groups. Similarly, SMC from newborn rats secreted at least 60-fold more PDGF-like activity into conditioned medium than did adult rat SMC. PDGF B-chain transcripts in newborn rat aortic SMC are short-lived and increased 5-fold by 3 hr after treatment with cycloheximide. In contrast, PDGF A-chain transcripts are more stable, and their constitutive levels were generally unaffected by cycloheximide. These results show that PDGF A- and B-chain genes are transcribed in the normal rat aorta and provide evidence for age-related change in the control of PDGF B-chain gene expression in aortic SMC. Independent regulation of transcript levels in cultured SMC leaves open the possibility that PDGFs of different composition (AA, AB, BB) play different roles in normal function of the artery wall.

2055221036	Under laboratory conditions, the authors analyzed the survival rate of nymphs, the minimum and maximum duration of each stage, the length of life of the winged forms and oviposition of the females. Two groups of 100 eggs each were monitored. In batch A, the specimens were reared in a single glass receptacle. In batch B, the specimens were kept apart, one by one, and when they reached the winged stage, they formed twenty couples, which made it possible to watch over the oviposition of the females and the length of life of each specimen. The egg eclosion rate was 96%; the proportion still alive at the end of the nymph phase was 69. 5% in batch A and 78. 4% in batch B. The most frequent length of time observed between oviposition and eclosion of first-stage nymphs was 28 days. The nymph phase lasted four to eight months and the adult phase five months. The mean total oviposition in batch B was 181. 6 eggs per female.
2055221037	Abstract A biochemical role for SV40 small t antigen (t) in the viral infectious cycle that would explain the strong conservation of t structure among papovaviruses and its role as a helper of SV40 large T antigen function in the viral transforming process is not understood. Here, we report an intracellular biochemical function of the protein — the capacity to trans -activate selected RNA polymerase II and III-requireing promoters. Since t has failed in the past to bind to DNA and did not stimulate all polymerase II-requiring promoters tested, it likely trans -activates, at least in part, by modifying the activity of selected transcription factors.
2055221054	Abstract Two types of 47 kDa antigen specifically recognized by sera from rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients were isolated from the membrane fraction of a human chondrosarcoma-derived chondrocytic cell line (HCS-2/8) by a 2-step procedure: preparative SDS-PAGE and reverse-phase HPLC. An N-terminal amino acid sequence in one of the 47 kDa antigens, named RA-A47, had 81% homology to that deduced from the DNA sequence of thecolligingene which is reported as humanhsp47gene, and 100% homology to that deduced from the DNA sequence ofcolligin-2gene, a homologue ofcolligin.The RA-A47 cross-reacted with a monoclonal antibody raised against chick heat shock protein (Hsp) 47 and bound to gelatin. The expression of thera-a47gene was enhanced by heat shock treatment and TGF-β stimulation. These findings suggest that RA-A47 is a Hsp47-like protein, presumably the product of thecolligin-2gene, and that a collagen-specific molecular chaperone(s) such as Hsp47 and/or RA-A47 is involved in cartilage destruction in RA.
2055221127	The site (intra- vs. extraocular) of the circadian clock driving an ocular melatonin rhythm in Japanese quail was investigated by alternately covering the left and right eyes of individual quail, otherwise held in constant light (LL), for 12-hr periods. This procedure exposed each eye to a light-dark (LD) 12:12 light cycle 180 degrees (12 hr) out of phase with the LD 12:12 light cycle experienced by the other eye. This protocol entrained the melatonin rhythm in the left eye of quail 180 degrees out of phase with the rhythm expressed in the right eye. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that an independent light-entrainable circadian pacemaker resides in each eye; they are incompatible with the hypothesis that a single (or functionally single) extraocular pacemaker drives the ocular melatonin rhythm in both eyes. However, the results are also compatible with a model in which two independent extraocular circadian pacemakers, each with an exclusive photic input from one eye, drive the ocular melatonin rhythm.
2055221137	The present study describes the organization of the orexinergic (hypocretinergic) neurons in the hypothalamus of the giraffe and harbour porpoise – two members of the mammalian Order Cetartiodactyla which is comprised of the even-toed ungulates and the cetaceans as they share a monophyletic ancestry. Diencephalons from two sub-adult male giraffes and two adult male harbour porpoises were coronally sectioned and immunohistochemically stained for orexin-A. The staining revealed that the orexinergic neurons could be readily divided into two distinct neuronal types based on somal volume, area and length, these being the parvocellular and magnocellular orexin-A immunopositive (OxA+) groups. The magnocellular group could be further subdivided, on topological grounds, into three distinct clusters – a main cluster in the perifornical and lateral hypothalamus, a cluster associated with the zona incerta and a cluster associated with the optic tract. The parvocellular neurons were found in the medial hypothalamus, but could not be subdivided, rather they form a topologically amorphous cluster. The parvocellular cluster appears to be unique to the Cetartiodactyla as these neurons have not been described in other mammals to date, while the magnocellular nuclei appear to be homologous to similar nuclei described in other mammals. The overall size of both the parvocellular and magnocellular neurons (based on somal volume, area and length) were larger in the giraffe than the harbour porpoise, but the harbour porpoise had a higher number of both parvocellular and magnocellular orexinergic neurons than the giraffe despite both having a similar brain mass. The higher number of both parvocellular and magnocellular orexinergic neurons in the harbour porpoise may relate to the unusual sleep mechanisms in the cetaceans.
2055221164	The applicability of two immunodiagnostic techniques was studied for the detection of antibodies against schistosome gut-associated polysaccharide antigens in human schistosomiasis mansoni: the immunofluorescent antibody reaction (IFA) using Rossman's fixed paraffin sections of adult worms and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with a trichloroacetic acid soluble fraction of total adult worm antigens (AWA-TCA).
2055221216	The mature female and male spiders are described and figured from topotypical specimens of Gradungula woodwardi Forster, previously known only from immature females.
2055221223	Nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NAADP) is a potent Ca2+ mobilizing agent in a variety of broken and intact cell preparations. In sea urchin egg homogenates, NAADP releases Ca2+ independently of inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptor activation. Little, however, is known concerning the molecular target for NAADP. Here we report for the first time solubilization of NAADP receptors from sea urchin egg homogenates. Supernatant fractions, prepared following Triton X-100 treatment, bound [32P]NAADP with similar affinity and selectivity as membrane preparations. Furthermore, the unusual non-dissociating nature of NAADP binding to its receptor was preserved upon solubilization. NAADP receptors could also be released into supernatant fractions upon detergent treatment of membranes prelabeled with [32P]NAADP. Tagged receptors prepared in this way, were readily resolved by native gel electrophoresis as a single protein target. Gel filtration and sucrose density gradient centrifugation analysis indicates that NAADP receptors are substantially smaller than inositol trisphosphate or ryanodine receptors, providing further biochemical evidence that NAADP activates a novel intracellular Ca2+ release channel.
2055221296	A new technique using a single camera and shadows to determine 3-D spatial positions of fishes in the laboratory is described. The apparatus consisted of a large aquarium (2.0 x 1.5 x 0.4 m), a wide-angle camera mounted above and two light sources to cast shadows to either side of the fish. Using image analysis and vector mathematics, aquarium objects were plotted within 1.5 cm of their actual location along the x-, y- and z-axis. The technique was also successful in quantifying changes in 3-D spatial pattern of juvenile fish, Atlantic cod Gadus morhua (7.4-8.6 cm standard length, L S ) and cohabitant piscivorous shorthorned sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpinus (12.0-25.8 cm L S ), at these same viewing fields. The new technique should have a wide application, largely because it is potentially less expensive, laborious and invasive than alternative methods for determining 3-D positions of fishes.
2055221357	The recognition and differential diagnosis of pancreatic intraductal neoplasms (IN) have gained importance in the past few years, as the incidence of these tumors (especially intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms-IPMNs) have risen to >10% of pancreatic resections, and their significance as precursors of invasive cancer is better appreciated. Acinar cell carcinomas (ACCs) are typically solid tumors; however, we have recently encountered 7 ACCs with either intraductal growth and/or a papillary/papillocystic pattern that could be mistaken for IN. The clinicopathologic features of these cases were studied. Four patients were male and 3 female, with a mean age of 59 and mean tumor size of 4.9 cm (as compared with 10 cm in conventional ACCs). Only 1 patient had metastasis at the time of diagnosis (as opposed to 50% in usual ACCs). In 5 cases, the tumors had nodular growth of sheet-forming acinar cells, some of which were within ducts, as evidenced by the polypoid nature of the process, partial ductal lining, and presence of small tributary ducts in the walls. In 3 cases, the tumor had papillary and/or papillocystic growth, at least focally. All cases had cystic areas. No mucin was identified. All expressed trypsin. Markers of ductal differentiation were either absent or focal. A minor endocrine component was present in 3. The main histologic findings that distinguished these tumors from IPMNs were the more sheetlike nature of the nodules (rather than villous or arborizing papillae), cuboidal cells, overall basophilia of the cytoplasm, prominent nucleoli, apical granules, intraluminal crystals or pale, acidophilic secretions (enzymatic condensations), and lack of mucin. In conclusion, some ACCs show intraductal growth or exhibit papillary patterns, which can mimic IN, especially IPMNs. In such cases, attention to morphologic details described above, and immunohistochemistry are helpful. The clinical significance of this variant is difficult to determine; however, it appears that the tumors are relatively small and metastasis at presentation is less common than typically seen in ACCs (1/7 vs. 50%).
2055221420	Prophage-encoded genes can provide a variety of benefits for their bacterial hosts. These beneficial genes are often contained within “moron” elements. Morons, thus termed as the insertion of the DNA encoding them adds “more on” the genome in which they are found, are independent transcriptional units disseminated among phage genomes through horizontal gene transfer. Morons have been identified in the majority of phage genomes and they have been found to play diverse roles in bacterial physiology. At present, we are only beginning to ascribe functions to the many proteins encoded within these ubiquitous genetic elements. Recently, we discovered that the first described moron-encoded protein, gp15 of phage HK97, is expressed from the HK97 prophage and functions as a superinfection exclusion protein, protecting its host from genome injection by other phages. This work and the growing body of data pertaining to other morons challenges the traditional view of phages as purely parasites of bacteria and emphasizes the symbiotic relationship between bacteria and prophages.
2055221443	The esterase isozymes were surveyed in bacterized stocks representative of all 14 syngens of Paramecium aurelia by starch gel electrophoresis. The properties of substrate specificity and independent variation of particular isozymes permit the ordering of the differences observed among stocks. Differences can arise from several sources: bacterial variation, intrasyngenic variation, and intersyngenic variation. Bacterial esterases tend to be found in certain zonal areas (see Rowe et al., 1971) and produce minor stock differences, which are erratic in their distribution. Unlike the situation found in Tetrahymena pyriformis, major intrasyngenic variations are rare in P. aurelia except in syngen 2. This lack of intrasyngenic variation is significant in view of the wide differences in geographic origin and micronuclear chromosome numbers among stocks within a syngen. It suggests that certain esterase genotypes must be under stringent selection within a syngen. The lack of intrasyngenic variation permits assessment of intersyngenic relationships. Syngens differ in a complex way from each other, suggesting that several gene differences may be involved. The syngens can be classified on the basis of their esterases. Syngens which have been shown to be more closely related in terms of cross-mating, breeding systems, and other criteria tend to be more similar in their esterase isozymes. The isozyme technique confirms relationships previously suggested among syngens and offers the promise of eventual assessment of evolutionary distances among syngens. However, establishment of these relationships will be clearer in the absence of bacteria.
2055221516	Cultured embryonic cells from Rattus (Mastomys) natalensis were treated with the base analogues 5-bromodeoxyuridine and 2-aminopurine, the viruses herpes simplex virus and adenovirus type 12, and the carcinogens 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene and urethan. Treatment with these agents, except urethan, causes an increase in the incidence of chromosome aberrations. The induced aberrations are not randomly distributed among the chromosomes or within a chromosome. The X chromosome, especially its long arm, is more sensitive to these agents than is any other chromosomes in the complement. — A possible relationship among the high incidence of damage, the positive heteropycnosis, and the late replication in the X chromosome of R. natalensis is discussed.
2055221541	BACKGROUND  Prostatic androgen-repressed message-1 (PARM-1) has been cloned from the prostate. The transcript of the PARM-1 gene is overexpressed during regression of the prostate after androgen withdrawal. The regulation of PARM-1 by androgens is limited to this organ. We have studied the effects of PARM-1 overexpression in malignant prostate cells.    METHODS  The PARM-1 cDNA was introduced into the rat cancer cell line MAT LyLu along with a doxycycline-dependent regulator.    RESULTS  Maximal expression of PARM-1 (fivefold induction) was achieved by incubating the cells with 2 μM doxycycline for 48 hr. A study investigating the effect of PARM-1 overexpression on the transcription of 588 genes has shown that the TLP1 gene (encoding rat telomerase protein component 1) was the most up-regulated (fourfold). In addition, a dose-dependent increase in telomerase activity was observed in cells overexpressing PARM-1. In vivo, the androgen-deprived prostate showed an increased TLP1 level and increased telomerase activity.    CONCLUSIONS  Increased telomerase activity is often associated with the immortalisation of cancer cell lines, particularly prostatic ones. This could mean that PARM-1 is involved, via increased telomerase activity, in a survival program enabling certain prostatic cells to resist apoptosis, thus conferring a selective advantage to pre-cancerous or cancerous cells.

2055221558	Abstract The effects of prenatal nicotine exposure on development of catecholaminergic pathways were examined through measurements of transmitter turnover and levels in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Administration of nicotine (3 mg/kg SC, twice daily) to pregnant rats on gestational days 3 through 20 resulted in growth retardation which did not spare the brain and which did not resolve until after weaning. Nicotine exposure produced an elevation in transmitter turnover in central noradrenergic pathways with a regional selectivity reflecting the timetable of cellular development: the most profound effects were seen in late-developing regions (cerebellum), intermediate effects were found in earlier-developing areas (cerebral cortex) and the least effect was obtained where maturation occurs earliest (midbrain + brainstem). Dopaminergic pathways were much less vulnerable than was the noradrenergic system. Effects on the peripheral sympathetic nervous system also were targeted toward specific neuronal populations: renal, cardiac and adrenal pathways were activated by prenatal nicotine exposure, whereas sympathetic innervation of the lung showed reduced activity. All the peripheral effects appeared only after the second postnatal week. These results indicate that prenatal nicotine exposure produces profound alterations in transmitter disposition which are targeted toward specific neuronal populations and which may depend upon generalized effects on cellular development of specific brain regions. Because altered peripheral nerve activity was seen only after the onset of central control of sympathetic tone, actions on central regulation may play a role in the relatively more profound effects in the autonomie nervous system.
2055221595	Phenotypic differentiation of two tetraploid (2n = 4x = 36, 36+1B, 36+2B) populations of Santolina rosmarinifolia geographically isolated from diploid populations was investigated. The karyotype was relatively homogeneous, meiosis was regular and pollen was fertile in both cytotypes. An autopolyploid or allopolyploid origin for tetraploid cytotypes is discussed. Overall, 80.82% of all variance in achene weight, time t0, t50 and t90 of germination and accumulated germination rate was due to achene age at each ploidy level. Partition of the total phenotypic variance showed that there was extensive variation between ploidy levels. The mean of morphological characters was generally higher in polyploids. For diploid cytotypes, flower number, achene production and fruiting percentage were significantly higher than for tetraploid cytotypes. Cluster analysis indicated that the patterns of seedling morphology and development were similar in three diploid individuals and several tetraploids; the same analysis showed high similarity between diploid individuals of the natural populations, whereas tetraploid individuals showed high dissimilarity among themselves and with diploid individuals. Multiple correspondence analysis and logistic regression analysis indicated that qualitative characters contribute strongly to cytotype differentiation. The results support recognition of the tetraploid cytotypes at the subspecies level. © 2008 The Linnean Society of London, Botanical Journal of the Linnean Society, 2008, 158, 650–668.
2055221600	The purpose of this study was the appraisal of the clinical and functional consequences of germline mutations within the gene for the IL-2 inducible T-cell kinase, ITK. Among patients with Epstein-Barr virus-driven lymphoproliferative disorders (EBV-LPD), negative for mutations in SH2D1A and XIAP (n=46), we identified two patients with R29H or D500T,F501L,M503X mutations, respectively. Human wild-type (wt) ITK, but none of the mutants, was able to rescue defective calcium flux in murine Itk−/− T cells. Pulse-chase experiments showed that ITK mutations lead to varying reductions of protein half-life from 25 to 69% as compared with wt ITK (107 min). The pleckstrin homology domain of wt ITK binds most prominently to phosphatidylinositol monophosphates (PI(3)P, PI(4)P, PI(5)P) and to lesser extend to its double or triple phosphorylated derivates (PIP2, PIP3), interactions which were dramatically reduced in the patient with the ITKR29H mutant. ITK mutations are distributed over the entire protein and include missense, nonsense and indel mutations, reminiscent of the situation in its sister kinase in B cells, Bruton's tyrosine kinase.
2055221606	A spectrum of limb abnormalities ranging from adactyly, syndactyly, acrosyndactyly to nail hypoplasia was encountered in mouse embryos subjected to amniotic sac puncture at the corresponding gestational stage when human chorionic villus sampling (cvs) would normally be performed clinically. Previous skeletal studies revealed that, apart from the occasional incidence of fusion of 2 distal phalanges, syndactyly usually only affected the soft tissues within the interdigital spaces. A similar situation was also observed in cases of adactyly; while the skeletal elements of the digits were present, the soft tissues in the interdigital spaces failed to separate. A transient period of bradycardia is induced, possibly secondary to compression of the embryo by the extraembryonic membranes and uterine muscles following amniotic sac puncture. These factors, we believe, produce temporary hypoxia/ischaemia of the distal extremities, and may lead to the modification of the interdigital mesenchymal tissues within the autopods. In order to investigate the mechanism(s) underlying soft tissue syndactyly, limbs recovered at 0.5, 4, 8, 12, 24, or 36 h following amniotic sac puncture (ASP) were examined histologically. Vascular disruption in the form of localised areas of haemorrhage, vascular dilatation and congestion and the presence of fluid-filled cavities occurred in relation to the marginal vein and vascular plexus in the interdigital spaces. It is hypothesised that this interfered with the normal equilibrium of the preset programs of mitosis/cell death and apoptosis within the mesenchymal cells of the interdigital spaces. Apoptosis in these areas was inhibited in the majority of the experimental limbs analysed 4 h after ASP. Instead of undergoing necrosis/apoptosis, increased mitotic activity was usually observed from 8 h following ASP at the sites where apoptosis would normally be expected to be seen. The aberrant fate of the interdigital mesenchyme following ASP and the underlying mechanism(s) involved are discussed, as is the critical importance of an adequate vascular supply to the interdigital spaces during the morphogenesis of the autopod. We believe that this report contributes to understanding the mechanism(s) which lead to syndactyly following ASP, and the limb defects occasionally seen following cvs when this is undertaken during early gestation.
2055221631	SummaryThe shapes of the x-ray survival-curves of two tissue-cultured mammalian cell-lines have been studied, using machine methods for data fitting. It was found that the survival data fit a ‘multi-process’ cell-killing model better than the ‘single-process’ model proposed by other workers. In addition, the effects of the mode of plating and the time of irradiation were studied. Although both affect the sensitivity of the cells, no effect on the shapes of the survival-curves was demonstrated.
2055221633	Abstract The ulrastruclure of the lung provides a cytomorphologic basis for the identification of unusual pulmonary neoplasms or unusual histologic variants of more common pulmonary lesions. Comparison of tumor cells with bron-chioloalveolar lining cells and with pleural components has aided in the diagnosis of a spindle cell variant of a peripheral neuroendocrine cell tumor (carcinoid) and a tumor composed of cells resembling bronchioloalveolar epithelium (sclerosing hemangioma of lung).
2055221644	CIAPIN1, a newly identified apoptosis-related molecule, was found to be downregulated in human gastric cancer tissues as compared to the matched adjacent nonneoplastic tissues. In this study, we investigated the effect of CIAPIN1 on in vitro and in vivo proliferation of gastric cancer cells. Ectopic expression and knockdown of CIAPIN1 in gastric cancer cells SGC7901 and MKN45 were achieved by transduction with recombinant adenoviruses expressing human CIAPIN1 (Ad-CIAPIN1) and human CIAPIN1-specific small interference RNA (Ad-CIAPIN1 siRNA). Gastric cancer cells with upregulated expression of CIAPIN1 exhibited significantly decreased proliferation, while cellswith downregulated CIAPIN1 expression showed significantly quicker growth rate as compared with their respective controls in both in vitro and in vivo tests. Also, CIAPIN1suppressed colony formation of SGC7901 and MKN45 cells in soft agar cloning test.Furthermore, cell cycle distribution analysis revealed that CIAPIN1 induced cell cycle arrest at G1/S phase. Downregulation of CyclyinD1 and upregulation of P27 might contribute, at least in part, to this altered cell cycle distribution. This study demonstrates that CIAPIN1 is a suppressor of gastric cancer cell proliferation and suggests CIAPIN1might play an important role in the development of human gastric cancer.
2055221652	The effect of the organophosphorus insecticide Ekalux Ec-25 (quinalphos) was studied on akinete germination, and sporulation of the green algaPithophora kewensis (Cladophorales). Initiation of akinete germination was delayed by 1–3 d with 0.025–0.1% concentrations of the pesticide used. The percentage of akinete germination was found to be markedly affected by the treatment with insecticide, except with the concentration of 0.25% Ekalux Ec-25, where percent germination was observed to be higher than in the control. Generally, the time taken for the initiation of akinete formation increased and percent sporulation decreased with the increase of concentrations from 0.025 to 0.1% of Ekalux Ec-25.
2055221664	"Dioscorea natalia (Dioscoreaceae) is described from wet to very wet areas on both Pacific and Caribbean slopes of Costa Rica, from the Monteverde area to Tapantf National Park. The species' confusion with the related D. lepida C. V. Morton is discussed, and a key is provided to distinguish it from that species and the other two closely related Costa Rican species, D. racemosa (Klotzsch) Uline and D. standlyei C. V. Morton. During the course of work on a treatment of Dioscorea for the Manual de Plantas de Costa Rica, material of three possible new species was set aside for further study. Careful examination and review demonstrated that one of them would not be separated from the recently described Panamanian D. davidsei 0. Tllez, and that the other corresponds to D. lepida. The third, here described as D. natalia, had previously been identified as D. lepida and with that species, is closely related to two other Costa Rican species, D. racemosa and D. standleyi.

Distribution. This species, apparently endemic to Costa Rica, is known from some of the very wettest parts of the country, especially P. N. Tapantif. However, it is also known from the Las Nubes area of Monteverde, which is relatively dry. So far it is known only from 900-1500 m, from Monteverde and Tapantf, and several intervening localities. Etymology. It was my pleasure to defer to Silvia Troyo, illustrator of this new species, the honor of choosing its name. When she came across the species for the first time in the field, she was struck by the same joy of discovery as any taxonomist upon finding such a new species, so tiny and precious. For all good reason, she chose the name Natalia, one often given here to first-born daughters, and that of her own. The epithet ""natalia"" is used NovoN 10: 378-381. 2000.

2055221691	Abstract The tumor promoter 20- 3 H-phorbol 12,13-dibutyrate bound in a specific manner to particulate preparations from both whole mouse skin and mouse epidermis. The binding, which was comparable in both whole skin and epidermal preparations, occurred rapidly, was reversible upon addition of non-radioactive ligand and showed high affinity (K D = 2.4 × 10 −8 M). The potencies of phorbol esters for inhibiting binding of 3 H-PDBu corresponded to their biological and tumor-promoting activities: phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate, K I = 0.74 nM; phorbol 12,13-didecanoate, K I = 16 nM; phorbol 12,13-dibenzoate, K I = 82 nM; mezerein, K I = 98 nM; phorbol 12,13-diacetate, K I = 3 μM; phorbol 12,13,20-triacetate, K I = 5.6 μM; phorbol 13-acetate, K I = 64 μM. The biologically inactive derivatives phorbol (0.88 mM) and 4α-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (15 μM) did not inhibit binding. Likewise, 3 H-PDBu binding was only weakly inhibited by phorbol-related diterpenes which are highly inflammatory but nonpromoting. These structure-activity relationships suggest that the 3 H-PDBu binding activity mediates phorbol ester tumor promotion. 3 H-PDBu binding was not inhibited by the nonphorbol promoters examined. Similarly, it was not blocked by compounds which antagonize (dexamethasone acetate, 2 μM; retinoic acid, 10 μM) or mimic (epidermal growth factor, 100 ng/ml; melittin, 25 μg/ml; PGE 2 , 1 μM) some of the effects of the phorbol esters in vivo or in vitro.
2055221709	This study describes longitudinal changes in serum levels of biochemical markers of bone cell activity in a group of 24 thoroughbred foals from birth to 18 months of age. The markers of bone formation included the type I collagen carboxy-terminal propeptide (PICP), the bone-specific isoenzyme of alkaline phosphatase (BAP), and osteocalcin (OC). Levels of the cross-linked telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP), a marker of bone resorption, and the N-terminal propeptide of type III collagen (PNIIIP), a marker of soft tissue turnover, were also measured. Levels of all markers fell significantly between birth and 18 months of age (70-80 per cent); this decrease being most marked between 0 and 6 months. However, a transient increase in levels of the markers then occurred between 6 and 14 months of age. The timing of this increase was specific for each parameter. ICTP and OC concentrations increased between October and December. PICP concentrations increased between December and April whereas the increase in PIIINP was coincident with the peak in weight gain between April and June. Changes in BAP concentration were less distinct at this time. Season was shown to have significant effects on the biochemical markers independent from the effect of age. Concentrations of all markers decreased with increasing body weight and at any given age heavier horses had lower marker levels. These results show that biochemical markers of bone cell activity and soft tissue turnover follow characteristic patterns of change in growing thoroughbreds influenced by age, season and bodyweight. The demonstration that the reference ranges for the biochemical markers change from month to month means that single samples from individuals are of little value for monitoring bone cell activity in growing thoroughbreds.

2055221813	Seed coat phenolic compounds represent important antinutritive fibre components that cause a considerable reduction in value of seed meals from oilseed rape (Brassica napus). The nutritionally most important fibre compound is acid detergent lignin (ADL), to which a significant contribution is made by phenylpropanoid-derived lignin precursors. In this study, we used bulked-segregant analysis in a population of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from a cross of the Chinese oilseed rape lines GH06 (yellow seed, low ADL) and P174 (black seed, high ADL) to identify markers with tight linkage to a major quantitative trait locus (QTL) for seed ADL content. Fine mapping of the QTL was performed in a backcross population comprising 872 BC1F2 plants from a cross of an F7 RIL from the above-mentioned population, which was heterozygous for this major QTL and P174. A 3:1 phenotypic segregation for seed ADL content indicated that a single, dominant, major locus causes a substantial reduction in ADL. This locus was successively narrowed to 0.75 cM using in silico markers derived from a homologous Brassica rapa sequence contig spanning the QTL. Subsequently, we located a B. rapa orthologue of the key lignin biosynthesis gene CINNAMOYL CO-A REDUCTASE 1 (CCR1) only 600 kbp (0.75 cM) upstream of the nearest linked marker. Sequencing of PCR amplicons, covering the full-length coding sequences of Bna.CCR1 homologues, revealed a locus in P174 whose sequence corresponds to the Brassica oleracea wild-type allele from chromosome C8. In GH06, however, this allele is replaced by a homologue derived from chromosome A9 that contains a loss-of-function frameshift mutation in exon 1. Genetic and physical map data infer that this loss-of-function allele has replaced a functional Bna.CCR1 locus on chromosome C8 in GH06 by homoeologous non-reciprocal translocation.
2055221938	Abstract If appropriately applied, biological control offers one of the most promising, environmentally sound, and sustainable control tactics for arthropod pests and weeds for application as part of an integrated pest management (IPM) approach. Public support for biological control as one of the preferred methods of managing non-indigenous and indigenous pests is increasing in many countries. An FAO/IAEA Coordinated Research Project (CRP) addressed constraints related to costly production systems for biological control agents, and the presence of accompanying pest organisms during their shipment. These constraints can be alleviated using nuclear techniques such as ionizing radiation or X-rays to reduce production and handling costs (e.g., by expanding the period of host suitability, increasing shelf life, avoiding unnecessary sorting steps before shipment, etc.), and to eliminate the risk of shipping fertile host or prey pest individuals or other hitchhiking pests. These nuclear techniques can also help ...
2055221991	A factor produced by P388D, cell line murine macrophages showed a profound suppressive effect on the in vitro proliferation of B lineage cells. It was purified to homogeneity from conditioned media of P388D1 cells stimulated with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate for 48 h by a three-step procedure. The purified factor gave a single band of protein with a molecular mass of 16 kD on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. We show here that exposure of B lineage cells to this factor results in the induction of a cytotoxic effect and a significant increase in the proportion of fragmented DNA. DNA fragmentation was detected in B lineage cells after 3 h culture with the factor in the quantitative colorimetric determination. The mechanism of cell death was characterized by a ladder-like electrophoretic pattern of degraded chromosomal DNA, indicating that the factor induces apoptosis. The NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of this factor was identical with that of activin A over the 26 amino acid residues identified....
2055222014	De novo acute leukaemia presenting with a mixed lymphoid and myeloid leukaemic population has rarely been described. We have used the consensus Ig heavy chain primers and DNA isolated from these two distinct populations of cells in polymerase chain reactions. We demonstrated that both populations of cells exhibited Ig heavy chain gene rearrangements. Cloning and subsequent DNA sequencing of the amplified products showed a common V-D-J junctional nucleotide sequence. This work therefore provides the first evidence that the leukaemic cells in de novo acute leukaemia with a mixed lymphoid and myeloid population are derived from a common progenitor clone and may offer an explanation for the poor prognosis in these patients.
2055222024	Plants produce an array of proteins as a part of a global response to protect the cell metabolism when they grow under environmental conditions such as drought and salinity that generate reduced water potential. The synthesis of hydrophilic proteins is a major part of the response to water deficit conditions. An increased expression of LEA proteins is thought to be one of the primary lines of defense to prevent the loss of intercellular water during adverse conditions. These LEA proteins are known to prevent aggregation of a wide range of other proteins. In this study we report the water stress induced protein aggregation and its abrogation followed by expression of group 1 and group 2 LEA proteins of water soluble proteomes in horsegram. Water stress caused an increased protein aggregation with magnitude and duration of stress in horsegram seedlings. Tissue-specific expression of LEA 1 protein decreased in the embryonic axis when compared to cotyledons in 24 h stressed seedlings. We found no cross reaction of LEA 1 with proteome of 48 h stressed embryonic axis and 72 h stressed root and shoot samples. However, LEA 2 antibodies were cross reacted with four polypeptides with different molecular mass in shoot tissue samples and found no reaction with root proteome as evidenced from immuno-blot analysis. The role of LEA proteins in relation to protein aggregation during water stressed conditions was discussed.
2055222043	A new case of reciprocal translocation t(10; 13)(q 16;q21) was detected in a hybrid boar (Large White × Pietrain × Duroc × Hampshire) from an artificial insemination (AI) station. Altogether, 258 sires of 4 pure breeds as well as hybrid lines and crossbreeds were investigated. The diagnosis was based on classical cytogenetic examination following the standard protocols of lymphocyte cultures, Giemsa staining and G-, C- and Ag-I banding techniques. The population screening performed was an initial part of a long-term karyotype control system of boars kept at AI stations, which was started by the National Research Institute of Animal Production in Poland in 2007.
2055222102	Basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) are structurally related fibroblast growth factors, yet they exhibit distinct receptor binding specificity. Basic FGF binds with high affinity to FGFR1, FGFR2, and FGFR4, whereas KGF does not interact with these receptors and can only bind an isoform of FGFR2 known as the KGFR. Basic GFG binds KGFR but with lower affinity than KGF. In order to identify domains that confer this specificity, four reciprocal chimeras were generated between the two growth factors and were analyzed for receptor recognition and biological activity. The chimeras are designated BK1 (bFGF1-54:KGF91-194), BK2 (bFGF1-74:KGF111-194), KB1 (KGF31-90:bFGF55-155), and KB2 (KGF31-110:bFGF75-155). The two BK chimera similarly interacted with FGFR1 and FGFR4 but differed from each other with respect to KGFR recognition. BK1 displayed a slightly better affinity for KGFR than BK2 and induced a higher level of DNA synthesis in keratinocytes compared with bFGF and BK2. A neutralizing monoclonal antibody directed against bFGF specifically neutralized the biological activity of the BK chimeras. The reciprocal chimeras, KB1 and KB2, exhibited KGF-like receptor binding and activation properties. However, KB2 displayed higher affinity for KGFR and was significantly more potent mitogen that KB1. Altogether, our results suggest that the amino-terminal part of KGF and bFGF plays an important role in determining their receptor binding specificity. In addition, the results point to the contribution of a segment from the middle part of KGF (residues 91-110) for recognition and activation of the KGFR, as the two chimeras containing these residues (BK1 and KB2) displayed an enhanced interaction with the KGFR.
2055222129	One of the key goals of ecology is to explain the distri-bution and abundance of species. It has become apparent,however, that even to describe these matters is fraughtwith difﬁculty. The abundance or rarity of a species canbe described in many ways, ranging from global geograph-ical range through regional ubiquity and population struc-ture down to local population size or cover. These differentaspects of abundance can be thought of as different scalesof analysis and indeed can be reﬂected by mapping a pop-ulation at varying scales of resolution. There is, however,a fundamental asymmetry in such maps; a ﬁne-scale mapof a given area can be used to generate a coarse-scale map,but a coarse-scale map does not provide enough infor-mation to produce a ﬁne-scale map. This is unfortunate,as a considerable amount of coarse-scale informationabout species distributions is available in many countries(e.g., Perring and Walters 1962; Jalas and Suominen 1987),but management decisions in conservation biology andother applied disciplines often require ﬁne-scale (e.g., pop-ulation) data.Fortunately, the situation is not as bleak as it may seemat ﬁrst glance. Even if ﬁne-scale maps cannot be generatedfrom coarse ones, it may be possible to infer some of theimportant properties of the ﬁne-scale map from coarse-scale information. One of us (W. E. Kunin) recently dem-onstrated that some properties of a species distributionbehave in similar ways at different scales, making it pos-sible (at least in principle) to extrapolate coarse-scale in-formation down to ﬁner scales (Kunin 1998). “Scale-area
2055222144	Abstract We previously demonstrated in vitro that mammalian follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) stimulates the proliferation of newt secondary spermatogonia and their differentiation into primary spermatocytes. In the current study, we isolated a cDNA from newt testis that encodes a FSH receptor (FSH-R). The total sequence homology in the deduced protein of the newt was approximately 70% with mammalian FSH-Rs. Mammalian cells, transiently transfected with the cloned newt FSH-R cDNA, displayed specific binding to [125I] human FSH and cAMP accumulation, indicating that the cloned cDNA encodes a functional newt FSH-R protein. Northern blot analysis revealed a single transcript of approximately 3.0 kb length that was synthesized in testicular somatic cells (mainly Sertoli cells) from spermatogonial to spermatid stages with the highest level expressed during the primary spermatocytes stage. These results demonstrate that FSH stimulates newt spermatogenesis through the FSH-R. This study, as far as we know, reports for the first time the cloning of an amphibian FSH-R cDNA.
2055222153	Species of sandflies in the subgenuys Trichopygomyia of the genus Lutzomyia occurring in Venezuela are reviewd. A new species, Lutzomyia pinna n. sp. is described. A distribution map and a pictorial key for maleds are provided with remarks on the ecological data collected in Venezuela.
2055222179	Lysozyme is an ubiquitous enzyme found in most biological secretions and leukocytes. This study was aimed at investigating its interaction with other inflammatory mediators on mucosa surfaces, particularly the complement system. Lysozyme has been shown in our present study, to inhibit the haemolytic activity of serum complement in a dose-dependent fashion, when tested within the levels present in normal and inflamed breast-milk samples, and other mucosal secretions. This represents a new anti-inflammatory action of lysozyme in relation to the serum complement, and the exact mode of the interaction need further studies.
2055222236	Three anthraquinones (1, 2 and 4), three stilbenes (5, 6 and 7) and 3,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol (3) were isolated from Reynoutria japonica. Their structures were identified as emodin (1), emodin-8-O-β-d-glucoside (2), 3,5-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol (3), citreorosein (4), cis-resveratrol (5), trans-resveratrol (6) and trans-resveratrol-5-O-β-d-glucopyranoside (7) by comparing their physicochemical and spectral data with published data. Compound 3 was isolated for the first time from the Polygonaceae family. Among the purified compounds, 3 showed more potent inhibitory activity against topoisomerase I (IC50: 4 μM) than camptothecin, as the positive control (IC50: 18 μM). Compounds 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7 showed stronger inhibitory activities toward DNA topoisomerase II (IC50: 0.54, 14, 15, 0.77 and 3 μM, respectively) than the positive control, etoposide (IC50: 44 μM). Compounds 1 and 4 displayed weak cytotoxicities against human lung cancer (A549), ovarian cancer (SK-OV-3), human liver hepatoblastoma (HepG2) and colon adenocarcinoma (HT-29) cell lines.
2055222262	Numerous intestinal diseases are characterized by immune cell activation and compromised epithelial barrier function. We have shown that cytokine treatment of epithelial monolayers increases myosin II regulatory light chain (MLC) phosphorylation and decreases barrier function and that these are both reversed by MLC kinase (MLCK) inhibition. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanisms by which interferon (IFN)-γ and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α regulate MLC phosphorylation and disrupt epithelial barrier function. We developed a model in which both cytokines were required for barrier dysfunction. Barrier dysfunction was also induced by TNF-α addition to IFN-γ-primed, but not control, Caco-2 monolayers. TNF-α treatment of IFN-γ-primed monolayers caused increases in both MLCK expression and MLC phosphorylation, suggesting that MLCK is a TNF-α-inducible protein. These effects of TNF-α were not mediated by nuclear factor-κB. However, at doses below those needed for nuclear factor-κB inhibition, sulfasalazine was able to prevent TNF-α-induced barrier dysfunction, MLCK up-regulation, and MLC phosphorylation. Low-dose sulfasalazine also prevented morphologically evident tight junction disruption induced by TNF-α. These data show that IFN-γ can prime intestinal epithelial monolayers to respond to TNF-α by disrupting tight junction morphology and barrier function via MLCK up-regulation and MLC phosphorylation. These TNF-α-induced events can be prevented by the clinically relevant drug sulfasalazine.
2055222318	Abstract During egestive responses neuron B16 fires at 20 Hz, while neuron B15 is not active. During ingestive responses B16 fires for 0.5–1.0 s at 15–20 Hz, then B15 and B16 fire together, with B15 firing at 7.5–12 Hz. The duration of activity during ingestive responses depends on consumption of food: when food is not consumed, bursts are shorter (e.g. 2 vs 4 s). This study establishes a basis for investigating the role of peripheral neuromodulation under physiologically relevant conditions.
2055222344	Abstract Treatment of adult male rats with five doses of phenobarbitone was repeated at 4-day and monthly intervals in order to study the memory of the derepression cycles of glucuronolactone dehydrogenase and cytochrome P-450 in the liver. When the interval was 1 month, further drug treatments resulted in a similar increase of these enzyme levels and the relative liver weight, both during the second and third treatments. If the next treatment was commenced after an interval of 4 days, when the enzyme levels were still high, significantly lower cytochrome P-450 levels were observed after the third, than after the first and second treatments, and furthermore, after the third treatment the decline of cytochrome P-450 was more rapid than after the first phenobarbitone treatment. The increase and decrease of glucuronolactone dehydrogenase activity took place at a considerably slower rate than that of cytochrome P-450. After five phenobarbitone administrations there was a significant increase of cytochrome P-450 and also of glucuronolactone dehydrogenase for up to 48 hr, followed by a decrease to normal level of cytochrome P-450 in 8 days. On the eighth day glucuronolactone dehydrogenase activity was still nearly two-fold in comparison with the controls. The results indicate that successive phenobarbitone treatments do not result in any permanent memory effects in the metabolism of glucuronolactone dehydrogenase and cytochrome P-450, although if repeated with 4-day intervals a diminished inductive response was observed on the third treatment.
2055222348	"Abstract Human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells in culture exhibit epidermal growth factor (EGF)-induced ""down-regulation"" of cell-surface and total cellular (Triton X-100 extractable) EGF receptors caused entirely by an enhanced rate (4-fold) of receptor inactivation [Krupp, M. N., Connolly, D. T. & Lane, M. D. (1982) J. Biol. Chem. 257, 11489-11496]. The following observations show that this enhanced rate of EGF receptor inactivation is closely correlated with an increased cellular activity of plasminogen activator (PA), a serine protease. First, EGF-induced down-regulation of cell-surface and total cellular EGF receptors and the concomitant increase in cellular PA activity occur with identical kinetics, the t 1/2 for both processes being 3-3.5 hr. Second, the EGF dose-response curves for down-regulation of total cellular EGF receptor and increased PA activity are similar. The EGF concentrations for half-maximal responses of both processes are 10-15 nM and 20 nM, respectively. Third, the removal of EGF from previously down-regulated cells results in the recovery of total cellular EGF binding activity with a concurrent loss of cellular PA activity. Fourth, blocking PA synthesis or activity with cycloheximide or dexamethasone prevents down-regulation of the EGF receptor. Fifth, the addition of leupeptin, an inhibitor of PA and plasmin action, blocks EGF-induced receptor down-regulation as well as the increase of PA activity. That EGF receptor down-regulation is independent of plasminogen per se in the culture medium suggests that PA-mediated events may initiate the rapid inactivation of the EGF receptor that occurs during down-regulation."
2055222402	Raf kinases are essential for regulating cell proliferation, survival, and tumorigenesis. However, the mechanisms by which Raf is activated are still incompletely understood. Phosphorylation plays a critical role in Raf activation in response to mitogens. The present study characterizes phosphorylation of Ser338, a crucial event for Raf-1 activation. Here we report that mutation of Lys375 to Met diminishes phosphorylation of Ser338 on both wild type Raf-1 in cells treated with epidermal growth factor (EGF) or 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and a constitutively active mutant in which Tyr340/Tyr341 are replaced by 2 aspartic acids, a conserved substitution present in natural B-Raf. The loss of Ser338 phosphorylation in these Raf mutants is not engendered by a mutation-induced conformational change, inasmuch as mutation of another site (Ser471 to Ala) in the activation segment also abolishes Ser338 phosphorylation, whereas both the kinase-dead mutants of Raf-1 are phosphorylated well by active Pak1. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that EGF-stimulated phosphorylation of Ser338 is inhibited by Sorafenib, a Raf kinase inhibitor, but not by the MEK inhibitor U0126. Interestingly, a kinase-dead mutation and Sorafenib also markedly reduce phosphorylation of Ser445 on B-Raf, a site equivalent to Raf-1 Ser338. Finally, our data reveal that Ser338 is phosphorylated on inactive Raf-1 by an active mutant of Raf-1 when they are dimerized in cells and that artificial dimerization of Raf-1 causes Ser338 phosphorylation, accompanied by activation of ERK1/2. Altogether, our data suggest that Ser338 on Raf-1 is autophosphorylated in response to mitogens.
2055222436	Abstract During the past century, numerous workers have studied the interesting problem of the “double melting” of glycerides, and whilst it has long been known that this was due to polymorphism, the exact nature of this, and the relationship between the various polymorphic forms, was little understood. Indeed, as we now know, a clear explanation was hardly possible before the advent of x-ray diffraction methods. Once, however, that this new weapon had revealed the structure and also the general habit of polymorphism of simple long chain compounds (see Vol. 1, Ch. 1), the way was open for a new attack on this long-standing problem, and from 1934 onwards there appeared a series of thermal and x-ray studies of glycerides, by Malkin and his collaborators, which developed the present views on glyceride polymorphism. More, recently, Daubert, Lutton , and other U.S. workers have joined Malkin in this field.
2055222453	Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate intracellular parasite of the phylum Apicomplexa. The interaction of two well-studied proteins, Apical Membrane Antigen 1 (AMA1) and Rhoptry Neck protein 2 (RON2), has been shown to be critical for invasion by the asexual tachyzoite stage. Recently, two paralogues of these proteins, dubbed sporoAMA1 and sporoRON2 (or RON2L2), respectively, have been identified but not further characterized in proteomic and transcriptomic analyses of Toxoplasma sporozoites. Here, we show that sporoAMA1 and sporoRON2 localize to the apical region of sporozoites and that, in vitro, they interact specifically and exclusively, with no detectable interaction of sporoAMA1 with generic RON2 or sporoRON2 with generic AMA1. Structural studies of the interacting domains of sporoRON2 and sporoAMA1 indicate a novel pairing that is similar in overall form but distinct in detail from the previously described interaction of the generic pairing. Most notably, binding of sporoRON2 domain 3 to domains I/II of sporoAMA1 results in major alterations in the latter protein at the site of binding and allosterically in the membrane-proximal domain III of sporoAMA1 suggesting a possible role in signaling. Lastly, pretreatment of sporozoites with domain 3 of sporoRON2 substantially impedes their invasion into host cells while having no effect on tachyzoites, and vice versa for domain 3 of generic RON2 (which inhibits tachyzoite but not sporozoite invasion). These data indicate that sporozoites and tachyzoites each use a distinct pair of paralogous AMA1 and RON2 proteins for invasion into host cells, possibly due to the very different environment in which they each must function.
2055222557	Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of disease-related death in women globally. Detection of ovarian cancer using new biomarkers is necessary for early diagnosis. To date, there have been no obvious biomarkers for ovarian cancer detection in the incipient stage. In this study, we discovered potential diagnostic serological biomarkers for ovarian cancer using the Experion™ automated electrophoresis system. Sera from 14 healthy women and 84 ovarian cancer patients at stages I- IV were applied to the Experion to compare the protein expression levels. To examine the protein expression pattern of Experion data, proteins in the samples were resolved using 10 and 15% sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and visualized by silver staining. The candidate biomarkers elevated in ovarian cancer were purified and determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. α-2-macroglobulin (173.7 kDa), ceruloplasmin (147 kDa), inter-α-trypsin inhibitor family heavy chain-related protein (126 kDa), C-1 inhibitor (115.2 kDa) and hemoglobin α/β (14.4 kDa were overexpressed in the ovarian cancer sera. This study documents a novel way to measure ovarian cancer or cancer-related proteins for biomarkers using the Experion assay system, which should be easily adaptable for high-throughput diagnosis to establish databases of ovarian cancer for clinical applications.
2055222600	To elucidate the mechanism of obesity/metabolic syndrome-related hyperuricemia, this study aimed to determine the expression levels of transport systems for urate absorption (Urat1, Smct1, Glut9) and urate secretion (Abcg2). The kidneys of two obesity models in mice were used: 1) leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob mice) and 2) Quick fat diet model. 1) 8-week-old male ob/ob mice demonstrated the increased protein levels of Slc22a12 (Urat1), Slc2a9 (Glut9), and Abcg2 (Abcg2) and a decreased protein level of Slc5a8 (Smct1). However, no significant changes in the mRNA levels of these genes were observed. 2) C57BL/6 mice were fed with a Quick fat diet (crude fat content: 13.6%) from the age of 24 to 28 weeks (Quick fat diet group). The average body weights of the Quick fat diet group were heavier than those of the control group fed with a normal diet (crude fat content: 4.8%). The mRNA levels of Slc22a12, Slc2a9, Abcg2, or Slc5a8 did not change significantly in both groups. The protein levels of Slc22a12 (Urat1) and...
2055222617	Abstract We produced three murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the HIV-1 proteins. These three mAbs, namely CA-1, CA-2, CA-4, were IgG1 and all reacted with p24 on the HIV-1 Western blot. One of the mAbs, CA-4, also recognized p13, p21, p28, p29, p32, p39, p47, p55 on the Biotech/Du Pont HIV-1 Western blot strips and p21, p24, p28, p29, p39, p47, p55, p68, p80, p96, p110 on the Bio-Rad strips. CA-4 did not react with H-9 cell lysate nor with other retroviral antigens such as HTLV-1 or HIV-2 proteins. The binding of CA-4 to HIV-1 proteins was not blocked by deglycosylation. All three mAbs reacted with recombinant DNA derived capsid protein (p24) of HIV-1. These results suggest that many proteins in the HIV-1 Western blot contain antigenic epitope(s) similar to that of p24.
2055222642	The objectives of this study were to assess changes in nutritional status/body condition score, percentage pregnancy and calving rate in Zebu cows and to establish the relationship between body condition score loss and postpartum interval to resumption of ovarian activity. A total of 198 cows and postpubertal heifers of the Tanzanian Shorthorn Zebu kept under a traditional management system were randomly selected from 200 smallholder herds. Factors investigated during bi-weekly visits include body condition score (BCS), heart-girth circumference, milk yield and reproductive status of the animals, pregnancy/non-pregnancy and cyclicity/non-cyclicity. Local weather conditions and dates of occurrence of other reproductive events such as calving were also recorded. Calvings occurred all year round but with a strong seasonal distribution characterized by annual peaks observed between April and July. The annual calving pattern was closely related to rainfall, with peak precipitation occurring a few months before peak calving. The overall percentage pregnancy varied from 30% to 50% throughout the year. Postpartum cows exhibited minimum mean BCS and heart-girth circumference 12–14 weeks after calving, and cows with BCS loss >1 point exhibited the longest time interval from calving to onset of ovarian activity.
2055222665	A sequence of 86 bp within the 5' region of the adult chicken beta-globin gene was found to undergo a DNA conformational transition at elevated levels of negative superhelical stress (- sigma = 0.068). In vitro chemical DNA modification studies which detect purine hyperreactivity (HR) to the alkylating agent diethyl pyrocarbonate (DEP) have identified this 86 bp long DEP-HR element. The DEP-HR element is composed of small, tandem segments with imperfect purine-pyrimidine alternations. Methylation of cytosines within GCGC sequences of the DEP-HR element facilitates this structural change. The binding of a monoclonal anti-Z-DNA antibody to the element has been revealed by chemical footprinting with DEP. These data suggest that the DEP-HR sequence can undergo a conformational transition to Z-DNA. It is unknown whether the conformational flexibility observed here occurs in vivo.
2055222668	Objective: To determine the β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) isoforms ratio as a risk factor for Alzheimer's Disease and to assess its relationship with demographic and genetic variables of the disease. Methods: Blood samples from 26 patients fulfilling NINCDS-ADRDA diagnostic criteria for AD and 46 healthy control subjects were collected for Western blotting for βAPP. A ratio of βAPP isoforms, in optical densities, between the upper band (130 Kd) and the lower bands (106-110 Kd) was obtained. Odds ratios were obtained to determine risk factor of this component. Results: βAPP ratio on AD subjects was lower than that of control subjects: 0.3662 ± 0.1891 vs. 0.6769 ± 0.1021 (mean ± SD, p 0.05). Conclusions: Altered βAPP isoforms is a high risk factor for Alzheimer's disease, although it has no influence on the time of onset of the disease.
2055222686	A THOROUGH study of 20 autopsy cases of metastatic carcinoma to liver1,2 and kidney and of 72 cases of primary carcinoma of the liver (hepatoma)3,4 has revealed the following facts : (1) Continuity of structurally normal parenchyma with contiguous cancer parenchyma (Figs. 1 and 2). This was observed in 30 per cent of hepatoma cases in the liver and in 100 per cent of metastases to the liver and kidney. This higher percentage of positive findings in the material which promised less probability for this finding is ascribed to more careful sampling of blocks for sectioning. (2) Presence of single cancer cells in the vicinity of tumours as integral components of the host parenchyma, under conditions where invasion could be excluded (Fig. 3). (3) Morphological evidence for transformation of normal cells into cancer cells. (4) Transformation is preceded by cytochemical changes not visible with routine stains, but recognizable if special stains are applied.
2055222707	The bluegrass billbug, Sphenophorus paroulus Gyllenhal was a serious pest of home lawns for the 2nd successive season in isolated suburban areas of Rochester, N. Y. Overwintering adults were active by mid-May 1968, but populations high enough to produce damage were not present until the 1st week in July. Where 50 adults could be collected from paved streets, driveways, and sidewalks in 5 minutes, untreated lawns were subsequently completely destroyed.Insecticides, their formulations, and doses in ounces (oz) active ingredient per 1000 ft3 that produced 87+% control and prevented lawn damage included Baygon® (o-isopropoxyphenyl methylcarbamate)50wp and 5G at 30z, diazinon 2G and 14G at 3 oz, and carbaryl 80 wp at 6.4 oz.In laboratory tests, diazinon was the most effective insecticide, producing the highest mortality of larvae and adults infesting treated soil and adults feeding on treated grass stems. Results of field insecticide studies supplemented by laboratory tests points toward the evidence that adults were killed before ovipositing, resulting in protection of lawns from billbug injury.
2055222716	Owing to a rise in frequency and change in pattern of cases with fungaemia at our tertiary care centre, we conducted a prospective study for 4 months to understand the epidemiology and outcome of this infection. Detailed case histories including management protocol and outcomes were noted. Records of 140 cases with fungaemia (27.1% adult and 72.9% paediatric patients) were analysed. Although C. tropicalis was the most common yeast isolated, significantly higher isolation of C. guilliermondii (30.4%) and C. pelliculosa (17.6%) was noted in paediatric patients; and C. albicans (26.3%) and C. glabrata (10.5%) in adult patients. Rare species isolated included C. ustus (0.7%) and Trichosporon asahii (2.1%). Mortality was high (56.9% and 47.4%, respectively), in both groups of patients. Resistance to azoles (fluconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole) emerged in C. albicans (12.5-18.8%) and C. tropicalis (10.2-13.6%). Antifungal susceptibility testing report modified the therapy from fluconazole to amphotericin B in 8 patients; 5 survived. In conclusion, the study highlighted the rise of non-albicans Candida species in our hospital with differential distribution in paediatric and adult wards and emergence of azole resistance.
2055222724	Summary Mitosis is thought to be triggered by the activation of Cdk-cyclin complexes [1, 2]. Here we have used RNA interference (RNAi) to assess the roles of three mitotic cyclins, cyclins A2, B1, and B2, in the regulation of centrosome separation and nuclear-envelope breakdown (NEB) in HeLa cells. We found that the timing of NEB was affected very little by knocking down cyclins B1 and B2 alone or in combination. However, knocking down cyclin A2 markedly delayed NEB, and knocking down both cyclins A2 and B1 delayed NEB further. The timing of cyclin B1-Cdk1 activation was normal in cyclin A2 knockdown cells, and there was no delay in centrosome separation, an event apparently controlled by the activation of cytoplasmic cyclin B1-Cdk1 [3]. However, nuclear accumulation of cyclin B1-Cdk1 was markedly delayed in cyclin A2 knockdown cells. Finally, a constitutively nuclear cyclin B1, but not wild-type cyclin B1, restored normal NEB timing in cyclin A2 knockdown cells. These findings show that cyclin A2 is required for timely NEB, whereas cyclins B1 and B2 are not. Nevertheless cyclin B1 translocates to the nucleus just prior to NEB in a cyclin A2-dependent fashion and is capable of supporting NEB if rendered constitutively nuclear.
2055222778	Abstract Spatial and temporal biodiversity patterns of free-living marine nematodes were studied in Cienfuegos Bay, a tropical semi-enclosed basin in the Caribbean Sea. Taxonomic (to species level) and functional (biological trait) approaches were applied for describing the assemblage structure and relating it to abiotic environment based on a sampling scheme in six subtidal stations and three months. Biological trait approach added relevant information to species pattern regarding relationships between diversity patterns and the abiotic environment. The most common morphotypes were deposit feeding nematodes, with colonising abilities of 2–3 (in a scale from 1 to 5), tail conical cylindrical or filiforme and body slender; and their abundance were correlated with depth, organic matter and silt/clay fraction. In spite of a high turnover of species, functional diversity of assemblages did not change notably in space and time. A result probably due to sampling of the habitat pool of species and to low heterogeneity of the studied muddy bottoms. Chemical pollution (organic enrichment and heavy metals) and hydrodynamic regime possibly drove the biodiversity patterns. Spatial distribution of assemblages support the existence of two well differentiated basins inside the bay, the northern basin more polluted than the southern one. The low hydrodynamic regime would determine a poor dispersion of nematodes resulting in high spatial variance in the assemblage structure; and also the associated hypoxic conditions and pollutants in sediments can explain the dominance of tolerant nematode species such as Daptonema oxycerca, Sabatieria pulchra, Terschellingia gourbaultae, and Terschellingia longicaudata. A comparison of spatial–temporal patterns of biodiversity between Cienfuegos Bay and other semi-enclosed bays in temperate regions suggests several similarities: nematode assemblages are strongly influenced by anthropogenic disturbance, temporal trends are weak or overridden by spatial ones, and few cosmopolitan genera/species tolerant to pollution and hypoxic conditions are dominant.
2055222783	Abstract: Intercropping can improve field microclimates, decrease the incidence of crop diseases, and increase crop yields, but the reasons for this remain unknown. Solar radiation is the most important environmental influence. To understand the mechanisms of intercropping we established an experiment consisting of three cropping patterns: a monocropping control (treatment A) and two intercropping treatments (B: two rows of maize and two rows of soybean intercropping; C: two rows of maize and four rows of soybean intercropping). Results show that compared to monocropping, intercropping increased the amount of light penetrating to inferior leaves in maize plants. Light intensity reaching maize plants at the heading stage in intercropping increased over two-fold at 30 cm above ground and 10-fold at 70 cm above ground, compared with monocropping. At the flowering to maturity stage, light intensity at 110. 160 and 210 cm above ground among maize plants was greatly increased in intercropping compared with mono...
2055222808	Down syndrome (DS), as a phenotypic result of trisomy 21, is the most frequent aneuploidy at birth and the most common known genetic cause of mental retardation. DS is also characterized by other phenotypes affecting many organs, including brain, muscle, heart, limbs, gastrointestinal tract, skeleton, and blood. Any of the human chromosome 21 (Hsa21) genes may contribute to some of the DS phenotypes. To determine which of the Hsa21 genes are involved in DS, the effects of disrupting and overexpressing individual human gene orthologs in model organisms, such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, can be analyzed. Here, we isolated and characterized C21orf80 (human chromosome 21 open reading frame 80), a potential novel protein O-fucosyltransferase gene that encodes three alternatively spliced transcripts. Transient expression of tagged C21orf80 proteins suggests a primary intracellular localization in the Golgi apparatus. To gain insight into the biological role of C21orf80 and its potential role in DS, we isolated its C. elegans ortholog, pad-2, and performed RNA interference (RNAi) and overexpression experiments. pad-2(RNAi) embryos showed failure to undergo normal morphogenesis. Transgenic worms with elevated dosage of pad-2 displayed severe body malformations and abnormal neuronal development. These results show that pad-2 is required for normal development and suggest potential roles for C21orf80 in the pathogenesis of DS.
2055222847	The indigenous yeast microflora on Arkansas-grown White Riesling (Vitis vinifera) grapes and in model musts were examined during fermentation of sulfite-treated (0, 25, 50, or 100 mg/L total SO2) musts held at two temperatures 113°C and 21°CL The yeast microflora were examined with time −13°C musts were sampled it 5, 10, and 20 days; 21°C musts were sampled at 2, 4, and 8 days. A two log cycle increase in yeast counts occurred during fermentation, with little difference in counts due to sulfite treatments. Of 70 isolates, the main genera were Cryptococcus, Hanseniaspora, Pichia, Saccharomycopsis, Trichosporon, Zygosaccharomyces, Rhodotorula, Candida, Metschnikowia, and Succharomyces. All isolates recovered showed lipolytic activity on Spirit Blue Agar.
2055222869	It has been proposed that all live born females with Turner syndrome carry a cell line containing two sex chromosomes, which may be present at a low level of mosaicism (Hook & Warburton, 1983; Hassold et al. 1985; 1988; Connor & Loughlin, 1989). If the second sex chromosome is a Y, these patients are at risk of developing gonadoblastoma. In this study, 50 patients found to have a 45,X karyotype by conventional cytogenetic analysis, were screened by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), for the presence of Y chromosome sequences. Two patients were positive for six of the eight Y chromosome loci tested and additional cytogenetic analysis confirmed the presence of a marker chromosome, in 8% and 3% of cells respectively. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to confirm that the markers were of Y chromosome origin and helped to elucidate their structure. In addition, four other patients were found to have a Y chromosome by initial routine cytogenetic analysis. FISH, in conjunction with PCR, elucidated the structure of the Y chromosomes. This study illustrates the value of using a combination of cytogenetic and molecular techniques, to identify Y chromosome sequences in Turner syndrome.
2055222883	The eighth annual Human Genome Variation Meeting was held in September 2006 in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, China. The meeting highlighted recent advances in characterization of genetic variation, including genome-wide association studies and structural variation.
2055222884	The calf contains two types of Peyer's patches (PPs): jejunal and ileal. The ileal PP has been thought to be equivalent to the bursa of Fabricius (BF) as a central lymphoid organ. The morphologies of ileal and jejunal PPs in the calf were compared with those of the BF and the caecal tonsil (CT) in the chicken. Immunoglobulin G–positive (IgG+) cells appear in the follicles of them all and exhibited a dendritic appearance after birth. We investigated whether the IgG in these follicles was produced in situ. IgG-producing cells were detected in the follicular medullas of the jejunal PP and the CT, but not in those of the ileal PP and the BF. CD4+ cells were distributed in the follicular medullas of the jejunal PP and the CT, but not in those of the ileal PP and the BF. The data suggest that Ig class switching occurs in both jejunal PP follicles and CT follicles, but does not occur in either the ileal PP follicles or the bursal follicles. Because CD4+ T cells would be prerequisite for Ig class switching in these follicles, IgG+ cells of the follicular medullas in the ileal PP and the BF would trap immune complexes from the gut lumen. The primary B-cell repertoire might be selected by gut-derived antigens in the ileal PP and the BF before seeding the periphery. Anat Rec 266:207–217, 2002. © 2002 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
2055222975	DNA of hepatitis B virus (HBV DNA) in sera from HBeAg-positive carriers is now the most important and reliable marker of infectivity, but its significance in the progression of chronic hepatitis in anti-HBe carrier status is still under discussion. In this study, viral DNA was tested by a simplified spot hybridization method in sera of 206 HBeAg-negative Italian subjects. In a group of 153 HBsAg carriers, we found that 15.6% of anti-HBe-positive and 10.5% of anti-HBe-negative samples contained viral DNA. No HBV DNA was revealed in 38 HBsAg-negative nor in 15 anti-HBs-positive subjects with different serological markers of HBV. Viral DNA in sera of HBeAg-negative patients with severe chronic liver disease was correlated with increased alaninetransferase activity and IgM anti-HBc. Thus the presence of HBV DNA in these sera not only predicts which subjects are potentially infectious but also indicates chronic progression of hepatitis. Finally, viral DNA extracted from Dane particles of nine anti-HBe-positive sera was characterized by the Southern blot technique. The hybridization pattern shows bands indicating the presence of replicative intermediates.
2055222985	The ENY2/Sus1 is a multifunctional transcription factor which couples transcription with mRNA export. It is the component of the SAGA/TFTC and TREX-2/AMEX protein complexes. Recently, we described the interaction of ENY2 with one more protein complex, THO. Moreover, our data indicate that ENY2 associates with other nuclear and cytoplasmic factors. Thus, being the component of a number of protein complexes, ENY2 plays the role of an adaptor molecule, involved into the integration of different cellular processes, specifically, subsequent stages of gene expression.
2055223042	Australian magpies (Gymnorhina tibicen) are notable for their vocal prowess. We investigated the syringeal and respiratory dynamics of vocalization by two 6-month-old males, whose songs had a number of adult features. There was no strong lateral syringeal dominance and unilateral phonation was most often achieved by closing the syringeal valve on the contralateral side of the syrinx. Unlike other songbirds studied, magpies sometimes used an alternative syringeal motor pattern during unilateral phonation in which both sides of the syrinx are partially adducted and open to airflow. Also, in contrast to most other songbirds, the higher fundamental frequency during two-voice syllables was usually generated on the left side of the syrinx. Amplitude modulation, a prominent feature of magpie song, was produced by linear or nonlinear interactions between different frequencies which may originate either on opposite sides of the syrinx or on the same side. Pulse tones, similar to vocal fry in human speech, were present in some calls. Unlike small songbirds, the fundamental of the modal frequency can be as low as that of the pulse tone, suggesting that large birds may have evolved pulse tones to increase acoustic diversity, rather than decrease the fundamental frequency.

2055223108	Four distinct genotypes of hepatitis C virus types I, II, III and IV have been identified by comparison of nucleotide sequences of isolates from different areas of the world. We examined the possibility that hepatitis C virus may have serologically definable subtypes. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay systems were prepared by use of two synthetic peptides deduced from the putative core protein of hepatitis C virus. The following are the two peptides that were used: (a) IPKARRPEGRTWAQPGY (subtype-1) conserved in hepatitis C virus isolates with type I and type II genotypes; and (b) IPKDRRSTGKSWGKPGY (subtype-2) conserved in type III and type IV genotypes. With the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays, the subtype-1 antibodies were detected in 26 (68%) of 38 subjects whose hepatitis C virus RNA had been genotyped as type I or type II, whereas subtype-2 antibodies were not detected. Inversely, the subtype-2 antibodies were detected in 10 (56%) of 18 subjects with hepatitis C virus RNA genotypes III or IV, whereas subtype-1 antibodies were detected in none of them. These results suggest that hepatitis C virus has two serologically distinguishable core antigen subtypes, corresponding to either genotype I/II or genotype III/IV. Subtyping of HCV by serological methods would contribute to tracking transmission routes of the virus, especially in cases where serum samples were not stored under conditions to preserve RNA or in infected hosts who have cleared the virus and therefore have only antibodies remaining to identify the infection.

2055223113	Abstract Immunization with heat-inactivated herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) 2–5 days before ocular infection reduced the frequency of establishment of latent HSV-1 infection in the trigeminal ganglion (TG); this induction of resistence coincided with reduced expression of IFN-γ mRNA in the TG. Immunization with unrelated antigens was not protective. In part, this resistance to nervous system invasion correlated with the appearance of serum antibody to HSV-1. Immunization reduced viral replication in the eye and trigeminal ganglion, and prevented HSV-1 spread to the cerebellum. IFN-γ was detected in immunized mice 4 days postocular infection as determined by plaque reduction using neutralizing Ab to IFN-α/β and IFN-γ. Injection of antibody (Ab) to IFN-α/β and IFN-γ administered at the time of immunization did not affect survival. Anti-IFN-γ-treated mice had significantly reduced levels of IFN in their serum. Treatment with anti-IFN-α/β Ab resulted in an elevation in viral replication as determined by the expression of latency associated transcripts in the TG of mice. Likewise, there was a significant increase in the CD8, IL-12 (p40), and TNF-α mRNA levels in the TG of the anti-IFN-α/β-treated mice. TG explant cultures demonstrated that viral load was significantly increased in the TG of anti-IFN-α/β-treated mice relative to TG of control mice 7 days after infection. The results suggest that exposure to viral antigens 2–5 days before infection is an important determinant of the extent of HSV-1 spread to the nervous system. Moreover, the data suggest that both an antibody response and IFN-α/β play a role in limiting the progress of infection from the peripheral tissues to the central nervous system.
2055223118	The dichloromethane extracts of the root and leaf of Tephrosia vogelii Hook F. (Family: Papilionaceae) grown in Kenya, were subjected to antimicrobial assays against Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Fusarium phoseolida . The minimum inhibition concentrations (MIC) ranged between 0.25 to 6.4 μg/ml for all the microorganisms tested. The crude root and leaf extracts were also toxic to the brine shrimps, organisms used as indicators of toxicity (LC50: 0.960; 0.958 μg/ml, respectively). Chromatographic separation led to the identification of (6as, 12as, 5's)-6a, 12a, 4',5'-tetra hydro-2,3-dimethoxy 5'-s- isopropenyl–furano (3',2': 8,9)-6H-rotoxen-12-one, (rotenone) in 9.75% yield, (roots), and 11.75% (leaves). Characterisation was achieved by use of spectroscopic techniques and comparison with rotenone standard and literature data. Novel HPLC conditions for purification of rotenoids were established. The MIC of rotenone against the tested microbes was found to be 5.2 and 1.0 μg/ml for Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia col i respectively, while the LC50 against the brine shrimps was found to be 3.20 μg/ml. The findings indicate that the extracts of T. vogelii contain metabolites that have antimicrobial activity comparable to other medicinal plants.

2055223225	Abstract Four alkaloids, 5′-des- O -methylharringtonine, 3′ S -hydroxy-5′-des- O -methylharringtonine, 5′-des- O -methylhomoharringtonine and 5′-des- O -methylisoharringtonine, were isolated from the leaves and stems of C. harringtonia var. drupacea. Their structures were established by 1 H and 13 C NMR spectroscopic studies, chemical conversions to known alkaloids and applying the advanced Mosher's method for the secondary alcohol moiety.
2055223233	Fusarium isolates are divided into three chemotypes according to produce of  class B trichothecenes; 3-acetyldeoxynivalenol (3ADON)  15-acetyldeoxynivalenol (15ADON) and nivalenol (NIV) and 4-  acetyldeoxynivalenol (NIV) chemotypes. In this study, chemotyping of  seventeen isolates from Turkey and Iran belonging to F. graminearum, F.  culmorum, F. poae and F. pseudograminearum species were carried out by  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis. While all F. culmorum and F. poae  isolates determined as 3ADON, remaining F. graminearum and F.  pseudograminearum isolates were either 3ADON or 15ADON chemotypes. A common  band of 583 bp long DNA fragment was amplified in all of F. culmorum and F.  poae, one F. pseudograminearum (21F) and four F. graminearum (14F, sh14,  sh15, sh7) isolates with 3ADON chemotype. However, remaining two F.  pseudograminearum and four F. graminearum isolates with 15ADON chemotype,  yielded amplicons that of 863 bp. It was shown that 3ADON was more  predominant chemotype from other class B trichothecenes. This is the first  report on chemotyping of F. poae and F. pseudograminearum isolates and also  to show presence of 3ADON chemotype in F. graminearum isolate from Turkey.
2055223244	Abstract Castrated male quails, exposed to long days (16L:8D), were implanted with 10 mm silastic capsules (internal diameter: 1,57 mm) containing testosterone or 5α-dihydrotestosterone (5α-DHT) or they were injected with estradiol benzoate (EB). The effects of these manipulations on cloacal gland growth, plasma levels of gonadotropins (FSH and LH), sexual behaviour and on testosterone metabolism in the brain and in the anterior pituitary were assessed. The cloacal gland size was much increased by testosterone and 5α-DHT and the conversion of testosterone to 5β-reduced metabolites in the pituitary was depressed by treatments with 5α-DHT and/or EB. Only minor effects were observed in the plasma levels of gonadotropins and in sexual behaviour except crowing, which was stimulated by testosterone and by the combined treatment with 5α-DHT and EB. This study shows that the cloacal gland is more sensitive to androgens than the brain areas that control sexual behaviour through the negative feedback of gonadal ste...
2055223261	Abstract Hepatosomatic indices and biochemical profile of the male morphotypes of Macrobrachium rosembergii such as small males, weak orange clawed males, strong orange clawed males, pre-transforming strong orange clawed males, weak blue clawed males, strong blue clawed males of grow-outs and old blue clawed males from the Vembanad lake were studied. Size characterization of M. rosenbergii agreed with the earlier reports. A marked variation in hepatosomatic index (HSI) of morphotypes indicated the possibility of differences in food assimilation and growth rates. Mean HSI values were highest in strong orange clawed males (6.351) and lowest in small males (2.814). Among the various biochemical components of male morphotypes studied, protein, RNA and DNA in muscle tissue as well as carbohydrate and RNA in hepatopancreas showed significant differences. Faster somatic growth observed in strong orange clawed males can be correlated with the higher values of protein, DNA and RNA recorded in the muscle tissue as well as high HSI, carbohydrate and RNA contents of hepatopancreas. The results of the present study reveal that there exists perceptible variations in HSI and biochemical profiles among the male morphotypes of M. rosenbergii .
2055223282	Serum fructosamine concentration falls with an increase in plasma protein turnover. Since this increase is a feature of gastrointestinal parasite infection at all sites, a falling serum fructosamine level may be of general application in the interpretation of parasite-related events. The circulating fructosamine level was investigated in the lamb as an indicator of protein-losing gastroenteropathy associated with two parasites at different sites, Ostertagia circumcincta (abomasum) and Nematodirus spathiger (small intestine). Infection with 10,000 N spathiger infective larvae daily for seven weeks produced only slight clinical signs, and only a small change in serum fructosamine levels. 2500 O circumcincta L3 daily gave no clinical signs in most animals, but serum fructosamine was more strongly affected in this group. Concurrent infection with both organisms caused some degree of diarrhoea in all lambs, and a sustained fall in serum fructosamine, more accentuated than that observed in either of the single infection groups, supporting the value of serum fructosamine determination in monitoring gastrointestinal parasitism.
2055223322	Abstract 1. 1. A procedure for the isolation of actively respiring particles from yeast is described. These particles are considered to be mitochondria. They stain vitally with Janus green B and oxidize the main citric acid cycle substrates as well as pyruvate and acetate. 2. 2. The washed mitochondria oxidize pyruvate only in the presence of a catalytic amount of one of the Krebs cycle substrates. In the presence of catalytic amounts of malate, pyruvate is oxidized to carbon dioxide and water. 3. 3. The requirements for acetate oxidation are more specific than those for pyruvate. Unlike pyruvate, only α-ketoglutarate and citrate initiate acetate oxidation. The pathway by which acetate is dissimilated has not been established.
2055223405	Previous work has demonstrated that ischemic preconditioning neuroprotection is associated with inhibition of JNK pathway activation. The present study was designed to examine the hypothesis that the suppression of JNK3 activation by preconditioning is mediated by NMDA receptors and crosstalk between ERK1/2 and JNK3. Preconditioning (3 min ischemia) 2 days before global cerebral ischemia (8-min) markedly decreased neuronal degeneration in hippocampus CA1, an effect abolished by pretreatment with the NMDA receptor antagonist, MK-801. Furthermore, preconditioning abolished cerebral ischemia-induced JNK3 activation and enhanced ERK1/2 activation, an effect reversed by MK-801. Due to the inverse relationship between ERK1/2 and JNK3 activation following preconditioning, we hypothesized that ERK1/2 may regulate JNK3 activation following preconditioning. In support of this contention, pretreatment with the MEK inhibitor, PD98059 significantly attenuated preconditioning-induced ERK1/2 phosphorylation, and strongly reversed preconditioning down-regulation of JNK3 phosphorylation. This finding suggests that ERK1/2 signaling is responsible for preconditioning-induced down-regulation of JNK3 activation. Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry further demonstrated that preconditioning, in an NMDA-dependent manner, enhanced activation of the pro-survival factors, p-CREB and Bcl-2, while attenuating activation of putative pro-death factors, p-c-Jun and Fas-L in the hippocampus CA1. As a whole, the study demonstrates that preconditioning attenuation of pro-death JNK3 in the hippocampus CA1 following global cerebral ischemia is mediated by NMDA receptor-induced crosstalk between ERK1/2 and JNK3. The ERK1/2-mediated reduction of JNK3 activation leads to enhanced pro-survival signaling (P-CREB and Bcl-2 induction) and attenuation of pro-death signaling (p-c-Jun and Fas-L), with subsequent induction of ischemic tolerance.
2055223521	The presence of symbionts in the gut of Onychochaeta borincana has been suggested but they have never been characterized. The intestinal tissue of this species was examined using electron microscopy and microbiological and molecular biology techniques in order to identify the possible gut associated symbiont. Four gram-positive, endospore-forming and β-hemolytic bacterial strains remained adhered to the intestinal wall of these organisms even after intense cleaning. Molecular and physiological characterization proved their similarity with Bacillus genus, which is typically found in soils and has been reported as a possible intestinal symbiont in arthropods. These results were corroborated by SEM, which showed bacilli structures adhered to the intestinal wall. However, results of molecular tests indicate that a low number of microorganisms remained adhered to intestinal wall after intense cleaning.
2055223537	Many of the plant microRNA (miRNA) genes contain introns. The miRNA-containing hairpin loop structure is predominantly located within the first exon of such pri-miRNAs. We have shown that the downstream intron and its splicing are important for the regulation of the processing of these pri-miRNAs. The 5′ splice site in MIR genes is essential in the process of miRNA biogenesis. We postulate that the presence of yet undefined interactions between U1 snRNP and the pri-miRNA processing machinery leads to an increase in the efficiency of miRNA biogenesis. The 5′ splice site also decreases the accessibility of the polyadenylation machinery to the pri-miRNA polyA signal located within the same intron. It is likely that the spliceosome assembly controls the length and structure of MIR primary transcripts, and regulates mature miRNA levels. The emerging picture shows that introns, splicing, and/or alternative splicing have highly relevant roles in regulating the miRNA levels in very specific conditions that contribute to proper plant response to stress conditions.
2055223560	Posttranslational modifications of histones play an essential role in heterochromatin assembly. Whereas the role of Clr4/Suv39h-mediated methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9) in heterochromatin assembly is well studied, the exact function of histone deacetylases (HDACs) in this process is unclear. We show that Clr3, a fission yeast homolog of mammalian class II HDACs, acts in a distinct pathway parallel to RNAi-directed heterochromatin nucleation to recruit Clr4 and mediate H3K9 methylation at the silent mating-type region and centromeres. At the mat locus, Clr3 is recruited at a specific site through a mechanism involving ATF/CREB family proteins. Once recruited, Clr3 spreads across the 20 kb silenced domain that requires its own HDAC activity and heterochromatin proteins including Swi6/HP1. We also demonstrate that Clr3 contributes to heterochromatin maintenance by stabilizing H3K9 trimethylation and by preventing histone modifications associated with active transcription, and that it limits RNA polymerase II accessibility to naturally silenced repeats at heterochromatin domains.
2055223582	The involvement of cytochrome P450nor (P450nor) is the most striking feature of the fungal denitrifying system, and has never been shown in bacterial systems. To establish the physiological significance of the P450nor, we constructed and investigated mutants of Fusarium oxysporum that lacked the gene for P450nor. We mutated the gene by targeted integration of a disrupted gene into the chromosome of F. oxysporum. The mutants were shown to contain neither P450nor protein nor nitric oxide (NO) reductase (Nor) activity, implying that they are indeed deficient in P450nor. These mutants had apparently lost the denitrifying activity and failed to evolve nitrous oxide (N2O) upon incubation under oxygen-limiting conditions in the presence of nitrate. Their mycelia exhibited normal levels of dissimilatory nitrite reductase (Nir) activity and were able to evolve NO under these conditions. The promoter region of the P450nor gene was fused to lacZ and introduced into the wild-type strain of F. oxysporum. The transformed strain produced β-galactosidase under denitrifying conditions as efficiently as the wild type does P450nor. These results represent unequivocal genetic evidence that P450nor is essential for the reduction of NO to N2O, the last step in denitrification by F. oxysporum.
2055223609	Muskelin is a novel intracellular protein, identified in mouse cells, that acts as a mediator of cell spreading and cytoskeletal responses to the extracellular matrix component thrombospondin-1. We report that human muskelin is 98% identical with mouse muskelin at the amino acid level. The human muskelin gene is located at 7q32. The mouse muskelin gene maps syntenically at chromosome 6 B1/B2.
2055223655	Retinol is stored in liver in the form of its esters. The retinol-esterifying enzyme lecithin:retinol acyltransferase (LRAT) catalyzes the conversion of retinol into its storage form. Expression of the LRAT mRNA is induced by retinoic acid (RA), or by dietary vitamin A, and is downregulated upon vitamin A depletion. RA also induces the expression in liver of the mRNA for CYP26, the enzyme that disposes of excess RA by oxidizing RA to 4-oxo-RA. CYP26 is downregulated upon vitamin A depletion.
2055223681	Fifty-four species of insects, 5 of spiders, 5 of mites, 1 harvestman and 1 nematode co-occurred with the eastern larch beetle,Dendroctonus simplex LeConte, on tamarack,Larix laricina (Du Roi) K. Koch, at 2 localities in Newfoundland. The most abundant predators were the flyMedetera gaspensis Bickel and the beetleRhizophagus dimidiatus Mannerheim and the most abundant parasitoids were the HymenopteraSpathius canadensis Ashmead,Rhopalicus tutela (Walker) andRoptrocerus xylophagorum (Ratzburg).D. simplex is recorded as a new host for 9 predator and 3 parasitoid species.
2055223721	Treatment with bacterial lipopolysaccharide elicits the appearance of greater numbers of background antigen-specific plaque-forming cells (PFC) in the spleens of mice previously exposed or primed to subimmunogenic amounts of various non-cross-reacting antigens so as to generate detectable immunological memory. These findings suggest that treatment with lipopolysaccharide results in the activation of increased numbers of antigen-primed or memory B cells in mice previously exposed to antigen.
2055223833	Grasshopper communities were sampled in three associated habitats of the Central Basin of Tennesee: cedar glades, xeric limestone prairies, and cedar hardwood forest. Twenty-five grasshopper species were collected across all three habitats. Eleven species were found in the cedar glades, 12 species were collected in the xeric limestone prairies, and six species were collected from the cedar-hardwood forests. A Principal Component Analysis of the resulting species lists indicated that grasshopper community composition differed significantly between each habitat. Four new state records for Tennessee were documented during this survey. An annotated species list is presented.
2055223844	Abstract BACKGROUND & AIMS: Ursodeoxycholic acid prevents gallstone formation in selected patients. The aim of this study was to examine whether decreased concentration and nucleation-promoting activity of various proteins contribute to this beneficial effect. METHODS: Gallbladder bile of 13 patients with cholesterol gallstones treated with ursodeoxycholic acid (10 mg/kg(-1)/day(-1)) and of 13 untreated patients were compared. RESULTS: Total protein concentration in gallbladder bile (2.8 +/- 0.6 vs. 6.7 +/- 1.3 mg/mL; P=0.008) and concanavalin A-binding fraction (0.16 +/- 0.03 vs. 0.42 +/- 0.07 mg/mL; P=0.003) were strongly decreased by ursodeoxycholic acid therapy. Significant decreases were also found for gallbladder bile alpha1-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobin, immunoglobulin (Ig) A, IgG, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, and aminopeptidase N but not for IgM, mucin, or beta- glucuronidase. Decreases were most pronounced for proteins of canalicular membrane origin. Gallbladder bile total protein correlated with cholesterol saturation index (r=0.54; P=0.0047) but not with bile salt hydrophobicity index. Crystallization-promoting activity of the concanavalin A-binding fraction (assessed by nephelometry and microscopic examination) was also significantly decreased by ursodeoxycholic acid. CONCLUSIONS: Ursodeoxycholic acid strongly decreases levels of various proteins and nucleation-promoting activity in bile. (Gastroenterology 1996 Apr;110(4):1225-37)
2055223864	Members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascade are important for the establishment of a Leishmania mexicana infection and are involved in flagellar length control, although the underlying molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This study reports the cloning and characterization of LmxPK4, a MAP kinase kinase homologue of L. mexicana displaying putative plant-like regulatory phosphorylation sites. The recombinant protein has autophosphorylating activity and phosphorylates myelin basic protein. An LmxPK4 gene deletion mutant showed a proliferation defect after infection of macrophages and no or delayed lesion development in mice. Irrespective of the onset of lesion development parasites showed an early and homogeneous lesion development in re-infection experiments. This is indicative for a compensation of the null mutant phenotype. Additionally, this phenotype could be reverted by reintroduction of the wild-type gene into the deletion background. Mutants expressing loss-of-function or N-terminally truncated versions of LmxPK4 retained the null mutant phenotype. LmxPK4 is stage-specifically expressed in promastigotes and during differentiation to amastigotes, but is not detectable in amastigotes isolated from the mammalian host. Moreover, its in vitro kinase activity increases with temperature rise up to 40 degrees C. Our results suggest that LmxPK4 is involved in the differentiation process and affects virulence of Leishmania mexicana.
2055223894	Given the fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) may respond to the intracellular milieu of the macrophage with the induction of environmentally regulated genes required for survival and growth of the bacteria we assumed that the protein kinases may also be the factors in Mycobacterium–macrophage interaction. Since, protein kinases play a major role in various critical cellular processes including regulation of immune responses, we describe the fate of expression and phosphorylation of protein kinase C in macrophage cell lines exposed to Mtb H37Rv and raised the question whether the change in the events of expression and phosphorylation are the results of direct interaction of bacilli with macrophages and/or, are also indirectly mediated by specific cytokines that are induced in response to exposure. Our results show that only novel PKCs are phosphorylated during infection of macrophages by pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria and the alteration is a result of direct host-bacilli association which is independent of cytokines as mediators. Expression of PKC-α (conventional PKC isoform) was down regulated by Mtb H37Rv. In contrast the non-pathogenic fast grower Mycobacterium smegmatis (MS) increased the expression and phosphorylation of PKC-α. PKC-α was also increased in macrophages treated with serum of mice immunized with Mtb H37Rv. The study has shown that pathogenic and non-pathogenic mycobacteria categorically select the type of protein kinases C for activation/deactivation.
2055223977	The effect of recombinant DNA-produced human tumor necrosis factor (TNF) on various parameters of neutrophil function was evaluated. TNF was a weak direct activator of oxygen radical production. It released the specific granule contents to a limited extent, but the azurophilic granule contents were retained even in the presence of cytochalasin B. It had a chemotactic activity for neutrophils, as determined by the use of a modified Boyden's chamber. Pretreatment of neutrophils with TNF increased phagocytosis of opsonized particles and markedly potentiated in a dose-dependent manner oxygen radical production induced by opsonized zymosan. The inhibitors of lipoxygenase, but not those of cyclooxygenase, reduced the potentiating effect of TNF on phagocytosis, suggesting that the products of lipoxygenase play an important role in mediating the effect of TNF on neutrophils.
2055224019	Many rocky intertidal areas are subject to periodic sand inundations due to a natural cycle of sand movement that is being altered and intensified by human activities. Though sand is thought to be a major structuring force in intertidal communities, little experimental research has been done to investigate its effects on intertidal organisms. Assemblages of meio- and macrofauna that inhabit intertidal coralline algal turf have been especially neglected in regards to manipulative research on the effects of sand. In this study sand was added daily to coralline turf plots to maintain depths of either 3 or 6 cm for 1 mo. Within 1 h of sand addition, faunal community composition had changed significantly due to a decrease in the abundances of highly mobile animals. Another shift was seen 2 wk later when abundances of psammophilic gastropods increased. One month after sand addition had ceased, communities in treatment plots again resembled those of the controls. This experiment demonstrated that turf communities rapidly respond to and recover from local physical disturbances due to sand inundation.
2055224031	The majority of bacterial proteins are exported across the cytoplasmic membrane via the Sec pathway, but also the more recently discovered twin-arginine translocation (Tat) route seems to play an important role for protein secretion in Streptomyces lividans in whose genome tatA, tatB and tatC have been identified. In the present work we showed that simultaneous overproduction of TatABC improved the Tat-dependent secretion capacity as could be concluded from the increased amount of secreted xylanase C, an exclusive Tat-dependent substrate. This result demonstrates that next to the availability of energy to drive secretion, also the number of translocases can be rate-limiting for Tat-dependent secretion. On the other hand, tatABC overexpression was found to diminish secretion of the Sec-dependent proteins xylanase B and subtilisin inhibitor in S. lividans. These results reveal cross-talk between both pathways in S. lividans.
2055224056	Most X-linked nonsyndromic hearing loss is caused by various types of mutations of the POU domain class 3 transcription factor 4 gene (POU3F4). We found five unique missense and frameshift truncation and extension mutations in Korean patients. Two missense mutations (p.Thr211Met and p.Gln229Arg) disturbed transcriptional activity. Two frameshift extension mutations (p.Thr354GlnfsX115 and p.X362ArgextX113) were located outside of POU domain and nuclear localization signal (NLS) at the C-terminus. POU3F4 protein levels were low and could be restored by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor, in vitro. These mutant POU3F4 proteins were exclusively localized to the cytoplasm and did not have transcriptional activity. Frameshift mutation (p.Leu317PhefsX12) in POU3F4 leads to the truncation of the C-terminal 44 amino acids spanning the POU domain and NLS. This frameshift truncation mutant protein was located in both the nucleus and cytoplasm and was present at low protein levels. This mutant was also transcriptionally inactive, even in the presence of MG132. From these results, we conclude that frameshift truncation and extension mutations in the C-terminus of POU3F4 lead to cytoplasmic localization and subsequent proteosomal degradation due to structural aberrations, which cause transcriptional inactivity and thus nonsyndromic hearing loss.
2055224057	Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a prevalent X-linked neuromuscular disease for which there is currently no cure. Recently, it was demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model that utrophin could functionally compensate for the lack of dystrophin and alleviate the muscle pathology (Tinsley, J. M., Potter, A. C., Phelps, S. R., Fisher, R., Trickett, J. I., and Davies, K. E. (1996) Nature 384, 349–353). In this context, it thus becomes essential to determine the cellular and molecular mechanisms presiding over utrophin expression in attempts to overexpress the endogenous gene product throughout skeletal muscle fibers. In a recent study, we showed that the nerve exerts a profound influence on utrophin gene expression and postulated that nerve-derived trophic factors mediate the local transcriptional activation of the utrophin gene within nuclei located in the postsynaptic sarcoplasm (Gramolini, A. O., Dennis, C. L., Tinsley, J. M., Robertson, G. S., Davies, K. E, Cartaud, J., and Jasmin, B. J. (1997)J. Biol. Chem. 272, 8117–8120). In the present study, we have therefore focused on the effect of agrin on utrophin expression in cultured C2 myotubes. In response to Torpedo-, muscle-, or nerve-derived agrin, we observed a significant 2-fold increase in utrophin mRNAs. By contrast, CGRP treatment failed to affect expression of utrophin transcripts. Western blotting experiments also revealed that the increase in utrophin mRNAs was accompanied by an increase in the levels of utrophin. To determine whether these changes were caused by parallel increases in the transcriptional activity of the utrophin gene, we transfected muscle cells with a 1.3-kilobase pair utrophin promoter-reporter (nlsLacZ) gene construct and treated them with agrin for 24–48 h. Under these conditions, both muscle- and nerve-derived agrin increased the activity of β-galactosidase, indicating that agrin treatment led, directly or indirectly, to the transcriptional activation of the utrophin gene. Furthermore, this increase in transcriptional activity in response to agrin resulted from a greater number of myonuclei expressing the 1.3-kilobase pair utrophin promoter-nlsLacZ construct. Deletion of 800 base pairs 5′ from this fragment decreased the basal levels of nlsLacZ expression and abolished the sensitivity of the utrophin promoter to exogenously applied agrin. In addition, site-directed mutagenesis of an N-box motif contained within this 800-base pair fragment demonstrated its essential contribution in this regulatory mechanism. Finally, direct gene transfer studies performed in vivo further revealed the importance of this DNA element for the synapse-specific expression of the utrophin gene along multinucleated muscle fibers. These data show that both muscle and neural isoforms of agrin can regulate expression of the utrophin gene and further indicate that agrin is not only involved in the mechanisms leading to the formation of clusters containing presynthesized synaptic molecules but that it can also participate in the local regulation of genes encoding synaptic proteins. Together, these observations are therefore relevant for our basic understanding of the events involved in the assembly and maintenance of the postsynaptic membrane domain of the neuromuscular junction and for the potential use of utrophin as a therapeutic strategy to counteract the effects of Duchenne muscular dystrophy.
2055224091	Multiple gene expression alterations have been linked to Alzheimer's disease (AD), implicating multiple metabolic pathways in its pathogenesis. However, a clear distinction between AD-specific gene expression changes and those resulting from nonspecific responses to toxic aggregating proteins has not been made. We investigated alterations in gene expression induced by human beta-amyloid peptide (Aβ) in a Caenorhabditis elegans AD model. Aβ-induced gene expression alterations were compared with those caused by a synthetic aggregating protein to identify Aβ-specific effects. Both Aβ-specific and nonspecific alterations were observed. Among Aβ-specific genes were those involved in aging, proteasome function, and mitochondrial function. An intriguing observation was the significant overlap between gene expression changes induced by Aβ and those induced by Cry5B, a bacterial pore-forming toxin. This led us to hypothesize that Aβ exerts its toxic effect, at least in part, by causing damage to biological membranes. We provide in vivo evidence consistent with this hypothesis. This study distinguishes between Aβ-specific and nonspecific mechanisms and provides potential targets for therapeutics discovery.
2055224147	The characteristics of the nervous systems of a number of organisms in different phyla are examined at the recombinant DNA, protein, neuroanatomic, neurophysiological, and cognitive levels. Among the invertebrates, special attention is paid to the advantages as well as the shortcomings of the fly Drosophila melanogaster, the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, the honey bee Apis mellifera, the sea hare Aplysia californica, the octopus Octopus vulgaris, and the squid Loligo pealei. Among vertebrates, the focus is on Homo sapiens, the mouse Mus musculus, the rat Rattus norvegicus, the cat Felis catus, the macaque monkey Macaca fascicularis, the barn owl Tyto alba, and the zebrafish Brachydanio rerio. Vertebrate nervous systems have also been compared in fossil vs. extant organism. I conclude that complex nervous systems arose in the Early Cambrian via a big bang that was underpinned by a modular method of construction involving massive pleiotropy of gene circuits. This rapidity of construction had enormous implications for the degrees of freedom that were subsequently available to evolving nervous systems. I also conclude that at the level of neuronal populations and interactions of neuropiles there is no model system between phyla except at the basic macromolecular level. Further, I argue that to achieve a significant understanding of the functions of extant nervous systems we need to concentrate on fewer organisms in greater depth and manipulate genomes via transgenic technologies to understand the behavioral outputs that are possible from an organism. Finally, I analyze the concepts of “perceptual categorization” and “information processing” and the difficulties involved in the extrapolation of computer analogies to sophisticated nervous systems. © 1993 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.
2055224163	Detergent solubilized extracts of 125Iodogen surface-labelled Loa loa microfilariae revealed a relatively simple profile of two strongly labelled molecules of 23 and 67 kDa for blood microfilariae and several strongly labelled molecules of 23, 40, 42-67 kDa for in vitro born microfilariae. In addition, there were other weakly labelled molecules which were resolved after prolonged autoradiographic exposure. Surface molecules of 28, 29, and 33 kDa were unique to blood microfilariae, a 14.4 kDa molecule was unique to in vitro born microfilariae and molecules of 23, 40, and 75-84 kDa were common to both forms of microfilariae. The profile of excretory-secretory products consisted of molecules of 14.4-198 kDa. Human albumin was a predominant component of surface molecules and excretory-secretory products from blood microfilariae. Immunoprecipitation with occult and microfilaremic loaiasis sera demonstrated that the 23 kDa surface molecule and excretory-secretory products of 14.4 and 33 kDa were only recognized by occult loaiasis sera whereas surface molecules of 40 and 75-84 kDa and excretory-secretory products of 28 and 67 kDa were recognised by both sera. Studies with heterologous sera demonstrated that with the exception of the 75-84 kDa antigens, all the L. loa microfilarial surface antigens contained epitopes which were restricted to filarial parasites. Further studies revealed that the 23 kDa antigen was a protein which contained neither asparagine-N-linked oligosaccharides nor interchain disulfide-linkages.
2055224168	Abstract The gammarid composition at 25 sites in the rivers Danube, Main and the southern reaches of the Rhine were studied during the years 2002–2004. Dikerogammarus villosus and Echinogammarus ischnus were the most frequent species prevailing at 17 sites. Sympatric occurrence of D. villosus and E. ischnus was observed at 12 sites. Dikerogammarus haemobaphes was recorded at 7 sites; this species prevailed in the Danube, west of the Weltenburger Enge and in the Isar mouth where it co-existed with native species (Gammarus pulex and/or G. roeseli) at 6 sites. Dikerogammarus bispinosus and E. berilloni were found at only 1 site, where they co-existed with D. villosus and E. ischnus, and with D. villosus and native species, respectively. Investigation of reproductive characteristics at 3 sites showed that females of D. villosus and D. haemobaphes produced the biggest clutches with more than 100 eggs. Females of E. ischnus produced much smaller clutches (10–35 eggs on an average), but very big eggs. Clutch sizes and egg volumes of D. bispinosus and E. berilloni resembled those of native species. Our results suggest that the most successful invaders (D. villosus, D. haemobaphes and E. ischnus) display reproductive traits that facilitate their success. Both Dikerogammarus sp. allocate energy into production of many but small eggs, thus maximizing offspring number, while E. ischnus allocates its energy into production of fewer but large eggs which could be beneficial at sites where food is scarce.
2055224180	We analyzed specimens of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) from 110 patients for p53 gene mutations, and 92 of them for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, in order to evaluate the prognostic significance of these factors by comparison with clinical follow-up data. Mutations within the exons 5 to 8 of the p53 gene were found in 48 tumors (44%). Sequencing revealed in most cases mis-sense mutations (16/21). Frequency of p53 gene mutations was not related to the tumor stage or the presence of lymph node metastases. Of the 46 tumors that were analyzed by immunohistochemistry, 26 stained positively (56%). The number of positively stained nuclei increased slightly with decreasing differentiation of the tumors, whereas no correlation was found between tumor stage and immunoreactivity. An infection with the high-risk HPV types 16 and 18 could be detected in 39/92 tumor specimens (42%). Follow-up data were obtained from 99 patients within a range of 2 to 112 months. No dependence of overall survival on the presence of p53 gene mutations or HPV infection could be observed. The absence of statistically significant correlations between p53 gene mutation and progressive disease, however, does not deny its putative relevance in early phases of tumor development.
2055224217	Abstract Two strains of simian immunodeficiency viruses (SIV) isolated from chimpanzees (SIV CPZ-GAB and SIV CPZ-GAB2 ) originating from Gabon have previously been genetically characterized and shown to belong phylogenetically to the same lineage as the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). We describe the sequence analysis of a third HIV-1-related virus, SIV CPZ-ANT , isolated from a wild captured chimpanzee originating from Zaire. This virus displayed the same genetic organization as HIV-1 and was found to fall on the same lineage as HIV-1 and SIV CPZ-GAB . Protein sequence identity with SIV CPZ-GAB ranged from 72% (Pol) to 48% (Env) for the structural proteins, while a particularly divergent Vpu was found (only 25% identity to SIV CPZ-GAB ). The V3 regions of the SIV CPZ isolates were exceptionally conserved in contrast to the high divergence of V3 among HIV-1 isolates. However, SIV CPZ-ANT did not show a greater degree of sequence similarity with SIV CPZ-GAB than with HIV-1 isolates and represents a quite divergent outgroup of the HIV-1 lineage. Our data suggest multiple introductions of HIV-1 in the human population and shed new light on the origin of the HIV-1 pandemic.
2055224219	Toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 (TSST-1) and staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) A, B, and C were studied on binding to rabbit spleen cells. The toxins showed remarkable mitogenic effects on the cells. Among them, SEA and TSST-1 had much stronger mitogenic activities than SEB and SEC. Binding study showed that labeled TSST-1 and SEA bound considerably to cells, but that labeled SEB or SEC was not observed to bind at a detectable level under the same conditions as TSST-1 and SEA. Competitive binding analysis between toxins to cells proved that TSST-1 and SEA clearly competed with each other in binding. Scatchard plots for TSST-1 and SEA in binding were linear at the doses used. The Scatchard analysis for TSST-1 and SEA gave a dissociation constant of 2.5 X 10(-9) M and 7.6 X 10(-8) M and the number of binding sites per cell of 5.3 X 10(3) and 1.0 X 10(5), respectively.
2055224244	Proceedings: AACR Annual Meeting 2014; April 5-9, 2014; San Diego, CAThe considerable variability within tissue microenvironments as well as the multiclonality of cancers leads to heterogeneity within tumors, increasing the probablility of cellular states that promote resistance to therapy and eventually lead to reconstitution of the tumor by treatment-resistant cancer cells, which in some case have properties of normal tissue stem cells. Wnt signals are important in the maintenance of stem cells in various epithelial tissues, including in lung development and regeneration. We hypothesized that Wnt signals would also contribute to hierarchial organization of KrasG12D and KrasG12D; tp53Δ/Δ mouse lung adenocarcinomas. Indeed, rare cells with nuclear βeta-catenin were detected in mouse tumors in vivo. Stimulating KP mouse lung adenocarcinoma cells with recombinant Wnt3a promoted their spheroid-forming ability in a 3-dimensional Matrigel culture system, whereas RNAi or small-molecule inhibitors targeting Porcupine, an enzyme required for post-translational palmitoylation of Wnt, suppressed tumor initiation in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, either the stimulation or inhibition of the Wnt signaling pathway had no effect on growth of KP lung cancer cells in standard 2-dimensional cell culture, suggesting that Wnt signaling qualitatively modulates the cellular phenotype instead of controlling cell proliferation. We propose that targeting the Wnt signaling pathway can stimulate re-differentiation of lung adenocarcinoma cells, which may render them more sensitive to conventional anti-tumor therapies.Citation Format: Tuomas Tammela, Natanya Kerper, Wen Xue, Nikhil Joshi, Pekka Katajisto, Tyler Jacks.

2055224253	Crocin, the main pigment of Crocus sativus L., has been shown to have antiproliferative effects on cancer cells, but the involved mechanisms are only poor understood. This study focused on probable effect of crocin on the immortality of hepatic cancer cells. Cytotoxicity of crocin (IC50 3 mg/ml) in hepatocarcinoma HepG2 cells was determined after 48 h by neutral red uptake assay and MTT test. Immortality was investigated through quantification of relative telomerase activity with a quantitative real-time PCR-based telomerase repeat amplification protocol (qTRAP). Telomerase activity in 0.5 μg protein extract of HepG2 cells treated with 3 mg/ml crocin was reduced to about 51% as compared to untreated control cells. Two mechanisms of inhibition, i.e. interaction of crocin with telomeric quadruplex sequences and down regulation of hTERT expression, were examined using FRET analysis to measure melting temperature of a synthetic telomeric oligonucleotide in the presence of crocin and quantitative real-time RT-PCR, respectively. No significant changes were observed in the Tm telomeric oligonucleotides, while the relative expression level of the catalytic subunit of telomerase (hTERT) gene showed a 60% decrease as compared to untreated control cells. In conclusion, telomerase activity of HepG2 cells decreases after treatment with crocin, which is probably caused by down-regulation of the expression of the catalytic subunit of the enzyme.
2055224254	Subcellular structures of type II alveolar epithelial cells in the rat lung were analyzed at six evenly spaced times over 24 h (light period: 06.00 h–18.00 h), using a morphometric technique. The cell volumes were maximal at 16.00 h and minimal at 08.00 h. The volume and surface densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria were low during the light period, and high during the dark period. Morphometric parameters of multivesicular bodies did not significantly fluctuate over 24 h, but they increased from 04.00 h to 08.00 h. The volume densities of lamellar bodies increased from 16.00 h to 20.00 h, and decreased from 00.00 h to 08.00 h. The change in numerical densities of lamellar bodies was inversely correlated to that in the volume densities. As shown by electron microscopy, small lamellar bodies predominated at 08.00 h, larger lamellar bodies increasing at 16.00h. Composite bodies often appeared at 08.00 h and 12.00 h. Type II cells thus appear to fluctuate, showing three phases over 24 h: formation, accumulation and secretion of lamellar bodies. In particular, it is noteworthy that the accumulation stage occurs during the resting phase of the rat, whereas the secretion stage occurs during its body-active phase.
2055224266	Abstract The effect of nicotine on sea urchin eggs with and without jelly coats was examined. Sperm adhere irreversibly to the surface of nicotine-pretreated eggs, thus perhaps partly accounting for the increased probability of a successful spermegg interaction. The height of membrane elevation was considerably reduced by nicotine-pretreatment. This effect is probably of more importance as a symptom of the injurious effect of nicotine on the egg cortex than as indicating any direct influence on the block to polyspermy on the part of the membrane. Nicotine-pretreatment of sea urchin eggs often predetermines the failure of the cortical reaction on subsequent fertilization. Many eggs containing one or more sperm nuclei were found to be susceptible to polyspermy, largely by virtue of the partially fertilized character of their surfaces. Nicotine-pretreated eggs admit supernumerary sperm long after the block to polyspermy would have been complete in the controls. This was correlated with the facts that (1) the hyaline layer development was extremely poor even in completely fertilized nicotine-pretreated eggs, and (2) the hyaline layer has been suggested to play an important role in the establishment of the block to polyspermy.
2055224279	Previously we have shown that expression of a cloned human ribosomal protein gene,RPS14, depends upon regulatory sites located within the gene's proximal upstream DNA plus its first intron. In order to identifycis-active sequence motifs within theRPS14 promoter-enhancer complex, we transiently expressed a set of informative deletion clones in cultured Chinese hamster ovary cells. These experiments revealed three DNA sequence motifs that surround the S14 mRNA initiation site and are necessary for accurate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift, DNase I footprint, and methylation interference assays resolved two nuclear proteins, NFα-1 and NFβ-1, which bind specifically to these regulatory motifs. NF-α1 recognizes a pair of 6-bp target motifs (5′-TTCCGG-3′) that flank the 5′ end ofRPS14 exon I; and NF-β1 binds to a 10-bp target sequence (5′-CCGTGGGAAC-3′) within the gene's first intron. Site-directed deletion mutations within the NF-α1 and -β1 binding sites markedly inhibit S14 mRNA transcription.
2055224311	An investigation of the water requirements of tobacco grown during the dry season (July–December) in the coastal areas of north Queensland was undertaken at Clare during the years 1948 and 1949. There were eight spray treatments in 1948 and four in 1949. Total amount of water applied per acre varied from 8 to 27.5 in. The best results were obtained with 1.0–1.5 acre-in. of water for plant establishment in the field, followed by a total of approximately 20 acre-in. during growth. Heavy applications retarded early growth and tended to affect yield, but not quality, adversely. With low watering, plants were stunted and failed to ripen satisfactorily, whereas highest rates were above the optimum for yield and quality.

2055224338	T cell-mediated allergy to Ni++ is one of the most common forms of allergic contact dermatitis, but how the T-cell receptor (TCR) recognizes Ni++ is unknown. We studied a TCR from an allergic patient that recognizes Ni++ bound to the MHCII molecule DR52c containing an unknown self-peptide. We identified mimotope peptides that can replace both the self-peptide and Ni++ in this ligand. They share a p7 lysine whose eNH2 group is surface-exposed when bound to DR52c. Whereas the TCR uses germ-line complementary-determining region (CDR)1/2 amino acids to dock in the conventional diagonal mode on the mimotope–DR52c complex, the interface is dominated by the TCR Vβ CDR3 interaction with the p7 lysine. Mutations in the TCR CDR loops have similar effects on the T-cell response to either the mimotope or Ni++ ligand. We suggest that the mimotope p7 lysine mimics Ni++ in the natural TCR ligand and that MHCII β-chain flexibility in the area around the peptide p7 position forms a common site for cation binding in metal allergies.
2055224414	Abstract Adrenalectomy sensitizes laboratory animals to the pyrogenic and behavioural effects of proinflammatory cytokines. To determine whether these effects are mediated by central sites of action of glucocorticoids, interleukin-1 β was injected intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) in adrenalectomized mice with or without corticosterone supplementation and in mice pretreated i.c.v. with the glucocorticoid II receptor antagonist RU38486. Adrenalectomized mice were more sensitive to the depressing effects of i.c.v. IL-1 β on body temperature and social exploration than sham-operated mice. Corticosterone supplementation reversed the increased sensitivity to the low (300 pg/mouse) but not to the high dose (900 pg/mouse) of IL-1 β. Central administration of RU38486 (0.5 – 1 μg/mouse) mimicked the effects of adrenalectomy on behaviour but not on body temperature. These results suggest that endogenous glucocorticoids released in response to IL-1 β act in the brain to modulate the sensitivity of the cellular targets of this cytokine.
2055224520	Two high yielding semi-dwarf rice varieties namely IR-36 and Jaya, and one traditional tall indica rice variety, Akul, were cultivated in the dry and wet seasons, respectively, in 1987 under irrigated field conditions. A few days after visible panicle initiation, the panicle on the main shoot was dissected out to measure development, growth, soluble carbohydrates, amino acid and phosphate contents of individual primary branches. Primary branch developmnent was quantified by noting the average time to anthesis of spikelets on the branch. The pattern of development was hierarchical with each successive branch dominating the one immediately below it and hence, the measure of development increased in an acropetal fashion from the bottom to the top in all varieties. However, in comparison to the developmentally advanced distal branches, the branches at the proximal region had the potential to generate larger numbers of spikelets, although actual potential to produce grains in them was quite poor. Almost 2 weeks prior to mean anthesis, the gradient in assimilate concentration of the primary branches was found to increase acropetally from bottom to top and correlated negatively with the developmental score (high score indicates less development and vice versa). During the following week, the situation reversed and a higher concentration of assimilates was found in the lower branches than in the upper. Subsequent observations taken before mean anthesis showed assimilate contents to be correlated positively with the developmental score. The role of assimilates in spikelet development on the primary branches has been discussed and it is concluded that there is no clear causative relationship between assimilate concentration and spikelet development. In the post anthesis period, little difference in assimilate concentration of the branches was observed. The presence of a higher concentration of assimilates did not help spikelet survival on the proximal branches any more than that on the distal.
2055224521	Microcystin-LR (MC-LR) is a potent heptapeptide hepatotoxin at high doses, but its underlying mechanism of promoting liver cell proliferation at low doses is unclear. The transcription factor nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nr12) is key in mediating the protective antioxidant response against various environmental toxicants, but emerging data suggest that constitutive activation of Nrf2 contributes to a malignant phenotype. The purpose of this study was to characterize the interactions and effects of NrI2 activation on cell proliferation induced by MC-LR treatment. Treatment of HepG2 and Flep3B cells with MC-LR resulted in significant increases in Nrf2-ARE binding activities in the nuclear fractions and upregulation of its downstream genes HO-1 and NQO1. A possible mechanism may be that MC-LR binds to the cytosolic regulator protein Keap1 to liberate Nrf2. Nrf2 knockdown inhibited MC-LR-induced cell proliferation and cell cycle progression. Together, these results indicate that MC-LR-induced upregulation of Nrf2 in cancer cells promotes liver cancer cell growth and suggest a positive role of Nrf2 in tumorigenesis.
2055224641	CD2-associated protein (CD2AP) is an adapter protein that is involved in various signaling and vesicular trafficking processes and also functions as a linker between plasma membrane proteins and the actin cytoskeleton. The protein is known to have important functions in T cells and glomerular podocytes, but it is also expressed by many other adult-type tissues and cells. Here we analyzed the expression of the protein during early embryonic development and organogenesis of the mouse. The results showed differential tissue-specific regulation of CD2AP in developing and maturing organs. In oocytes and pre-implantation embryos, CD2AP was located diffusely in the cytoplasm, whereas in late blastocysts it was concentrated to the intercellular contacts. During organogenesis, CD2AP was distinctly upregulated upon, e.g., the pretubular aggregation of metanephric mesenchyme cells and the appearance of the osteoblastic rim around cartilages during endochondral ossification. High CD2AP expression was also observed during epithelial-like conversion of some highly specialized secretory cell types such as the odontoblasts, the cells of the choroid plexus and the decidualized cells of the endometrial stroma. In other instances, such as the development of the proximal tubuli of the kidney and the flat alveolar epithelium of the lung, the protein was downregulated upon differentiation and maturation of the cells. Finally, certain cells, e.g., glomerular podocytes, those forming the collecting ducts of the kidney, and the urothelium of the kidney pelvis, expressed CD2AP throughout their differentiation and maturation. Multiple molecules and complex pathways regulate embryogenesis, and scaffolding proteins apparently have pivotal roles in targeting and finetuning, e.g., growth factor- or hormone-induced processes. The cell-type specific spatio-temporal regulation of CD2AP during development suggests that this adapter protein is a key regulatory partner in many signaling pathways and cellular processes governing differentiation and morphogenesis.
2055224662	The volume-regulated anion channel (VRAC) plays a pivotal role in cell volume regulation in essentially all cell types studied. Additionally, VRAC appears to contribute importantly to a wide range of other cellular functions and pathological events, including cell motility, cell proliferation, apoptosis and excitotoxic glutamate release in stroke. Although biophysically, pharmacologically and functionally thoroughly described, VRAC has until very recently remained a genetic orphan. The search for the molecular identity of VRAC has been long and has yielded multiple potential candidates, all of which eventually turned out to have properties not fully compatible with those of VRAC. Recently, two groups have independently identified the protein leucine-rich repeats containing 8A (LRRC8A), belonging to family of proteins (LRRC8A–E) distantly related to pannexins, as the likely pore-forming subunit of VRAC. In this brief review, we summarize the history of the discovery of VRAC, outline its basic biophysical and pharmacological properties, link these to several cellular functions in which VRAC appears to play important roles, and sketch the amazing search for the molecular identity of this channel. Finally, we describe properties of the LRRC8 proteins, highlight some features of the LRRC8A knockout mouse and discuss the impact of the discovery of LRRC8 as VRAC on future research.
2055224696	Summary During 40 years of active research, G. Righi published 85 papers on earthworm taxonomy, 5 on earthworm physiology, 5 on earthworm ecology and 3 on earthworm biogeography. In addition he published 16 papers on microdrile oligochaetes, and 17 on other groups (mainly crustaceans and molluscs). Most of his megadrile taxonomical papers related to Brazilian earthworms, although he also studied earthworms from other South and Central American countries (Colombia, Venezuela, Argentina, Ecuador, Peru, Bolivia, Mexico, Belize, Costa Rica,) and some Lower Antilles. G. Righi described one family, 25 genera and 224 species, mainly from Brazil (139 spp. in 16 genera), Colombia (36 spp., 5 genera) and Venezuela (24 spp., 2 genera). The majority of these new taxa belong to the Family Glossoscolecidae (161 spp, 14 genera). Analysis of the taxonomic production of G. Righi reveals a description rate of 6.4 species per year. This paper discusses the possibility of a complete worldwide species inventory, considering Righi's rate of new species description.
2055224704	In field studies in the Russian Far East, five types of illuminating devices were evaluated for attracting adult gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.), pink gypsy moth, L. mathura Moore, and nun moth, L. monacha (L.). Our objective was to determine if light from commercial lamps suited to out-of-doors floodlighting could be modified to reduce their attractiveness to moths without a reduction of illumination. During 17 nights of tests, fluorescent blacklight lamps captured significantly more adults than either phosphor mercury or highpressure sodium lamps. Captures were slightly higher for phosphor mercury than high-pressure sodium lamps but both were unattractive to all three lymantriids after the addition of filters that blocked spectral emissions
2055224762	Silane-coated silica particles (PureSperm) were evaluated as an alternative to Percoll for gradient separation of spermatozoa, for use in assisted reproduction. Recovery of motile and morphologically normal spermatozoa after using a four-layer Percoll and a two- and four-layer PureSperm gradient respectively was recorded. In-vitro fertilization (IVF) results after using PureSperm for the sperm preparation were also evaluated. No difference in sperm recovery or sperm motility was found when comparing the use of Percoll and the four-layer gradient of PureSperm. When using a two-layer PureSperm gradient, motility was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) compared to Percoll. Normal sperm morphology increased from 8-17.2% after using Percoll and to 12.7% and 11.4% after using a four-layer and a two-layer PureSperm gradient respectively. All gradient preparations showed a significant decrease in the teratozoospermia index compared to the ejaculate (P < 0.01). No significant differences in IVF results regarding fertilization and pregnancy rates were found when PureSperm or the swim-up technique were used for the sperm preparation. PureSperm seems to be an acceptable alternative to Percoll but although the percentage of sperm recovery was higher after PureSperm we still recommend the swim-up technique to be the first choice, as a higher percentage of progressive motile spermatozoa is obtained without using other chemicals than IVF culture medium.
2055224764	Effects of temperature rise (from 0 to +5°C) and salinity decline (from 34 to 30 psu) on vital biological functions of the Antarctic isopod Serolis polita were studied in laboratory experiments. Behavioural reactions to food odour, as well as righting responses and reburying in the sediments, were measured. Both temperature increase and salinity decline impaired the ability of S. polita to perform these biological functions critical for their long-term survival, by lowering the number of isopods able to right and rebury in the sediment, increasing time-to-right, reducing locomotory activity and weakening isopod reaction to food odour. Significant interactive effects between temperature and salinity on time-to-right and time spent swimming were observed, with isopods being more vulnerable to lower salinities when exposed to higher temperatures. Some biological functions (righting, reburying) were more sensitive to temperature and salinity changes than others (swimming). In conclusion, our findings strongly suggest that Antarctic isopods are vulnerable to environmental changes, and their ability to cope with them is limited.
2055224779	Abstract Susceptibility to Chagas disease infections and its clinical manifestations may be influenced by host genetic factors. Among cytokines, the multifunctional transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFβ1), plays a major role in the establishment and pathogenesis of Trypanosoma cruzi infection, the etiological agent of Chagas disease. Several single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the TGFβ1 gene that may affect cytokine production have been described. We investigated, by PCR methods, five SNP in the TGFβ1 gene of known or suggested functional significance (−988 C/A; −800 G/A; −509 C/T; 10 T/C and 263 C/T) in 347 seropositive (asymptomatic, n  = 175; cardiomyopathic, n  = 172) and 279 seronegative unrelated individuals from a Peruvian and a Colombian population where T. cruzi is highly endemic. We found a significant difference in the distribution of the TGFβ1 10T and 10C alleles between patients and healthy controls in both cohorts, analyzed independently and combined. The frequency of the high TGFβ1 producer genotype 10 C/C was increased in the patients groups of both populations. Our data suggests that TGFβ1 genetic polymorphisms at codon 10 may be involved in a differential susceptibility to T. cruzi infection in these South American samples.
2055224814	Aqueous solutions of indole acetic acid, kinetin, gibberellic acid and abscisic acid were applied singly and in combination to the decapitated stem stump of Phaseolus seedlings. Application of indole acetic acid will not completely replace the intact stem apex with regard to the inhibition of lateral bud extension. The greatest inhibition of bud growth is obtained when indole acetic acid is applied in combination with both kinetin and abscisic acid. Treatment with gibberellic acid causes massive bud growth even in the presence of indole acetic acid, kinetin and abscisic acid. Although both abscisic acid and kinetin have only a slight promoting effect on bud outgrowth when applied singly, these hormones will modify the effects of indole acetic acid and gibberellic acid.
2055224823	Macrophages and neutrophils play a decisive role in host responses to intracellular bacteria including the agent of tuberculosis (TB), Mycobacterium tuberculosis as they represent the forefront of innate immune defense against bacterial invaders. At the same time, these phagocytes are also primary targets of intracellular bacteria to be abused as host cells. Their efficacy to contain and eliminate intracellular M. tuberculosis decides whether a patient initially becomes infected or not. However, when the infection becomes chronic or even latent (as in the case of TB) despite development of specific immune activation, phagocytes have also important effector functions. Macrophages have evolved a myriad of defense strategies to combat infection with intracellular bacteria such as M. tuberculosis. These include induction of toxic anti-microbial effectors such as nitric oxide and reactive oxygen intermediates, the stimulation of microbe intoxication mechanisms via acidification or metal accumulation in the phagolysosome, the restriction of the microbe's access to essential nutrients such as iron, fatty acids, or amino acids, the production of anti-microbial peptides and cytokines, along with induction of autophagy and efferocytosis to eliminate the pathogen. On the other hand, M. tuberculosis, as a prime example of a well-adapted facultative intracellular bacterium, has learned during evolution to counter-balance the host's immune defense strategies to secure survival or multiplication within this otherwise hostile environment. This review provides an overview of innate immune defense of macrophages directed against intracellular bacteria with a focus on M. tuberculosis. Gaining more insights and knowledge into this complex network of host-pathogen interaction will identify novel target sites of intervention to successfully clear infection at a time of rapidly emerging multi-resistance of M. tuberculosis against conventional antibiotics.
2055224842	Purpose: To report a case of Fusarium species invasion of a methafilcon matrix soft contact lens in a first-time lens wearer. Results: The authors describe the history and ocular examination of a 19-year-old woman with large fungal deposits on her contact lens. Culture of the contact lens grew Fusarium species. On histologic examination, fungal filaments were seen on both surfaces of the contact lens as well as invading the lens matrix. The fungal morphology changed as the fungus penetrated the contact lens. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first documented case of fungal invasion of a methafilcon matrix lens and the second histologically documented case of Fusarium invasion of a contact lens.
2055224886	When Xenopus embryos from mid-tailbud to early tadpole stages were exposed to retinoic acid (RA), the gut developed with an uncoiled, straight intestinal tube, morphogenesis of the liver and stomach was affected and intestinal epithelial cells developed without a brush border and alkaline phosphatase activity. However, the temporal and spatial expression pattern of XlHbox 8, the only homeobox gene expressed in the endoderm was unaffected. In lateral plate mesodermal cells the expression of α-smooth muscle (SM) actin was delayed. A similar syndrome has been reported in a study of embryos lacking functional FGF receptors in which it was proposed that the uncoiled intestinal tube and the delayed differentiation of the intestinal muscle cells are causally related. Our results support this proposition and further suggest that mesenchymal-epithelial interactions concerned with regional specification of the endoderm may be impaired resulting in other defects in the gut.
2055224945	Abstract Acetylglucosaminidase, amylase, cellobiase and maltase are more active in anterior midgut cells, whereas aminopeptidase, carboxypeptidase and trypsin are more active in posterior midgut cells of Tenebrio molitor larvae. Differential centrifugation of midgut homogenates prepared in saline (or mannitol) isotonic buffered solutions revealed that aminopeptidase is associated with membranes, which occur in subcellular fractions displaying many microvilli. Carboxypeptidase, trypsin and the carbohydrases are mostly found in the soluble fraction, although significant amounts sediment together with cell vesicles. Data on differential calcium precipitation of midgut homogenates and on partial ultrasound disruption of midgut tissue suggest that aminopeptidase is a microvillar enzyme and that the digestive enzymes recovered in the soluble fraction of cells are loosely bound to the cell glycocalyx. About 5% of the non-absorbable dye amaranth fed to T. molitor larvae remains in the midgut tissue after rinsing. Most dye was recovered in the soluble fraction of midgut cells. This provided further support for the hypothesis that the digestive enzymes found in the soluble fraction are actually extracellular and that the true intracellular enzymes are those associated with cell vesicles. The results suggest that the carbohydrases are secreted by exocytosis from the anterior midgut and carboxypeptidase and trypsin from the posterior midgut.
2055224981	Using immunohistochemical detection of the Fos protein as a cellular marker of neuronal activation, we examined forebrain areas that may be activated upon chemical stimulation of the laryngeal opening. Anesthetized rats were subject to multiple infusions of a chemical solution into the laryngopharynx. These animals were compared to two control groups: a surgical control group in which the animals were subject to the surgical procedure but received no stimulus infusions and a flow control group in which physiological saline replaced the chemical stimulus. Comparing the numbers of Fos-like-immunoreactive neurons in regions of the forebrain across groups revealed that infusing the chemical stimulus solution into the laryngopharyngeal opening selectively increased the number of Fos-like-immunoreactive nuclei in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus and the central nucleus of the amygdala, two autonomic-visceral related forebrain regions. Within the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, Fos-like-immunoreactive nuclei were significantly increased in the parvocellular subdivision while in the central nucleus of the amygdala, significant increases in Fos-like-immunoreactive nuclei were limited to the lateral capsular subdivision. These data suggest that in the rat laryngopharyngeal chemosensory stimulation activates forebrain regions that receive oral sensory information and are involved in visceral and autonomic functions.
2055224985	Background Vibrio cholerae is the causative agent of cholera. Extensive studies reveal that complicated regulatory cascades regulate expression of virulence genes, the products of which are required for V. cholerae to colonize and cause disease. In this study, we investigated the expression of the key virulence regulator ToxR under different conditions.
2055225001	An intertidal population of the fissiparous sea star Coscinasteriastenuispina (Lamarck, 1816) was sampled over a 1 year period at Ponta de Itaipu, Niteroi, Rio de Janeiro. Gonadal indices revealed an annual reproductive cycle. Spawning occurred in the late winter and early spring between August and November. Pyloric caecal indices did not show a clear annual cycle or a reciprocal relationship with gonadal indices. The population appears to be sustained only by fission, as only males were found. Fission occurred throughout the year, but was most frequent in the winter (July, August and September). Incidence of fission was correlated with the occurrence of the extremely low tides during daytime that exposes many specimens to air. Austral winter tides are low by day and high by night, while the austral summer tides are low by night and high by day. The most extreme annual deviation in seawater temperature is about 5°C. Larval recruitment seems to be negligible, since very small individuals were not found.
2055225007	Pecan scab, caused by the fungus Fusicladium effusum (syn. Cladosporium caryigenum and Fusicladosporium effusum), is the most devastating disease of the commercial pecan (Carya illinoinensis) production in Southeastern United States. Disease control depends primarily on multiple applications of fungicides per season. Fungicides available for scab control include those in the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) group. QoI fungicides have a high level of resistance risk and in vitro sensitivity assays are essential to monitor development of resistance in populations of F. effusum. In vitro assays were conducted to determine sensitivity of F. effusum to the QoI fungicide azoxystrobin. In vitro assays were conducted with and without the addition of salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) to inhibit alternative oxidase (AOX) and eliminate the rescue impact of AOX on fungal respiration in the presence of QoI fungicides. When 0.653 mM SHAM was added to the medium, growth of a majority of the isolates was significantly reduced, even in the absence of fungicide. Of the 89 isolates tested, only 21 showed a dose response to azoxystrobin. Growth of the other 68 isolates was insufficient to measure a dose response. Only 18 isolates showed a clear dose response to azoxystrobin both with and without SHAM, but the calculated EC50 values were significantly different (P < 0.0001). Further experiments were performed to investigate the effects of different concentrations of SHAM and another AOX inhibitor, propyl gallate (PG) on hyphal growth derived from mycelial fragments of F. effusum in liquid medium in microtiter plates and hyphal growth derived from germinated conidia on solid medium in the absence of fungicide. Even at the lowest concentrations tested, both SHAM and PG (0.01 and 0.25 mM, respectively) inhibited hyphal growth of F. effusum in liquid medium and on solid medium. These results suggest the role of AOX and possible auxiliary toxicity of these inhibitors in F. effusum physiology. Due to the toxic effects of these AOX inhibitors on F. effusum in vitro, future sensitivity profiling for QoIs will be performed without the addition of these inhibitors.
2055225014	The aroma volatiles, and in particular the glucosinolate products, of seedlings grown from authenticated Lepidium sativum seeds are compared with those from purchased ‘garden cress’. Appreciable differences in the glucosinolate products can be observed showing that retailed ‘garden cress’ contains cruciferous seedlings in addition to, or in place of, L. sativum. Results are compared with a previous analysis of the volatile components of ‘garden cress’.
2055225078	The p-fluorophenylalanine (FPA) resistance of accphe, which has previously been shown (Brooks et al., 1972) to be a try-1 mutant, has been further investigated. When incubated in the absence of tyrosine, accphe and also tyr-1 auxotrophs show a gradual increase in free phenylalanine in the cell but a sharp decrease in FPA incorporation into protein. The decrease in FPA incorporation is apparently due to the excess phenylalanine in the mutants, since the normal endogenous pool component in wild type and also in the mutants incubated on tyrosine does not appear to compete with FPA for incorporation. The rate of FPA incorporation into protein in accphe remains at 10–15% of the wild-type rate even when the ratio of free FPA to excess phenylalanine in the cell is high as 8:1. If wild type is supplied with exogenous phenylalanine and FPA simultaneously, phenylalanine is preferentially incorporated into protein but, in contrast to the mutant, the rate of FPA incorporation increases as the ratio of free FPA to phenylalanine increases. On the basis of differences in competition with FPA and in susceptibilities to mild extraction procedures, it is proposed that phenylalanine can be located in at least three compartments in Neurospora: a small constant-size endogenous pool always seen in wild type; an expandable exogenous pool; and a protein synthesis pool which is preferentially populated by endogenous phenylalanine but can be entered by exogenous molecules when biosynthesis is regulated. In accphe, where phenylalanine biosynthesis is not regulated, the excess phenylalanine is located primarily in the protein synthesis pool where it only has to compete with a small FPA component and is thereby preferentially incorporated into protein in this mutant.
2055225086	The prognostic significance of IgH/Bcl2 rearrangement in follicular lymphoma (FL) remains contentious; polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methodology and tissue source variability may account for some inconsistencies. As IgH/Bcl2 major breakpoint region (MBR) sequences may be found in normal blood, an MBR+ result by conventional PCR in blood/bone marrow may not indicate FL. To establish tumour MBR status, 190 lymphoid tissue samples with histologically evident FL (and therefore >1% tumour cells) were examined by real-time quantifiable PCR; 50% (95/190) had clonal MBR IgH/Bcl2 (MBR was considered clonal when >1%). Overall survival (median = 11·5 years) of MBR+ and MBR? patients was not significantly different.
2055225091	In addition to courting females, male threespine sticklebacks must guard their nests from attacks on the eggs by female cannibals. We hypothesized that the presence of females in high densities in tide pools adversely affects a male's health and reproductive success. In the laboratory males housed with conspecific females during the breeding season were in poorer physical condition and died sooner than solitary males and males housed with conspecific males or with heterospecific females.
2055225106	Competition is often most intense between similar sized organisms that have similar ecological requirements. Many coral reef fish species settle preferentially to live coral at the end of their larval phase where they interact with other species that recruited to the same habitat patch at a similar time. Mortality is high and usually selective and individuals must compete for low risk space. This study examined the competitive interactions between two species of juvenile damselfish and the extent to which interactions that occurred within a recruitment cohort established the disjunct distribution patterns that were displayed in later life stages. Censuses and field experiments with juveniles found that one species, the ambon damsel, was dominant immediately after settlement and pushed the subordinate species higher up the reef and further from shelter. Presence of a competitor resulted in reduced growth for both species. Juvenile size was the best predictor of competitive success and outweighed the effects of short term prior residency. Size at settlement also dramatically influenced survival, with slightly larger individuals displaying higher aggression, pushing the subordinate species into higher risk habitats. While subordinates had higher feeding rates, they also sustained higher mortality. The study highlights the importance of interaction dynamics between species within a recruitment cohort to patterns of growth and distribution of species within communities.
2055225212	Canada goose droppings, collected in parks to which the public had access, were screened for a range of bacteria that could be pathogenic in man. Droppings of Canada geese, and other waterfowl, did contain such bacteria, including some that are well-known causes of illness in man. These bacteria, plus a species of Salmonella that was experimentally inoculated into droppings, were shown to survive and multiply in the droppings for up to one month after their deposition by geese. Canada geese ranged further from water than other waterfowl species and thus distributed their droppings over a larger area of park grassland. This more widespread distribution of their droppings leads Canada geese to pose a greater potential health risk than other waterfowl studied here, but variations in human responses to challenge with bacteria, and variations in human and waterfowl behaviour in public parks, renders quantification of this risk impossible.
2055225242	Abstract The mitochondrial H + -ATPase of the parasitic protozoan Trypanosoma brucei is shown to be developmentally regulated through the T. brucei life cycle as has been shown for components of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. We have substantiated our results by assaying not only for oligomycin-sensitive ATPase activity but also by determining the level of ATP synthetic activity. These results show that the level of ATPase present in the procyclic form of T. brucei is increased by at least threefold from that of the early bloodstream form while the ATPase activity in the late bloodstream form is only about twofold higher than the early form. ATP synthesis activity shows these same results. We have determined the level of ATP synthase protein present in the life cycle stages by Western analysis employing the antibodies that we have raised against both the water soluble F 1 and the membrane-associated F 0 moieties which we have purified from T. brucei . The Western blots of the procyclic form show strong reactivity with both the F 0 and F 1 antibodies. The other two life cycle stages, the early and the late bloodstream forms, show considerably less reactivity, paralleling the activity results. Electron micrographs of the sonicated mitochondrial fraction show inverted vesicles which are studded with knobby H + -ATPase in the procyclic form. The early bloodstream vesicles show very few of these characteristic structures, while the late bloodstream form shows a range of vesicles from nearly nude to partially studded.
2055225248	"The PA1b (Pea Albumin 1, subunit b) peptide is an entomotoxin extract from Legume seeds with lethal activity on several insect pests, such as mosquitoes, some aphids and cereal weevils. This 37 amino-acid cysteine-rich peptide has been, until now, obtained by biochemical purification or chemical synthesis. In this paper, we present our results for the transient production of the peptide in Nicotiana benthamiana by agro-infiltration, with a yield of about 35 µg/g of fresh leaves and maximum production 8 days after infiltration. PA1b is part of the PA1 gene which, after post-translational modifications, encodes two peptides (PA1b and PA1a). We show that transforming tobacco with the PA1b cDNA alone does not result in production of the toxin and, in fact, the entire cDNA is necessary, raising the question of the role of PA1a. We constructed a PA1-cassette, allowing for the quick ""cut/paste"" of different PA1b mutants within a conserved PA1 cDNA. This cassette enabled us to produce the six isoforms of PA1b which exist in pea seeds. Biological tests revealed that all the isoforms display similar activity, with the exception of one which is inactive. The lack of activity in this isoform led us to conclude that the amphiphilic nature of the peptide is necessary for activity. The possible applications of this expression system for other cysteine-rich biomolecules are discussed."
2055225277	Sf21 insect cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus containing cDNA for the entire coding region of the mouse growth hormone binding protein (mGHBP). Recombinant (r) mGHBP was expressed at a yield of 17.3 mg/liter/3 days. The molecular size (Mr) of the rmGHBP was approximately 33,000 as estimated by SDS–PAGE. Amino-terminal sequence analysis of the recombinant protein yielded two sequences: one identical to amino acids 1–15 and another corresponding to amino acids 14–21 of the GHR/GHBP. Western blot analysis revealed that this is the sameMras that of one of the two majorMrforms of serum mGHBP. Deglycosylation of serum mGHBP and recombinant mGHBP caused a shift in the molecular size of both proteins to that expected after removal of all N-linked carbohydrates. Binding characteristics of the recombinant mGHBP to mouse growth hormone were similar to those for serum GHBP. Scatchard analysis showed an equilibrium association constant (Ka) for rmGHBP of 3.8 × 108± 0.6 × 108M−1(mean ± SEM,n= 3) andKaof 9.2 × 108± 2.0 × 108M−1(mean ± SEM,n= 3) for the serum mGHBP. In conclusion, this expression system should allow a production of relatively large quantities of mGHBP suitable for physiological studies on the role of this protein.
2055225343	Background: The increased reports of ESBL dissemination from various centres in south western, Nigeria and the recent emergence of carbapenem resistant bacteria prompted the conception of this study. Objectives: To demonstrate the relationship between high molecular weight plasmids and the expression of antibiotic multi-resistance including ESBL and carbapenemase. Methods: We investigated 97 isolates of selected organisms consisting of 67 E. coli and 30 Klebseilla spp for the presence of plasmids expressing ESBL including carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes. Beta-lactamase was determined using acidometric method, while ESBL and carbapenemase activity was determined using the double-disk diffusion test as well as the Modified Hodge test (MHT). Plasmid profiles of ESBL and carbapenemase positive isolates were determined according to standard protocols. Results: An ESBL prevalence rate of 21.6% and carbapenem- resistance rate of 9.3% was recorded. Antibiotic susceptibility profile of ESBL isolates showed 100.0% resistance against Amoxicillin, Cotrimoxazole and Erythromycin. Moderate susceptibility was recorded against the Quinolone class of antibiotics; Meropenem remained the most active antibiotic against ESBL isolates with 62.5% against E. coli and 60% against K. pneumoniae. The plasmid profiles of our study isolates ranged from 11.8kbp to 35.5kbp. Conclusion: Due to the relationship between high molecular weight plasmids and multi-drug resistance, we hereby recommend regular molecular surveillance of this form in our study setting. Keywords: Carbapenem-resistance, ESBL isolates, Plasmid profile, Abeokuta African Health Sciences 2013; 13(4): 1091 - 1097
2055225368	Abstract The hybridization of rat liver DNA with complementary RNA has been studied using the membrane technique of Gillespie & Spiegelman (1965). Complementary RNA was synthesized in vitro using Micrococcus RNA polymerase and rat liver DNA. Hybridization was rather rapid, but only about 5% of the total DNA became involved in hybrid formation. The hybrid melted sharply with a mean temperature of 72 °C, only 3 deg. C lower than the mean melting temperature of enzymic DNA-RNA hybrid. RNA complementary to at least half of the total DNA was isolated from a 2:1 enzymic DNA-RNA hybrid. Only about 5% of the DNA hybridized with this complementary RNA under standard annealing conditions, showing that the limited hybridization of rat liver DNA is caused by factors other than limited complementarity of this RNA. It is suggested that the factor responsible is the extreme complexity of mammalian DNA. Mammalian DNA is known to contain a minor fraction which, following denaturation, renatures rapidly compared with the bulk of the DNA. Renaturing rat liver DNA reduced its capacity to hybridize with complementary RNA by two-thirds, showing that it is the rapidly renaturing DNA fraction which hybridizes with the RNA. In confirmation of this, when the rapidly renaturing and slowly renaturing DNA fractions were separated by differential adsorption to hydroxylapatite at 70 °C, preferential hybridization of complementary RNA to the rapidly renaturing DNA fraction was observed. Liver nuclear RNA competed completely against the hybridization of complementary RNA with rat liver DNA. DNA-like RNA from liver, kidney, spleen and brain all competed strongly against complementary RNA. It is concluded that the hybridization of DNA and RNA from higher organisms under the usual conditions permits mainly or only the hybridization of the minor DNA fraction which renatures rapidly. RNA complementary to most of this DMA fraction is found in several different tissues.
2055225392	Abstract MHC-G is a class Ib (non-classical) major histocompatibility complex (MHC) whose functional and evolutionary characteristics are still under scrutiny. The study of noncoding sequences in the MHC genes may provide important phylogenetic information. In this work we have sequenced the MHC-G exon 8, which encodes for the 3′UT region, in different species of primates. It has been shown that: (1) a previously described 14 base pair (bp) deletion polymorphism is human-specific and the HLA-G alleles may be classified according to its absence or presence; (2) another newly described 3 bp deletion/insertion polymorphism is also human-specific; and (3) another newly described 51 bp deletion polymorphism is common to Pongidae and humans, but is not found in other primates belonging to the Cercopithecinae family. A hypothesis on the evolutionary pathway of this gene is put forward in the light of these findings.
2055225412	Intelectin is a newly characterized gene family involved in early embryogenesis, host-pathogen interactions and iron metabolism. In this study, we searched the genomes of metazoans by extensive BLAST survey and found no intelectin homologs in invertebrate metazoans but 12 in amphioxus Branchiostoma floridae and 21 in ascidians Ciona intestinalis. Some ascidians oocyte cortical granule lectins (CGLs) have unknown insertion sequences between fibrinogen-related domain (FReD) and Intelectin Domain, the boundaries of which are equivalent to exon structures. In addition to ascidians intelectins/CGLs located in the base, phylogenetic tree comprises four main clades representing mammal, frog, fish, and amphioxus, indicating that intelectin genes undergo extensive lineage-specific duplication or gene conversion. However, genomic neighborhood surrounding analysis shows that clear proto-orthologies are difficult to be established among these counterparts. In addition, sequence comparison and phylogenetic analysis of FReDs from intelectins and other fibrinogen-like proteins from choanoflagellate, anemone, frog and human indicate FReDs of intelectins are unique. Likewise, these choanoflagellate and anemone genes may be close to intelectin gene.
2055225460	Newly discovered Homo remains, stone artifacts, and animal fossils from Dmanisi, Republic of Georgia, provide a basis for better understanding patterns of hominin evolution and behavior in Eurasia ca. 1.77 million years ago. Here we describe a fourth skull that is nearly complete, lacking all but one of its teeth at the time of death. Both the maxillae and the mandible exhibit extensive bone loss due to resorption. This individual is similar to others from the site but supplies information about variation in brain size and craniofacial anatomy within the Dmanisi paleodeme. Although this assemblage presents numerous primitive characters, the Dmanisi skulls are best accommodated within the species H. erectus. On anatomical grounds, it is argued that the relatively small-brained and lightly built Dmanisi hominins may be ancestral to African and Far Eastern branches of H. erectus showing more derived morphology.
2055225488	The research work on selenium in soils, plants and animals is of recent origin in India. Since milch cattle suffer due to selenium deficiency or toxicity through fodder, a systematic study of selenium was undertaken. Though research work on selenium in soil, plants and animal system was started a decade ago, the findings are significant and are critically reviewed in this paper.
2055225505	Over 100 bacterial cultures isolated from ovine rumen contents by enrichment techniques in polysaccharide-containing media were examined for the ability to degrade plant cell wall structural polysaccharides. Approximately two-thirds of the isolates retained were Gram negative and amongst the coccoid isolates diplococci predominated. Many of the rods examined were piliated and/or flagellated. Thirty of the more active xylan- and arabinan-degrading isolates were examined for both the production and activity of the principal polysaccharidase and glycosidase enzymes associated with plant cell wall polysaccharide hydrolysis, following culture in a hemicellulose containing growth medium. The wide range of glycosidase activities detected in these hemicellulolytic isolates was evidence for their role in the breakdown of dietary polysaccharides in the rumen.
2055225526	Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is a common malignant tumor in salivary glands. Unfortunately, current treatment modalities which include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy have limited success rates. To develop new treatment strategies we hypothesized that a cancer-specific apoptotic ligand driven by a tumor specific promoter would specifically induce apoptosis in ACC. To test this concept, we selected tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) and the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter. The latter is highly active in 85% of human cancer cells while it is mostly inactive in somatic cells. Using immunohistochemistry we confirmed that ACC samples but not normal salivary cells were positive for hTERT. Similar results were also seen in an ACC cell line, SACC-83. We then constructed first generation Ad5 vectors which used the hTERT promoter to drive TRAIL (AdTERT-TRAIL). Transduction of SACC-83, but not of control human embryo-fibrocyte lung (HEL) cells, led to apoptosis as measured by MTT assay and flow cytomerty. We used the SACC-83 cells for a subcutaneous tumor model in vivo. Intratumoral injections of AdTERT-TRAIL (5 x 109 particles/tumor) but not of AdTERT-EGFP or PBS resulted in significant (p < 0.01) reduction in tumor sizes, which demonstrated that the human TRAIL driven by tumor-specific promoter could efficiently induce apoptosis in SACC-83 cells in vitro and in vivo. These results suggest that a novel gene therapy strategy can also be used in the treatment of ACC in the near future.
2055225553	NONINVASIVE photolytic injury to targeted neuronal subpopulations in vivo causes unique, slowly progressive neuronal degeneration. To examine the mechanisms of degeneration toward development and transplantation studies, cytosolic calcium levels were measured in vitro from neocortical neurons after incorporation of photoactive nanospheres and laser-activated singlet oxygen production within lysosomes. Cytosolic calcium increased irreversibly, predominantly from extracellular sources through channel-mediated mechanisms and increased membrane porosity. Propidium iodide studies demonstrated gradual loss of membrane integrity over hours to days. The calcium channel blocker nimodipine, or calcium-free medium, partially protected neurons from calcium flux and cell death. Results suggest calcium-dependent and independent mechanisms of neuronal degeneration following singlet oxygen production.
2055225608	Association between the NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) gene 609 C>T polymorphism and esophageal cancer (EC) has been widely evaluated; however, the results are often irreproducible. We thus aimed to comprehensively evaluate this association through a meta-analysis. Data were extracted from 10 study populations involving 1390 EC patients and 1812 controls, and were analyzed using STATA software. Random-effects model was applied irrespective of between-study heterogeneity, which was assessed by the inconsistency index (I2) statistic. Publication bias was weighted by the funnel plot and Egger's test. Genotype distributions of the NQO1 gene 609 C>T polymorphism met Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium in controls for all studies. Allelic comparison indicated that NQO1 609 T allele conferred an increased risk (odds ratio [OR]=1.23; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02–1.49; p=0.035), accompanying significant heterogeneity (I2=63.4%, p=0.003) and no publication bias (pEgger=0.391). This association was potentiall...
2055225743	Cues leading to activity in L. scabra scabra in the Patonga Creek mangrove swamp, New South Wales, were investigated. Experimental stimulation with fresh water and sea water caused activity in a short time, as also did physical disturbance, but increased relative humidity had no effect. As most of the L. scabra scabra population occurred above the extreme high water of spring tides it could not have been stimulated to activity by tidal immersion. It is concluded that rain and dew are the major natural cues leading to activity.
2055225744	Data on patterns of systematic and ocassional hunting of birds, mammals, reptiles, mollusks and insects by Stumptail macaques are reported for a period of ten months. Systematic hunting of water snails, terrestrial spiders, and land worms was conducted by all age classes, except infants, and both sexes. Of the occasional hunting of birds, large lizards, large frogs, and field mice, the adult females conducted 70%, the adult males 12%, the two year old females 12%, and the two year old males 6%. The differences between males and females were statistically significant (.05 confidence level). Females dominated the hunt and were more interested in meateating than the males. This contrasts strikingly with the data reported for baboons and chimpanzees in which the males dominate the hunt. Of all the prey hunted ocassionally, 76% was shared. The differences between shared and not sared prey were statistically significant (.05 confidence level). All age classes, including infants, participated in meat-sharing. Three types of meat-sharing are described: mother-offspring, hunter-close-friend, and piece-dropping. The prey was shared with genetic relatives, and with close and sistant friends in this order. Pearson’s correlation coeficients between rank of hunter and number of hunts and between rank of hunter and number of individuals with whom the prey was shared yielded +.866 and +.890 respectively. Meat-sharing seems to be similar to that observed for baboons but some differences exist between baboons and chimpanzees on the one hand and Stumptails on the other. Dominance relations in our Stumptails seem to act as the context determining the direction and the type of sharing. An increase in hunting activity during the study period is suggested to be the result of the prey’s migratory and breeding patterns, of environmental changes, and of the high activity scores and physiological states of the adult-females in the troop. Although not hunted, reactions to snakes, iguanas, scorpions, and gulls are also described.
2055225770	Iodination of Escherichia coli ribosomal protein L18 inactivated the 5 S RNA binding activity of the protein. Complete activity loss occurred at a 4-fold molar excess of iodine to L18. Tyrosine was found to be the reactive amino acid. L18, prebound to 5 S RNA, was inactivated at a much slower rate than unbound L18. Treatment of L18 with tetranitromethane also resulted in an inactivation of the protein. However, much larger amounts of tetranitromethane, compared to iodine, were necessary to achieve inactivation (50% activity loss at a 600-fold molar excess of tetranitromethane to L18).
2055225788	Abstract Pan-neurotrophin 1 (PNT-1) is a synthetic trophic factor engineered by combining active domains of the neurotrophins nerve growth factor (NGF), brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and neurotrophin 3 (NT-3) into an NT-3 backbone. This molecule was produced in transiently transfected COS cells or in baculovirus-infected insect cells transfected COS cells or in baculovirus-infected insect cells and subsequently purified to homogeneity. Saturation binding in embryonic spinal sensory neurons demonstrated a greater number of high-affinity binding sites for PNT-1 than for its parental molecule NT-3. PNT-1 was shown to efficiently block the chemical crosslinking of NGF, BDNF, and NT-3 to their cognate Trk receptors and to the low-affintiy NGF receptor expressed on neuronal and nonneuronal cells. PNT-1 stimulated survival and proliferation of MG87 fibroblasts expressing either TrkA, TrkB, or TrkC. PNT-1 also promoted survival of a greater number of embryonic dorsal root ganglion neurons than any of the other neurotrophins alone, and its effects were equivalent to a combination of NGF, BDNF, and NT-3. Analysis of receptor-specific neurotrophic activities demonstrated that PNT-1 efficiently rescued TrkA mRNA-containing sympathetic neurons and TrkB and TrkC mRNA-containing sensory neurons from the dorsal root and nodose ganglia. Finally, PNT-1 showed robust retrograde transport to DRG neurons in vivo after injection into the sciatic nerve. Radiolabeled PNT-1 accumulated in small-, medium-, and large-sized neurons. Coinjection with different unlabeled neurotrophins inhibited PNT-1 transport in distinct subpopulations of neurons of different sizes, suggesting that this molecule affects sensory neurons of different modalities. These results indicate that PNT-1 is a potent and multispecific neurotrophic factor that may be useful in the treatment of peripheral neurophathies and nerve damage.
2055225798	Marine sponges from shallow bays and estuaries along the Florida panhandle contained cadmium (Cd), 1.78-27.9 microg g(-1) (dry weight). Levels > 7 microg g(-1) were never found in a variety of other benthic invertebrates. Water levels of Cd were of the order 0.22-0.43 microg ml(-1) and did not differ significantly between the two study areas (Panacea and St. Joseph Bay). Cd in organic sediment however, was significantly (P = 0.033) higher around Panacea (0.343 +/- 0.063 S.E.M.) than in St. Joseph Bay (0.18 +/-0.223 S.E.M.). Salinity of 10 and pH 6.5 were recorded following heavy rains, and can constitute a hostile environment for these organisms. Temporal variations of Cd and Cu but not Zn were observed in Microciona prolifera over a period of 2 years in St. Joseph Bay, and a negative correlation was observed between Cd content and the Ca(2+)-induced aggregation of Microciona cells suspended in Ca2+/Mg(2+)-free artificial seawater. Cells unresponsive to Ca2+ aggregated in response to releasers of Ca2+ from internal stores (thapsigargin, A23187 and tetredecylamine), suggesting that they were viable but dormant. In vitro studies showed that Cd2+ is about equipotent with Ca2+ in inducing aggregation of Microciona cells, whereas lower concentrations (1-2 x 10(-3) M), added 10 min before inducing aggregation with CaCl2, inhibited aggregation, possibly by blocking Ca2+ uptake. Microciona contained a metallothionein (MT)-like protein. Taken together these results suggest that naturally-acquired Cd may interfere with cell regulatory processes in Microciona. Possible effects of low pH and salinity on Cd uptake and detrimental effects on cell function are discussed.
2055225846	48 From the beginning of the study of the Ice Age, our knowledge on the biotas of that time has been based on mammalian remains, associated organic remains (those of other vertebrates, invertebrates, and plants), and formations hosting these remains. To obtain as complete information as possible on paleolandscapes and paleobiotas, it is sometimes necessary to use data from cuts located far apart, and local factors may dis� tort the reconstruction. In 2002, on the middle Bol’shaya Chukoch’ya River (northern Yakutia, Fig. 1), Ivan Khristenko of the village of Andryushkino found skeletal remains of
2055225894	Increased tumour uptake of antibodies and antibody-drug conjugates has been demonstrated following pretreatment of animals with recombinant human tumour necrosis factor-α (rTNF-α) and interleukin 2 immunoconjugates. The experiments reported here were performed to determine whether improved tumour localisation of antibody-carboxypeptidase G 2 conjugates could be achieved, with a view to applying this technology to antibody-directed enzyme-prodrug therapy (ADEPT). B6CF 1 mice bearing the Ly-2.1 + murine thymoma E3 were simultaneously injected with 2.0 μgrTNF-α and 3.5 μg (74 kBq) 125 I-labelled murine anti-Ly-2.1-CPG 2 conjugate. Mice in control groups received phosphate buffered saline in place of rTNF-α. The conjugate corresponded in molecular weight to a mixture of 1:1 and 2:1 (CPG 2 :IgG) conjugate and retained its antigen binding specificity and enzymic activity in vitro . A significant increase in tumour uptake was observed 24 h after administration when rTNF-α-treated animals were compared to controls (28.1 ± 9.7% / g and 11.6 ± 2.3% / g, respectively). Other tissues, most notably gut, skin and kidney also showed an increased localisation of conjugate. By 48 h, analysis of tissue:blood ratios demonstrated that although tumour:blood ratios were significantly higher in rTNF-α-treated animals ( P
2055225909	The time-resolved thermodynamics of the flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-binding LOV1 domain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii phot (phototropin homolog) was studied by means of laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy. In the wild-type protein the early red-shifted intermediate LOV(715) exhibits a small volume contraction, DeltaV(715) = -1.50 ml/mol, with respect to the parent state. LOV(715) decays within few micro s into the covalent FMN-Cys-57 adduct LOV(390), that shows a larger contraction, DeltaV(390) = -8.8 ml/mol, suggesting a loss of entropy and conformational flexibility. The high energy content of LOV(390), E(390) = 180 kJ/mol, ensures the driving force for the completion of the photocycle and points to a strained photoreceptor conformation. In the LOV-C57S mutated protein the photoadduct is not formed and DeltaV(390) is undetected. Large effects on the measured DeltaVs are observed in the photochemically competent R58K and R58K/D31Q mutated proteins, with DeltaV(390) = -2.0 and -1.9 ml/mol, respectively, and DeltaV(715) approximately 0. The D31Q and D31N substitutions exhibit smaller but well-detectable effects. These results show that the photo-induced volume changes involve the protein region comprising Arg-58, which tightly interacts with the FMN phosphate group.
2055225960	Adult chickens were exposed for 48 h to a 525 Hz, 120 dB SPL tone that destroyed the hair cells and tectorial membrane in a crescent-shaped patch along the abneural edge of the basilar papilla. Single-unit recordings were obtained from cochlear ganglion neurons 0-1, 5, 14 and 28 days post-exposure to determine what effect the cochlear lesion had on neural discharge patterns and if the discharge patterns fully recovered. Immediately after exposure, the tuning curves were extremely broad and CF thresholds were elevated by 30-40 dB. In addition, the average spontaneous rate and percentage of neurons with interspike interval histograms with preferred intervals were greatly reduced. Tuning curves and spontaneous activity started to recover by 5 days post-exposure; however, some W-shaped tuning curves with two distinct tips and a hypersensitive tail were observed at this time. W-shaped tuning curves disappeared and spontaneous activity recovered to normal levels 14-28 days post-exposure. However, the CF thresholds of the most sensitive neurons were still slightly elevated, tuning curve slopes below CF were shallower than normal, and thresholds in the low-frequency tail of the tuning curves were often hypersensitive. These functional deficits were most closely associated with residual damage to the upper fibrous layer of the tectorial membrane. To determine if the cochlear frequency-place map was altered by the cochlear lesion, four physiologically characterized neurons were labeled with biocytin at 5 days post-exposure. The CFs of the labeled neurons were consistent with the normal frequency-place map (Chen et al. (1994) Hearing Research 81, 130-136) indicating that the tonotopic map was not altered.
2055225985	Background: Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein that adds TTAGGG nucleotide repeats onto the ends of eukaryotic chromosomes to maintain telomere integrity. Somatic cells do not express telomerase and stop dividing when the chromosomal ends are shortened critically after many cell divisions. Immortal cell lines and cancer cells apparently have telomerase activity that contributes to an unlimited number of cell cycles. The purpose of our study is to investigate whether telomerase activity is expressed in primary malignant tumors of the skeletal system when compared to adjacent normal tissue. Methods: Fresh tumor and normal tissue was collected from 14 patients (10 males, 4 females; age range, 8 to 76 years) and protein extraction performed. The tumors included seven osteosarcomas (three examined before and after chemotherapy), two chondrosarcomas, two spindle cell tumors, one hemangiopericytoma, one chordoma, and one adamantinoma. Telomerase activity was analyzed by using a highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay (telomere repeat amplification protocol [TRAP]). Results: Telomerase activity was found in 8 of 14 sarcoma patients (57%) using the TRAP assay. Compared to HeLa cell extract (positive control), telomerase activity in the tumor specimen ranged from 0 (in osteosarcoma) to 11.7% (in hemangiopericytoma). There was variation in the number of telomeric repeats generated by telomerase. At least five telomeric bands (e.g. 50, 56, 62, 68, 74 bp) in a ladder pattern had to be present before telomerase activity was considered positive in our analysis. Conclusions: Telomerase activity may be an oncogenic sustaining event helping to maintain the transformed phenotype seen in malignant tumors of the bone. The degree of telomerase activity varies among skeletal malignancies, but was less than that observed in HeLa cells. The majority of osteosarcomas showed no telomerase activity.
2055226029	Social odours, conspecific chemical signals, have been demonstrated in every class of vertebrate except birds. The apparent absence is surprising, as every bird examined has a functional olfactory system and many produce odours. The crested auklet ( Aethia cristatella ), a monogamous seabird, exhibits a distinctive tangerine–like scent closely associated with courtship. Using T–maze experiments, we tested whether auklets preferred conspecific odours and whether they distinguished between different types of scent, two prerequisites of chemical communication. Crested auklets exhibited: (i) an attraction to conspecific feather odour; (ii) a preference for two chemical components of feather scent ( cis –4–decenal and octanal), which we identified as seasonally elevated; and (iii) differential responses to odours, as indicated by a preference for auklet odour, an aversion to mammalian musk, but no significant response to banana essence (amyl acetate). Our results suggest that crested auklets detect plumage odour and preferentially orientate towards this stimulus. The striking and well–described courtship display that involves the scented neck region, the ‘ruff sniff’, provides a conspicuous behavioural mechanism for odour transmission and the potential for scent assessment during sexual selection. Although the importance and full social function of chemical signals are just beginning to be understood in birds, including crested auklets, social odours promise to reveal a largely unexplored and possibly widespread means of avian communication.
2055226035	Overt circadian rhythms are permanently disrupted following lesions of the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in hamsters. It has previously been demonstrated that whole tissue grafts which include the fetal SCN restore circadian locomotor rhythms to hamsters previously made arrhythmic by SCN lesions. In the present study, we ask whether the intrinsic peptidergic organization of the SCN is a prerequisite for functional recovery of circadian rhythms of locomotor activity. To this end, dispersed cell suspensions of [3H]thymidine-labelled fetal anterior hypothalamic tissue which contains the SCN, were injected stereotaxically into the brain of adult hamsters. Dispersed cell suspensions restored free-running locomotor rhythms, but not entrainment or gonadal regression. The period of the restored free-running rhythms following injections of SCN cell suspensions was shorter than 24 h, in contrast to intact hamsters whose rhythms are restored by whole tissue grafts. In animals with restored rhythms, a majority of [3H]thymidine-labelled cells were located within nuclei of the midline thalamus and zona incerta. In a few individuals, donor cells were also deposited along the injection tract as far ventrally as the medial hypothalamus. Restoration of free-running locomotor rhythmicity was correlated with the presence of small numbers of isolated VIP cells along with small plexuses of VIP fibers. In animals which did not recover locomotor rhythmicity, grafts were identical in location and size to those in recovered hamsters, but did not contain peptidergic cells characteristic of the SCN. The results suggest that structural integrity of the fetal SCN is not necessary for restoration of rhythmicity after grafting.
2055226045	Abstract Various histochemical changes were found in spinal segments L4–L5 of rats with adjuvant arthritis, predominantly 30 days after inoculation. A slight to marked increase of substance P immunoreactivity occured in laminae I, II and X. FRAP activity was enhanced in lamina II. Serotonin immunoreactivity was heavier in laminae I, VIII and IX in a few animals. The intensity of the histoenzymological reaction for succinic dehydrogenase increased in certain laminae VIII and X neurons. At day 15 of the disease the increase of substance P and FRAP activities was chiefly restricted to the medial portion of the superficial dorsal horn. There was a significant positive correlation between the scratching behaviour of arthritic rats and the substance P immunoreactivity in laminae X and I. If one accepts that scratching is pain-related, the data are consistent with a possible role of substance P in the chronic pain associated with adjuvant arthritis. They leave undetermined the significance of the other histochemical changes.
2055226067	Antifungal activity is positively correlated to furanocoumarin content in extracts of the traditional phytomedicine northern prickly ash (Zanthoxylum americanum Mill. [Rutaceae]). The specificity of these furanocoumarins in inhibiting replication of DNA was investigated with reference to significant base composition differences between fungal and mammalian mitochondrial DNA. We developed a polymerase chain reaction-based assay to investigate whether (1) furanocoumarins inhibit DNA polymerization and (2) distinct furanocoumarins specifically inhibit DNA replication depending on base composition. Specific inhibition of DNA polymerization by 5-methoxypsoralen and psoralen through high-adenine and thymine (AT) (84.3%) and low-AT (51.9%) DNA, respectively, suggests that furanocoumarins inhibit replicative functions of genomes or of regions within the genome that differ in base composition. Greater overall inhibition of DNA polymerization by Z. americanum husk extracts than with single or mixed furanocoumarins suggests that inhibitory compounds in addition to the major furanocoumarins are present in Z. americanum.
2055226097	Rapid-cycle real-time PCR by the LightCycler (Roche Molecular Biochemicals, Auckland, New Zealand) provides a very quick, one-step means of genotyping herpes simplex virus (HSV) from clinical samples and a number of assays involving this application have been reported (1, 2, 3).  However, we—among others—have found that a commonly used protocol (1) provides poor genotyping results when the published reagent concentrations are used. The PCR resulted in the “hook effect” phenomenon (Fig. ​(Fig.1)1) that is the sign of a very efficient PCR (Technical note no. LC 8/99, Roche Molecular Biochemicals, 1999). Simply, in later cycles of the PCR, the amplified strands reanneal before the probes can bind to generate fluorescence. For quantification, this is not an issue, since the crossing point (the cycle number where the reaction enters exponential phase) is of interest. However, subsequent genotyping by melting-curve analysis may be more difficult.    FIG. 1.  Amplification of HSV type 1 (HSV-1) and HSV-2 samples with published reagent concentrations. The drop in fluorescence at later cycle numbers caused by the hook effect is clearly visible.    We overcame this phenomenon by the use of asymmetric primer concentrations whereby a higher concentration of the reverse primer (compared to that of the forward primer) was used in the reaction. This resulted in more of the strand complementary to the probes being amplified and allowed more signal to be generated (Fig. ​(Fig.2).2). This in turn resulted in the easy genotyping of the HSV samples via melting-curve analysis (Fig. ​(Fig.3).3).     FIG. 2.  Amplification of HSV-1 samples.      FIG. 3.  Melting-curve analysis of HSV-1 samples.    We suggest that the use of asymmetric primer concentrations be considered when new LightCycler genotyping assays that result in the hook effect on the quantitation screen are being optimized.
2055226108	Glycoprotein hormones, follicle-stimulating hormones (FSHs), luteinizing hormones (LHs), thyroid-stimulating hormones (TSHs), and chorionic gonadotropin (CG) are key endocrine hormones secreted from the pituitary gonadotrophs and thyrotrophs and the placenta in primates. These hormones, consisting of a common alpha subunit and a specific beta subunit, act through the FSH receptor (FSHR), the LH receptor (LHR), and the TSH receptor (TSHR) that are highly specific for their cognate hormones. These glycoprotein hormones are structurally and functionally conserved in various vertebrates and have been identified in most lineages of actinopterygians (bony fish) and sarcopterygians (tetrapods). Of interest, recent genomic studies showed that vertebrate glycoprotein hormone receptors belong to an ancient subfamily of G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) named as leucine-rich repeat-containing GPCRs (LGRs). These findings have prompted the hypothesis that there could be additional glycoprotein hormones in vertebrate genomes. Indeed, searches of vertebrate genomes have led to the identification of two novel glycoprotein hormone subunits, glycoprotein alpha 2 (GPA2) and glycoprotein beta 5 (GPB5), as well as their homologs in invertebrates. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that GPA2 and GPB5 form a heterodimeric hormone, thyrostimulin/OGH, capable of activating TSHR in vivo and the thyroid axis in transgenic mice. However, the exact role of this novel glycoprotein hormone and its homolog in invertebrates is not clear. To gain a better understanding of the physiological role of the novel glycoprotein hormone subunits and their evolution, it is imperative to carry out systematic studies of these genes in representative model species. In the present report, we summarize our findings based on studies of genomes of model organisms from sea anemones to humans. We found that GPA2 and GPB5 represent the ancient forms of glycoprotein hormone alpha and beta subunits, respectively, and that vertebrate and invertebrate glycoprotein hormone subunit proteins shared common ancestors that evolved during early metazoan evolution. It is important to note that glycoprotein hormone alpha and beta subunit proteins from invertebrates formed a heterodimer with structural functional characteristics similar to that of vertebrate glycoprotein hormones. Taken together, both glycoprotein hormone alpha and beta subunits evolved before the evolution of nematodes, arthropods, and vertebrates. Parallel expansion of the alpha and beta subunits and their receptors through gene duplication and subsequent subfunctionalization and neofunctionalization of the duplicated genes allowed the development of multiple tissue-specific endocrine systems in vertebrates.
2055226154	Abstract We have demonstrated the presence, in the plasma of several patients with acute intermittent porphyria, of a substance which strongly induced the synthesis of porphyrins in chick embryo liver cells growing in primary culture. The induction response evoked by this humoral agent was in all respects similar to that elicited by drugs and hormones which are known to enhance porphyrin production by inducing the de novo formation of δ-aminolevulinate synthetase, the rate-limiting enzyme in this pathway. Inducing properties were not found in the plasma of normal individuals or in that from porphyric patients in remission. Significant inducing activity was, however, found in the plasma of some normal subjects ingesting drugs or contraceptive steroid mixtures.   The occurrence of a potent inducer of δ-aminolevulinate synthetase in the plasma of certain porphyric patients may have clinical significance for these genetically susceptible individuals. It will also permit chemical characterization of those humoral agents which may be related to the episodic exacerbations of this hereditary liver disease.
2055226225	Pigs were vaccinated with an attenuated Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV) vaccine and challenged with virulent JEV, either by subcutaneous injection or by exposure to infected mosquitoes. The vaccinated pigs developed circulating antibodies to JEV. After challenge they did not develop viremia detectable by inoculation of their serum in suckling mice. They were also unable to transmit virus to mosquitoes fed on their skin. In contrast, unvaccinated pigs, whether challenged by injection or by mosquito bites, developed viremia and did transmit virus to mosquitoes which were allowed to bite them. Transmission seemed possible for only 3 days post-infection.
2055226243	Objective To assess the expression and cellular distribution of angiotensin II (Ang II), angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), aminopeptidase A (APA), adipocyte-derived leucine aminopeptidase (A-LAP), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in human ovarian tissue during the menstrual cycle. Design Ovarian tissues (n = 52) and corpora lutea (n = 34) were obtained from patients undergoing hysterectomy/oophorectomy, and tissue sections were immunostained for each antigen. Setting University hospital. Patient(s) Patients undergoing hysterectomy or oophorectomy for benign conditions. Intervention(s) Immunostaining of tissue sections using antibodies to each antigen. Main Outcome Measure(s) Microscopic evaluation to assess the presence, distribution, and cellular localization. Result(s) The luteal tissue is the major site of Ang II, ACE, AT1R, and VEGF, with highest staining intensity found during the midluteal phase and at pregnancy. The AT1R was found in theca cells. The APA was strongly immunolocalized in pericytes. Immunolocalization of AT1R was almost similar to that of VEGF including oocytes in the primordial and intermediate follicles. Conclusion(s) The expression and distinct pattern of the cellular localization of Ang II and its related proteins in human ovarian tissue during folliculogenesis and in the luteal tissue suggest their roles in the growth and differentiation of theca, granulose, and luteal cells.
2055226245	The variations observed during earlier studies in the activity of NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase (EC. 1.1.1.42) in a strain of Aspergillus niger were found to be related to the extent of washing of mycelium. As a result the mycelium washed four times with phosphate buffer (0.05 M, pH 7.5), the enzyme activity present in 4 and 8 days old fungal mycelia increased five- and two-fold, respectively.    In vivo studies showed a complete loss of enzyme activity in mycelia resuspended in HCl-KCl buffer (0.02 M, pH 2.2) containing citric acid (13 mM or more). The in vitro studies revealed 50% loss of enzyme activity in presence of 3.6 to 5.2 mM citric acid. However, in case of Aspergillus niger ATCC 1015, which produced less citric acid than the above strain, a much higher citric acid concentration (13 to 26 mM) was required to cause 50% loss of enzyme activity. These findings suggest a correlation between citric acid inhibition of NADP+-isocitrate dehydrogenase and the ability of A. niger to accumulate citric acid in the medium.
2055226273	This study investigated rickettsial infection in animals, humans, ticks, and fleas collected in five areas of the state of Sao Paulo. Eight flea species (Adoratopsylla antiquorum antiquorum, Ctenocephalides felis felis, Polygenis atopus, Polygenis rimatus, Polygenis roberti roberti, Polygenis tripus, Rhopalopsyllus lugubris, and Rhopalopsyllus lutzi lutzi), and five tick species (Amblyomma aureolatum, Amblyomma cajennense, Amblyomma dubitatum, Ixodes loricatus, and Rhipicephalus sanguineus) were collected from dogs, cats, and opossums. Rickettsia felis was the only rickettsia found infecting fleas, whereas Rickettsia bellii was the only agent infecting ticks, but no animal or human blood was shown to contain rickettsial DNA. Testing animal and human sera by indirect immunofluorescence assay against four rickettsia antigens (R. rickettsii, R. parkeri, R. felis, and R. bellii), some opossum, dog, horse, and human sera reacted to R. rickettsii with titers at least four-fold higher than to the other three rickettsial antigens. These sera were considered to have a predominant antibody response to R. rickettsii. Using the same criteria, opossum, dog, and horse sera showed predominant antibody response to R. parkeri or a very closely related genotype. Our serological results suggest that both R. rickettsii and R. parkeri infected animals and/or humans in the studied areas.
2055226297	Many biologically active proteins are disordered as a whole, or contain long disordered regions. These intrinsically disordered proteins/regions are very common in nature, abundantly found in all organisms, where they carry out important biological functions. The functions of these proteins complement the functional repertoire of “normal” ordered proteins, and many protein functional classes are heavily dependent on intrinsic disorder. Among these disorder-centric functions are interactions with nucleic acids and protein complex assembly. In this study, we present the results of comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of the abundance and roles of intrinsic disorder in 2007 histones from 746 species. We show that all the members of the histone family are intrinsically disordered proteins. Furthermore, intrinsic disorder is not only abundant in histones, but is absolutely necessary for various histone functions, starting from heterodimerization to formation of higher order oligomers, to interactions with DNA and other proteins, and to posttranslational modifications.
2055226517	1. Heat stress causes oxidative stress, which decreases plasma antioxidants in poultry. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), the most abundant polyphenol in green tea, is a powerful antioxidant against lipid peroxidation. This experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary EGCG supplementation on performance, carcase characteristics, concentrations of malondialdehyde, lipid peroxidation indicator, vitamins C, E, A, cholesterol, triglyceride, and glucose in Japanese quail (Coturnix coturnix japonica) exposed to a high ambient temperature of 34°C. 2. One hundred and eighty Japanese quails (10 d old) were assigned at random to 6 treatment groups consisting of 10 replicates of three birds. Birds were kept in cages in a temperature-controlled room at either 22°C (thermo-neutral) or 34°C (heat stress) for 8 h/d. Birds were fed either a basal diet or the diet supplemented with 200 or 400 mg of EGCG/kg of diet. 3. EGCG supplementation linearly increased feed intake, live weight gain, feed efficiency, col...
2055226571	During the summer months of 1974–1985 chlorophyll-a and total P concentration, biomass of Daphnia hyalina, smelt Osmerus eperlanus, bream Abramis brama and pikeperch Stizostedion lucioperca, water temperature and water intake from lake IJsselmeer were monitored in Tjeukemeer. During this period there were manipulations with the bream and pikeperch stocks as a consequence of the termination of a gill-net fishery in 1977, and larval smelt immigrated each year from the large lake IJsselmeer and contributed largely to the yearly smelt recruitment.
2055226602	The detection of two males and one female of Amphipsylla sibirica sepifera on three Clethrionomys glareolus is pointed out. The rodents were taken in Alt Aneu and Espot, two towns of Lerida (a Spanish Province). The finding of this flea species on Spanish Pyrenees increases to the west its geographical distribution and adds one new species to the Iberian flea fauna.
2055226723	A new pronotal-win g mutant of the German cockroach, Blattella germanica (L.), has been described and studied. Morphologically, it is similar to previously described translocation proving traits (T(9, 10)Pw) in this species. Genetically it is inherited as an autosomal semidominant lethal with somewhat reduced viability especially through the males. Cytologically the trait is associated with a terminal deficiency of the ninth pair of meiotic chromosomes, and has been named Df(9)Pw. It is linked with the group VIII markers ru and st at average map distances of 3.4 and 1.5 units, respectively, thus allowing, for the first time, a positive linkage group-autosome correlation for the German cockroach. Comparative studies of the deficiency and translocation Pw traits have produced an approximation of translocation breakpoints and centromere location on autosomes 9 and 10, establishment of the relationship between the deficiency and the translocation, and a tentative assignment of specific traits to specific loca...
2055226895	The hormonal requirements for the regulation of Lv132 mRNA coding for two proteins secreted by the principal cells of the lizard epididymis were examined by organotypic culture experiments. Testosterone, R1881 and corticosterone induced accumulation of Lv132 mRNA in explants from lizards castrated immediately after differentiation of the principal cells. The induction by testosterone was inhibited by the addition of cyproterone acetate. Progesterone and oestradiol alone or in presence of testosterone were ineffective. Unlike the induction by testosterone, the effect of corticosterone did not require binding on the androgen receptor as shown by competition binding studies. Corticosterone failed to induce gene expression in organs containing only reserve cells in their epithelium at the onset of the culture. However, corticosterone plus testosterone had a synergistic effect. These data suggest that testosterone promotes the differentiation of principal cells from reserve cells during the culture time and that a primary action of testosterone is necessary to confer corticosterone responsiveness on this tissue. Furthermore, the primary effects of testosterone could be memorized by the tissue because the corticosterone responsiveness persists after castration.
2055226897	A 40-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive man had three relapses of visceral leishmaniasis (VL). In the third he developed nodular skin lesions of three types, some reminiscent of Kaposi's sarcoma. Biopsy of each type disclosed abundant dermal macrophages with a huge number of intracellular and extracellular Leishman-Donovan bodies. Rapid improvement of lesions was achieved after antiparasitic treatment. AIDS leads to atypical forms of leishmaniasis. Leishmania has been detected both in normal and pathological skin of these patients due to dissemination during VL. It is suspected that a considerable proportion of the population may be infected in endemic areas, Leishmania being opportunistic in immunosuppressed individuals. It is important to recognize the range of lesions that may occur in patients with HIV and VL, many of which are non-specific and may cause diagnostic difficulty.
2055226904	α1-Antitrypsin phenotypes were determined in 1,395 male Saskatchewan grain buyers. These included 1,254 type M, 80 MS, 35 MZ and 26 which were untyped or other rare phenotypes. Siblings and
2055226948	In previous studies the differentiation of the epithelium in the human hard palate has been described stereologically using parameters expressed per unit tissue volume. Since single epithelial cells represent the true biological units of this tissue, it became necessary to estimate the absolute size of such cells in order to transform density data into absolute data. Therefore, in the present study, a stereological method (originally developed for myocyte volume determination) was tested in terms of its applicability to stratified epithelia; the absolute size of differentiating epithelial cells was determined in the epithelium of the human hard palate. The results suggest that (1) rather precise determination of epithelial cell size is possible by using the modified myocyte volume determination, and (2) the average cell volumes are 926 ± 148, 4,111 ± 1,619, 4,394 ± 551 μm3 for the stratum basale, the upper stratum spinosum and the stratum granulosum, respectively. The results are discussed with respect to methodology and to differentiation phenomena in the epithelium of the human hard palate.
2055226978	Abstract In suspension cultures of mouse spleen cells, the addition of small amounts (1-100 ng) of a heterologous antigen to which the donor mice had been primed significantly increased the number of anti-sheep erythrocyte plaques appearing after stimulation with sheep erythrocytes. A similar addition to identical cultures from unprimed donors produced a small depression in the number of such plaques.
2055227027	Background Within the gut the autonomous enteric nervous system (ENS) is able to sense mechanical stimuli and to trigger gut reflex behaviour. We previously proposed a novel sensory circuit in the ENS which consists of multifunctional rapidly adapting mechanosensitive enteric neurons (RAMEN) in the guinea pig. The aim of this study was to validate this concept by studying its applicability to other species or gut regions.
2055227085	Here we test whether the incorporation of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA, 22:6), an (n-3) fatty acid, into lymphocyte membranes affects the expression of the surface proteins Thy-1.2 and CD8. DHA was incorporated into splenocytes by three methods: feeding mice diets containing menhaden (fish) oil, fusing splenocytes with DHA-containing phosphatidylcholine vesicles, and culturing splenocytes with DHA. Thy-1.2 and CD8 expression were measured by flow cytometry and complement-mediated lysis using a panel of monoclonal antibodies. As (n-3) fatty acid incorporation into the lymphocytes increased, the expression of one Thy-1.2 epitope and one CD8 epitope decreased; the expression of two CD8 epitopes increased. Although diet-induced changes in surface protein expression may result from selective migration of cell populations or the diet's effect on protein biosynthesis, fusion with lipid vesicles demonstrated that DHA-containing phospholipids can mediate a direct and immediate effect. The decrease in Thy-1.2 expression was sustained for more than a week after removal of (n-3) fatty acids from the diet, most likely due to retention of membrane-bound (n-3) fatty acids. Because Thy-1.2 and CD8 participate in T cell activation, modulation of their expression by DHA suggests that DHA, when serving as a membrane structural element, may alter immune function.
2055227089	The cardioselective muscarinic antagonist, AF-DX 116 [11[2-[(diethyl-amino)-methyl]-O-1-piperidinyl]-5,11-dihydro-6H-pyrido- [2,3-b][1,4]-benzodiazepine-6-one), was weak at blocking the M2 muscarinic receptor-mediated inhibition of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) formation in mouse neuroblastoma cells (clone N1E-115). In contrast, the glandular-selective antagonists, hexahydro-sila-difenidol (HHSiD) and 4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), were quite potent at inhibiting this response, being 14- and 318-fold more potent than AF-DX 116 in this regard, respectively. According to the rank order of potency of these two classes of antagonists, these data provide the first pharmacological evidence that inhibition of cAMP formation in a neuronal tissue is mediated by a non-cardiac M2 muscarinic receptor subtype.
2055227113	Abstract We describe surplus-killing of endangered giant kangaroo rats (Dipodomys ingens) by endangered San Joaquin kit foxes (Vulpes macrotis mutica) and consider the conditions that may have promoted such killing. We also use results of extensive mark-recapture surveys of rodents to document a decline in local density of the giant kangaroo rat that was likely caused by surplus-killing.
2055227147	A group of small RNA molecules, distinct from but related to siRNAs (small interference RNAs) have been identified in a variety of organisms. These small RNAs, called microRNAs (miRNAs), are endogenously encoded approximately 20-24 nt long single-stranded RNAs. They are generally expressed in a highly tissue- or developmental-stage-specific fashion and are post-transcriptional regulator of gene expression in animals and plants. This article summarizes the character, mechanism and analysis method about miRNAs. The current view that miRNAs represent a newly discovered, hidden layer of gene regulation has resulted in high interest among researchers in the discovery of miRNAs, their targets, expression mechanism of action and analysis methods.
2055227180	A comparative study of the effect of tissue and suspension allografts of an embryonic spinal cord on regeneration of nerve fibers of impaired (by application of a ligature) sciatic nerve in rats was conducted. It was demonstrated that unlike tissue grafts that reach a large volume 21 and 60 days after transplantation, suspension grafts do not inhibit the growth of axons of the recipient to the periphery. It was established that introduction of a suspension of dissociated cells of the spinal cord embryonic anlages (but not fragments of these anlages) into the impaired sciatic nerve in rats results in an increase in the amount of myelinated regenerating nerve fibers of the recipient 60 days after the operation.
2055227193	Within beetles, those species that are adapted to life on plants have developed widened tarsi with specialised hairy attachment structures. The capability to adhere to smooth surfaces is based on a liquid film on the surface of these structures, the composition of which is similar to the cuticular lipids. By means of a cluster analysis based on chemical similarities between samples obtained from tarsi or elytra of 35 species using solid phase microextraction, the present study strongly suggests that this chemical congruence is a principle in beetles. This supports the idea of tarsal liquids being part of the cuticular lipid layer and contributes to the understanding of liquid-mediated attachment systems.
2055227231	Abstract The polypeptide chain of many globular proteins is folded into two or more structural domains which are spatially separated from one another and are frequently based on different architectural principles. The conformation of such structural domains is, in general, conserved more faithfully (assuming divergent evolution) than the amino acid sequence. The preservation of structure may originate in the three-dimensional requirements for the conservation of essential functions. A method is discussed for the recognition and comparison of structural domains.
2055227235	"Previous studies have shown that the three-spot damselfish species complex [Dascyllus albisella Gill, D. auripinnis Randall and Randall, D. strasburgi Klausewitz, D. trimaculatus (Ruppell)] is an assemblage of five geographically distinct clades. The one exception was a single D. trimaculatus from French Polynesia, which grouped with ""Pacific Rim"" individuals. In the present study, an additional 252 individuals from French Polynesia collected between June 1996 and January 2002 were analyzed using PCR amplifications, restriction fragment length polymorphisms, and DNA sequencing of the mitochondrial control region. The French Polynesian D. trimaculatus belong to two distinct clades. One clade comprising 96% of the individuals includes haplotypes found only in French Polynesia. The other clade (4% of the individuals) is comprised of haplotypes that cluster with ""Pacific Rim"" individuals, a clade with widespread distribution from Japan to the Line Islands and from Wallis to Palau. Present data suggest that a small number of larvae from northwestern reefs (possibly Line Islands) may have occasionally reached and colonized French Polynesian reefs."
2055227238	The adipokine tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) 5a isoform exerts a growth factor-effect on pre-adipocytes. This study aimed to identify potential TRAP 5a interacting proteins in pre-adipocytes using pull down assays in combination with mass spectrometry. Nidogen-2, a protein shown to be expressed intracellularly and for secretion by pre-adipocytes, was shown to interact, through its globular G3 domain, with TRAP 5a in vitro. In vivo, TRAP 5a interacted with nidogen-2 in cultured 3T3-L1 mouse pre-adipocytes, as well as with transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) interacting protein (TRIP-1), which is a protein that has previously been suggested to interact with TRAP in bone. In addition, TRAP 5a and nidogen-2 co-localized in adipose tissue cells in situ. These results indicate that TRAP 5a interacts with nidogen-2 and TRIP-1 in pre-adipocytic cells.
2055227241	AbstractWe compared a length-at-date growth model to truss network (morphometric) models for classifying emigrating juvenile (age 0 through age 1) California Central Valley Chinook Salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha to three genetically identified races at upstream (salmon generally younger and smaller) and downstream (salmon generally older and larger) monitoring stations. Morphometric models including capture date and head to standard length ratio performed better than the growth model at distinguishing genetically assigned fall-run and late fall-run juveniles; prediction accuracy increased from 54.6% to 63.8% for upstream salmon and from 17% to 73% for downstream salmon. The growth model may over inflate downstream estimates of federally listed Chinook Salmon by misidentifying fall and late-fall runs (nonlisted) as winter and spring runs (both listed) as much as 83% of the time. Morphometric models did not improve run assignment for the listed runs; the growth model outperformed morphometric models at dow...
2055227287	Dengue virus produces a mild acute febrile illness, dengue fever (DF) and a severe illness, dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF). The characteristic feature of DHF is increased capillary permeability leading to extensive plasma leakage in serous cavities resulting in shock. The pathogenesis of DHF is not fully understood. This paper presents a cascade of cytokines, that in our view, may lead to DHF. The main feature is the early generation of a unique cytokine, human cytotoxic factor (hCF) that initiates a series of events leading to a shift from Th1-type response in mild illness to a Th2-type response resulting in severe DHF. The shift from Th1 to Th2 is regulated by the relative levels of interferon-gamma and interleukin (IL)-10 and between IL-12 and transforming growth factor-L, which showed an inverse relationship in patients with DF. fl 2000 Published by Elsevier Science B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.
2055227387	Many and large dumps exist in our knowledge about Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection and disease in infants and children. We still do not understand why some individuals do acquire and others do not acquire the infection in the presence of the same risk factors. We do not understand why some individuals convert from latent to active tuberculosis and why other individuals convert from active to inactive tuberculosis even without treatment. As a matter of fact the immune system mounts a bouncing, robust and polyedral defence against Mycobacterium tuberculosis, but the bacillus is so much artful and dextrous that it has ahead from this immunological fierce accoutrements. Mycobacterium tuberculosis survival, multiplication, and transmission are largely favoured by the immune mechanisms. The granuloma itself is more bacillus- than host-protective. These abilities make Mycobacterium tuberculosis one of more successful human pathogens, but dumps in our knowledge and the counterproductive immunity hinder development of new diagnostics, therapies and vaccines. This occurs in front of an infection which engages one third of the world population and a disease which kills in a year about 1.5 million individuals worldwide. Understanding mechanisms and meaning of immune response in tuberculosis marks out the foundations of strategies with a view to prepare effective vaccines and reliable diagnostic tools as well as to build up therapeutic weapons. To gain these objectives is vital and urgent considering that tuberculosis is a common cause of morbidity and is a leading cause of death.
2055227445	THE prevalence of Australia Au(1) antigen in apparently healthy individuals is high in the tropics and low in temperate climates1. Genetic factors have been incriminated1; but Prince2 suggested that insects might be vectors. This study was undertaken to find out the role of the common bloodsucking mosquitoes in Ibadan, Nigeria, in the transmission of Au(1) antigen.
2055227448	RlmM is an AdoMet-dependent methyltransferase that is responsible for 2′-­O-methylation of C2498 in the peptidyl-transferase loop of bacterial 23S rRNA. This modification occurs before assembly of the 50S ribosomal subunit, and lack of C2498 methylation can cause a slight reduction in bacterial fitness. Here, the purification and crystallization of RlmM from Escherichia coli as well as its preliminary crystallographic analysis are presented. Cocrystallization of RlmM with AdoMet was carried out and X-ray diffraction data were collected to a resolution of 2.30 A on beamline BL17U at the SSRF. However, electron density for AdoMet cannot be observed by comprehensive crystallo­graphic analysis, indicating that it is not bound by RlmM during the cocrystallization process. The structure was solved by molecular replacement and refinement is in progress. The crystal contained one molecule in the asymmetric unit and belonged to space group P21, with unit-cell parameters a = 56.07, b = 59.38, c = 54.35 A, β = 94.84°, which differs from the P31 or P3121 space groups of previously reported RlmM structures (PDB entries 4auk, 4atn and 4b17).
2055227491	A total of 8,134 aphids belonging to 87 species were collected with yellow pan traps during 13 months in Serra do Mar, Parana State. Eleven places at different altitudes (-10 m to 1000 m above sea level - a.s.l.) were surveyed. The occurrence and dominance of the aphids were related to altitude, local flora, and environmental disruption. The number of specimens was the highest at 78 m and 555 m a.s.l., but most of the species were classified as rare. The common species registered were either polyphagous or had their preferential host plants present in the areas. The species Aphis spiraecola, Toxoptera aurantii, Brevicoryne brassicae, Tetraneura nigriabdominalis, and Uroleucon ambrosiae occurred in all surveyed areas. There was no clear relation between the faunistic data with the environmental conditions and altitude of the areas. Traps placed in transitional areas between the macroenvironments of the Dense Atlantic Montane Ombrophyllous Forest and the Mixed Ombrophyllous Forest collected the highest number of aphid species.
2055227558	Counts of the number of pores of primary collecting tubules (ducts of Bellini) on renal papillae, and values calculated by adjusting the counts of compound papillae to those of “virtual” single papillae, were determined for kidneys of patients with end-stage renal failure. Values for chronic glomerulonephritis, Alport's disease, infantile polycystic disease, trisomy 18, and trisomy 13 were not abnormal. Kidneys of patients with CUTO showed significantly low pore counts, indicating that this process in some cases is a true hypoplasia, with mean reduction of number of ducts of Bellini of 26%. FGS showed a high proportion of single papillae (80% vs. normal 60%) with high virtual pore counts, suggesting that a developmental abnormality underlies this disorder (or this outcome of nephrotic syndrome). Cystinosis showed a high proportion of compound papillae (80% vs. 40%) but low virtual pore counts, implying that this genetic disorder causes both maldevelopment and postnatal functional abnormality of the kidney...
2055227650	Background  Chromosomal aneuploidy is a defining feature of carcinomas. For instance, in colon cancer, an additional copy of Chromosome 7 is not only observed in early pre-malignant polyps, but is faithfully maintained throughout progression to metastasis. These copy number changes show a positive correlation with average transcript levels of resident genes. An independent line of research has also established that specific chromosomes occupy a well conserved 3D position within the interphase nucleus.   Methodology/Principal Findings  We investigated whether cancer-specific aneuploid chromosomes assume a 3D-position similar to that of its endogenous homologues, which would suggest a possible correlation with transcriptional activity. Using 3D-FISH and confocal laser scanning microscopy, we show that Chromosomes 7, 18, or 19 introduced via microcell-mediated chromosome transfer into the parental diploid colon cancer cell line DLD-1 maintain their conserved position in the interphase nucleus.   Conclusions  Our data is therefore consistent with the model that each chromosome has an associated zip code (possibly gene density) that determines its nuclear localization. Whether the nuclear localization determines or is determined by the transcriptional activity of resident genes has yet to be ascertained.
2055227688	Abstract A full-length cDNA, encoding a Bowman-Birk protease inhibitor (BBI), was isolated from lentil immature seeds. The deduced amino acid sequence was longer than that of the BBI extracted from lentil seeds and contained two binding sites; the first inhibitory site inhibits trypsin whereas the second one inhibits chymotrypsin. In order to characterize this lentil BBI, a longer (complete) and its C-terminally processed (mature) form were heterologously expressed in the yeast Pichia pastoris. The recombinant BBI proteins proved to be active against trypsin and chymotrypsin, showing Ki values at nanomolar levels. Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that complete BBI was composed of an array of molecular masses, whereas mature BBI showed the presence of a major peak of the expected size. The effects of mature BBI on the growth of human colon adenocarcinoma HT29 and colonic fibroblast CCD-18Co cells were evaluated. Lentil BBI was able to inhibit the growth of such cells at concentrations higher than 19 μM, in a concentration-dependent manner; by contrast, the CCD18-Co cells were unaffected. These data broaden our knowledge of the beneficial biological activities of naturally-occurring BBI proteins and address the need for systematic evaluation of natural variants in order to design novel strategies in preventive medicine.
2055227764	Several established human glioma cell lines have been previously shown to express the common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen (cALLa, CD 10), an important marker in the diagnosis of human acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). The amino acid sequence of cALLa is identical to that of neutral endopeptidase (NEP,E.C.3.4.24.11), and cALLa expressed on leukemia and melanoma cell lines is enzymatically active NEP. In the present study, we investigated whether cALLa expressed on glioma cell lines is active NEP. We detected cALLa on 10 out of 13 glioma cell lines using 2 different anti-cALLa MAbs (A12-G4 and FAH99). NEP antigen, as detected by immunostaining with an anti-NEP MAb (135A3), was expressed on the same 10 lines. cALLa-positive, but not cALLa-negative cell lines displayed an endopeptidase activity. This activity could be blocked by phosphoramidon, a specific inhibitor of NEP. Furthermore, mRNAs hybridizing to an NEP-specific probe were present in cALLa-positive glioma cells but not in cALLa-negative cells. Taken together, the results provide strong evidence that cALLa-positive glioma cell lines express endopeptidase activity on the cell surface.
2055227788	1.  1. α-Amylase containing ethionine was separated in crystalline form from the culture medium of the methionine-requiring mutant of Bacillus subtilis.  2.  2. The sedimentation, viscosity and electrophoretical mobility of α-amylase containing ethionine were compared with those of normal enzyme. The molecular weight of α-amylase was estimated as 55,000.  3.  3.The peptides containing methionine and ethionine were separated by column chromatography from a tryptic hydrolysate of α-amylase containing ethionine, and the amino acid composition of these peptides was estimated.  4.  4. It was concluded that ethionine can be incorporated into the normal peptide-bond sequence of α-amylase, and that α-amylase containing ethionine has the same physico-chemical properties and enzyme activity as those of normal protein.
2055227797	Despite experience, that has been obtained in the field of islet isolation in large mammals for about the past 20 years, allo- and autotransplantation of both human and porcine islets are still not routine procedures. The reasons for islet isolation and purification associated problems, which prevent a continuous isolation success and regular islet transplantation, can be categorized to variables related to 1) pancreas donor; 2) pancreas procurement; 3) isolation-techniques and 4) purification techniques. The development of porcine and human islet isolation was carried out by the authors since 1986. During this period several techniques for the isolation and purification of human and porcine islets were compared with regard to their influence on islet isolation outcome, integrity of islet morphology, islet in-vitro and in-vivo function: sequential vs continuous digestion-filtration, counterflow elutriation vs neutral density separation, conventional density gradient centrifugation vs Cobe cell separation and discontinuous vs continuous gradient purification. Furthermore, we analysed the influence of donor factors and variables related to organ procurement on islet isolation success. From this experience we concluded that successful porcine islet isolation is possible if islets of adult donors are isolated utilizing the continuous digestion-filtration following distension with UW-solution prior to a neutral density gradient purification on a Cobe. Human islets can be successfully isolated by digestion-filtration and purified utilizing a continuous Ficoll-sodium-diatrizoate gradient on a Cobe when intact pancreata are harvested after a secondary pancreatic warm ischemia time 30 years.
2055227801	Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) are the most widespread mutualistic symbioses between the roots of most land plants and a phylum of soil fungi. AM are known to influence plant performance by improving mineral nutrition, protecting against pathogens and enhancing resistance or tolerance to biotic and abiotic stresses. The aim of this study was to investigate the frond proteome of the arsenic hyperaccumulator fern Pteris vittata in plants that had been inoculated with one of the two AM fungi (Glomus mosseae or Gigaspora margarita) with and without arsenic treatment. A protective role for AM fungi colonisation in the absence of arsenic was indicated by the down-regulation of oxidative damage-related proteins. Arsenic treatment of mycorrhizal ferns induced the differential expression of 130 leaf proteins with specific responses in G. mosseae- and Gi. margarita-colonised plants. Up-regulation of multiple forms of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and enolase, primarily in G. mosseae-inoculated plants, suggests a central role for glycolytic enzymes in arsenic metabolism. Moreover, a putative arsenic transporter, PgPOR29, has been identified as an up-regulated protein by arsenic treatment.
2055227818	We examined the relative contribution of dopamine (DA) receptors in the brain and periphery in the control of sham and real feeding of sucrose solutions. Intraperitoneal (IP) administration of pimozide, an antagonist of peripheral and brain DA receptors, suppressed both sham and real feeding in a dose-related manner. In contrast, IP injections of domperidone, a DA antagonist restricted to peripheral receptors, had no effect on either sham or real feeding. The inability of domperidone to influence sucrose intake did not result from a lack of biological activity of the drug because the identical doses of domperidone that failed to alter eating significantly inhibited gastric acid secretion. The results implicate central, but not peripheral, DA receptors in the control of the ingestion of palatable foods and also suggest that sham feeding is more sensitive to DA antagonism than real feeding.
2055227851	Among terrestrial biomes the groundwater domain is generally considered to be a species poor environment. This view results, mainly, from the large geographic scale faunistic surveys (tens and hundreds of kilometres) and the traditionally coarse spatial scale (i.e. macroscale level) of ecological analysis. This view has been challenged by Margalef (1993) who suggests that high diversities are to be expected in the subterranean environment comparable to those found in the deep sea because of environmental similarities, e.g. low energetic resources.  During the last twenty years long-term ecological research on much smaller scales, i.e. metres to hundred metres for interstitial media, a mesoscale approach, or kilometre size for karst systems was carried on. Long-term projects on limnic subsurface systems have shown that the species richness (SR) of the microcrustacea (Harpacticoida, Cyclopopoida, Ostracoda) is much higher than previously considered. Details on Harpacticoida of the alluvial bedsediments of a Pyreneean brook, the Lachein, and on Ostracoda of the alluvial sediments of the Danube plain (the phreatic zone), near Vienna, are presented. The SR values of the interstitial microcrustacea obtained through investigations at a mesoscale level are comparable to those of karstic and/or surface freshwater benthic water systems; they are lower than those of the deep-sea data sets for equivalent crustacean groups at a similar scale of investigation.  From the data presented we infer the following points: (a) The subterranean waters are much more rich in species than earlier accepted, at least for some organismic groups like the microcrustacean copepods and ostracods. (b) Hence, to describe the still unknown fauna it is appropriate to sample the subsurface waters at an ecological scale. (c) Only studies during long-term ecological projects and with intensive, quantitative, sampling programmes allow a correct evaluation of the subterranean faunal diversity. (d) The species richness of a given subsurface site is strongly dependent on the structure of the habitats and the functioning of the underlying ecosystems. (e) Finally we consider the rationale for the protection of the subterranean faunal diversity.
2055227899	Inverted duplications are a common type of copy number variation (CNV) in germline and somatic genomes. Large duplications that include many genes can lead to both neurodevelopmental phenotypes in children and gene amplifications in tumors. There are several models for inverted duplication formation, most of which include a dicentric chromosome intermediate followed by breakage-fusion-bridge (BFB) cycles, but the mechanisms that give rise to the inverted dicentric chromosome in most inverted duplications remain unknown. Here we have combined high-resolution array CGH, custom sequence capture, next-generation sequencing, and long-range PCR to analyze the breakpoints of 50 nonrecurrent inverted duplications in patients with intellectual disability, autism, and congenital anomalies. For half of the rearrangements in our study, we sequenced at least one breakpoint junction. Sequence analysis of breakpoint junctions reveals a normal-copy disomic spacer between inverted and non-inverted copies of the duplication. Further, short inverted sequences are present at the boundary of the disomic spacer and the inverted duplication. These data support a mechanism of inverted duplication formation whereby a chromosome with a double-strand break intrastrand pairs with itself to form a “fold-back” intermediate that, after DNA replication, produces a dicentric inverted chromosome with a disomic spacer corresponding to the site of the fold-back loop. This process can lead to inverted duplications adjacent to terminal deletions, inverted duplications juxtaposed to translocations, and inverted duplication ring chromosomes.
2055227946	It is first reported that plant young proembryos expressed exogenous reporter genes by electroporation. Young proembryos with 8–32 cells and globular proembryos with 250–400 cells could be isolated by enzymatic maceration combined with microdissection. After electroporation withGUS orGFP genes, the proembryos were cultured for 1–2 d in KM8p medium. At the field strength of electroporation 500–1500 V/cm, blue reaction of GUS or green fluorescence of GFP could be observed in the proembryos. The highest transient expression frequency of young proembryos (2.2%) was obtained at the field strength of 750 V/cm, whereas the highest frequency of globular proembryos (5.9%) was obtained at the field strength of 1 250 V/cm. Taking the proportion of transformed cells in the whole cells of proembryos as efficient transformation frequency, the efficient transformation frequency of the young proembryos was 7 times that of the globular proembryos.
2055227968	The study was to see the effect of administration of ruminal fungi on feed intake, growth rate, rumen fermentation and nutrient digestion of calves (TharparkarxHolstein-Friesian, average age: 10 months, average body weight: 130 kg). The 6 calves in first group were fed a mixture consisted of 50% wheat straw and 50% concentrate (Maize 62%, Groundnut cake 35%, Mineral mix. 2% and Common salt 1%) along with 1 kg green oats animal - 1 day - 1 while second group calves were fed the above-mentioned diet in addition to a dose of 160 ml (10 6 CFU/ml) fungal culture calf 1 week - 1 . The average dry matter intake per day was slightly lowered in fungal fed calves yet feed conversion ratio was higher. The average daily weight gain was significantly higher (15.37%) in fungal administered group as compared to control. The nutrient digestibility was increased for crude fibre, NDF and ADF with fungal administration. Digestible energy value of straw-based diet in terms of percent TDN also increased. The pH and NH 3 -N were lower whereas TVFA, total-N, TCA-N and number of zoospores were higher in rumen liquor in fungal administered group.
2055227979	The laboratory rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus) is widely used as a model for a variety of inherited and acquired human diseases. In addition, the rabbit is the smallest livestock animal that is used to transgenically produce pharmaceutical proteins in its milk. Here we describe a protocol for high-efficiency germline transgenesis and sustained transgene expression in rabbits by using the Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system. The protocol is based on co-injection into the pronuclei of fertilized oocytes of synthetic mRNA encoding the SB100X hyperactive transposase together with plasmid DNA carrying a transgene construct flanked by binding sites for the transposase. The translation of the transposase mRNA is followed by enzyme-mediated excision of the transgene cassette from the plasmids and its permanent genomic insertion to produce stable transgenic animals. Generation of a germline-transgenic founder animal by using this protocol takes ∼2 months. Transposon-mediated transgenesis compares favorably in terms of both efficiency and reliable transgene expression with classic pronuclear microinjection, and it offers comparable efficacies (numbers of transgenic founders obtained per injected embryo) to lentiviral approaches, without limitations on vector design, issues of transgene silencing, and the toxicity and biosafety concerns of working with viral vectors.
2055227993	Dorsoventral asymmetry in flowers of Antirrhinum depends on expression of the cycloidea gene in dorsal regions of floral meristems. To determine how cycloidea might be regulated we analysed its expression in several contexts. We show that cycloidea is activated shortly after floral induction, and that in addition to flowers, cycloidea can be asymmetrically expressed in shoots, even though these shoots show no marked dorsoventral asymmetry. Shoots expressing cycloidea include secondary branches lying just below the inflorescence, and shoots of floricaula mutants. Asymmetric cycloidea expression may also be observed within organ primordia, such as the sepals of terminal flowers produced by centroradialis mutants. Later expression of cycloidea within flowers can be modified by mutations in organ identity genes. Taken together, the results suggest that cycloidea can respond to a common dorsoventral pre-pattern in the apex and that the specific effects of cycloidea on the flower depend on interactions with floral-specific genes.
2055228052	In the present study, we aimed to elucidate the antioxidant property and anti-inflammatory activity of the aqueous extract of the Indian species of Ophiocordyceps sinensis (AECS), which demonstrates medicinal activity against numerous diseases. The chemical composition of AECS was quantified using a colorimeteric technique to determine the total phenolic and flavonoid contents. Antioxidant activity was determined by assays for 2,2'-azinobis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)diammonium salt (ABTS); 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl (DPPH); and ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Adenosine nucleoside and nitrogenous bases (adenine and uracil) were also quantified by high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC). Furthermore, the aqueous extract was also analyzed for anti-inflammatory activity in vitro using THP1 cells. THP1 cells were treated with and without lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and AECS (at 25 µg/mL, 50 µg/mL and 100 µg/mL, respectively) for 24 h. After 24 h, supernatants were harvested and kept at -80°C until the cytokine assays were performed. Furthermore, nitric oxide (NO) content was also estimated in treated and untreated murine peritoneal macrophages using Griess reagent. AECS significantly suppressed LPS-induced release of TNF-α and IL-1β in THP1 cells and significantly suppressed NO release in macrophage cells without exerting any toxic effect. These results indicate the anti-inflammatory activity of AECS. Additionally, this extract also has an antioxidant property, as high contents of phenols and flavonoids are present in the extract with considerable reducing power. The results of this study clearly demonstrate the potent antioxidant property and anti-inflammatory activity of AECS. Therefore, consumption of AECS may be clinically useful to protect against inflammatory diseases.
2055228100	Peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase NIMA-interacting 1 (Pin1) protein is known as a regulator which recognizes phosphorylated Ser/Thr-Pro motifs and increases the rate of cis and trans amide isomer interconversion, thereby altering the conformation of its substrates. We found that Pin1 knockdown using short hairpin RNA (shRNA) technology resulted in strong suppression of productive Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA replication. We further identified the EBV DNA polymerase catalytic subunit, BALF5, as a Pin1 substrate in glutathione S-transferase (GST) pulldown and immunoprecipitation assays. Lambda protein phosphatase treatment abolished the binding of BALF5 to Pin1, and mutation analysis of BALF5 revealed that replacement of the Thr178 residue by Ala (BALF5 T178A) disrupted the interaction with Pin1. To further test the effects of Pin1 in the context of virus infection, we constructed a BALF5-deficient recombinant virus. Exogenous supply of wild-type BALF5 in HEK293 cells with knockout recombinant EBV allowed efficient synthesis of viral genome DNA, but BALF5 T178A could not provide support as efficiently as wild-type BALF5. In conclusion, we found that EBV DNA polymerase BALF5 subunit interacts with Pin1 through BALF5 Thr178 in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Pin1 might modulate EBV DNA polymerase conformation for efficient, productive viral DNA replication.
2055228245	The effects of insulin and adrenalin on the metabolism of 14C-labelled glucose and lactate by perfused guinea pig hearts have been studied. In the absence of other exogenous substrates, adrenalin almost triples the amount of glucose oxidized to CO2, with a concomitant large increase in rates of glycolysis and glycogenolysis. Insulin has little or no effect on the rate of glucose oxidation, but greatly increases lactate accumulation, glycogen synthesis (from glucose), and amino acid labelling from 14C-glucose.In hearts from starved animals, or in the presence of acetate, both insulin and adrenalin markedly increase the rate of glucose metabolism. When both insulin and adrenalin are present, both glucose and lactate compete favorably with acetate and endogenous substrates for oxidation.
2055228276	Abstract This study was conducted on 20 rams, 6–8 months old. Semen was collected from all rams once weekly for 8 weeks after 4 months of different feeding treatments. The results revealed an improvement in the physico-chemical characteristics of ram semen after feeding ammoniated rice straw with or without alfalfa hay compared with untreated rice straw. It was concluded that ammoniated rice straw with 3% anhydrous ammonia in the ration can be recommended for feeding growing rams without any harmful effect on semen quality.
2055228288	Abstract Factors which enhance eosinophil-mediated killing of antibody-coated schistosomula of Schistosoma mansoni include semipurified eosinophil colony stimulating factor (CSF-α) and eosinophil cytotoxicity enhancing activity (E-CEA) present in supernatants from cultured mononuclear cells. We have examined the mechanism of enhancement. Both actions require oxygen in order to enhance killing and do not enhance killing under anaerobic conditions ( P ⩽ 0.005). E-CEA had no detectable effect upon oxidative metabolism. In contrast to CSF-α which, in our previous studies, increased Superoxide anion productions and quantitative leukocyte iodination, E-CEA had no detectable effect upon oxidative metabolism. In order to test whether active oxygen products might mediate enhancement of killing, the effects of the addition of Superoxide dismutase and catalase were tested. Neither enzyme showed inhibition of CSF-α or E-CEA enhancement of eosinophil-mediated killing. The effects of CSF-α and E-CEA were not additive. These studies suggest that both CSF-α and E-CEA exert enhancement of killing by means of an as yet unidentified oxygen requiring process.
2055228471	The present study documents the morphological changes in the aging human olfactory bulb. Eight bulb pairs from white females between the ages of 25 and 102 years were used. The number of mitral cells in layers IV and III was determined for each bulb and corrected for split cell error. Counts were made on 10-micron thick Nissl-stained sections at 250-micron intervals. The mean number of mitral cells per olfactory bulb at age 25 was estimated from linear regression to be 50,935; at age 60, 32,718; and at age 95, 14,501. The average loss over the time interval studied was 520 mitral cells per year. The volume of each bulb layer, except layer IV, was determined. The difference in the volume of each layer within individuals with age and the total volume with age was not significant (P less than 0.11). The estimated mean bulb volume was found to be 50.02, 43.35, and 36.68 mm3 at ages 25, 60, and 95 years, respectively. The estimated reduction in bulb volume per year increase of age was 0.19 mm3. The ratio of mitral cells to bulb volume for layer III decreased by 19.4 units for every year increase in age. No significant difference was found between the left and the right bulbs in regard to the number of mitral cells and the bulb volume. Histologically, the glomerular layer thickness as well as the mitral cell size and concentration per unit area decreased with age. The intrabulbar anterior olfactory nucleus was discontinuous, highly variable in size, and presumably variable even in neuronal numbers.
2055228473	Abstract Background and purpose Animal models have provided very valuable data to specify the physiopathological mechanisms of the various forms of epilepsy. However, the question arises of knowing which of these experimental results are relevant to the human epileptic brain. The development of epileptic surgery makes it possible to directly study the functional properties of human brain tissue in vitro and to analyze the mechanisms underlying seizures and epileptogenesis. We review some of the results obtained over the last few years in our laboratory based on electrophysiological, immunocytochemical and molecular experiments conducted on human brain tissue. Results This review covers a number of the mechanisms of neuronal synchronizations generating epileptiform discharges, including the role of electrical synapses connecting the inhibitory interneurons, particularly in Taylor-type focal cortical dysplasia and the functional lability of GABAergic inhibition in epileptogenic human cortical tissue, which may sustain triggering and propagation of seizures. Some of these mechanisms have not been described in animal models. Conclusions Studies on human tissue, when carefully designed, are necessary to validate the data collected on animal models and will continue to provide us with new and important information on the cerebral changes related to epilepsy. Moreover, these studies allow development of a class of antiepileptic drugs that have a completely new mechanism of action, which could be effective in the treatment of drug-resistant epilepsies.
2055228540	Environmental DNA (eDNA) methods for detecting and estimating abundance of aquatic species are emerging rapidly, but little is known about how processes such as secretion rate, environmental degradation, and time since colonization or extirpation from a given site affect eDNA measurements. Using stream-dwelling salamanders and quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis, we conducted three experiments to assess eDNA: (i) production rate; (ii) persistence time under different temperature and light conditions; and (iii) detectability and concentration through time following experimental introduction and removal of salamanders into previously unoccupied streams. We found that 44-50 g individuals held in aquaria produced 77 ng eDNA/h for 2 h, after which production either slowed considerably or began to equilibrate with degradation. eDNA in both full-sun and shaded treatments degraded exponentially to <1% of the original concentration after 3 days. eDNA was no longer detectable in full-sun samples after 8 days, whereas eDNA was detected in 20% of shaded samples after 11 days and 100% of refrigerated control samples after 18 days. When translocated into unoccupied streams, salamanders were detectable after 6 h, but only when densities were relatively high (0.2481 individuals/m(2) ) and when samples were collected within 5 m of the animals. Concentrations of eDNA detected were very low and increased steadily from 6-24 h after introduction, reaching 0.0022 ng/L. Within 1 h of removing salamanders from the stream, eDNA was no longer detectable. These results suggest that eDNA detectability and concentration depend on production rates of individuals, environmental conditions, density of animals, and their residence time.
2055228626	Riouxgolvania kapapkamui sp. n. (Nematoda: Muspiceoidea: Muspiceidae), a peculiar intradermal parasite, is described based on gravid adults, eggs, and first-, second-, and third-stage larvae collected from dermal nodules formed in Myotis macrodactylus and Myotis ikonnikovi bats from Hokkaido, Japan. The nematode is readily distinguished from 3 previously described congeners in having a globular body with brown, transverse striae in the anterior region of fully grown females. The third-stage larva is also distinguished from other congeners by having a round tail end. Nucleotide sequences of the analyzed partial SSU rDNA-ITS1 region and partial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 of mtDNA showed greater similarity to chromadoreans rather than to enopleans. This is the first report of muspiceoid nematodes from Asia.
2055228638	Recent finding has shown that LIMS2 (also known as PINCH2) functions as a natural regulator of the LIMS1-ILK-parvin complex formation and is associated with cell spreading and migration via integrins at focal adhesions. Here, we report for the first time the epigenetic silencing of LIMS2 in gastric tumors. Downregulation of LIMS2 was detected in 91% (10 of 11) of gastric cancer cell lines by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and 80% (8 of 10) of the LIMS2-downregulated cell lines were associated with CpG island hypermethylation at a 5'-upstream region of LIMS2. Furthermore, LIMS2 was restored in its non-expressing cell lines after treatment with 5-Aza-dC and/or trichostatin A. Loss of expression of LIMS2 was also detected in 53% (51 of 96) of primary gastric tumors. This decrease in expression level significantly correlated with an increase of the CpG island hypermethylation. In addition, the methylation status in any normal-appearing gastric tissues was gradually increased in an age-dependent manner, suggesting that the positive methylation in normal-appearing gastric mucosa can be due to 'field cancerization effect' as an early event in gastric carcinogenesis. Moreover, the transient transfection of LIMS2-siRNA significantly stimulated cell migration in gastric cancer cells but had no effects on cell growth. These results suggest that the frequent inactivation of LIMS2 by epigenetic alteration in gastric cancer may be important in tumor progression events, such as invasion and metastasis. Thus, LIMS2 may be useful as a molecular biomarker and a therapeutic target by increasing its expression and activity in gastric cancer.
2055228716	The objective of the present study was to investigate whether nuclear transfer of postmortem wolf somatic cells into enucleated dog oocytes, is a feasible method to produce a cloned wolf. In vivo-matured oocytes (from domestic dogs) were enucleated and fused with somatic cells derived from culture of tissue obtained from a male gray wolf 6h after death. The reconstructed embryos were activated and transferred into the oviducts of naturally synchronous domestic bitches. Overall, 372 reconstructed embryos were transferred to 17 recipient dogs; four recipients (23.5%) were confirmed pregnant (ultrasonographically) 23-25 d after embryo transfer. One recipient spontaneously delivered two dead pups and three recipients delivered, by cesarean section, four cloned wolf pups, weighing 450, 190, 300, and 490g, respectively. The pup that weighed 190g died within 12h after birth. The six cloned wolf pups were genetically identical to the donor wolf, and their mitochondrial DNA originated from the oocyte donors. The three live wolf pups had a normal wolf karyotype (78, XY), and the amount of telomeric DNA, assessed by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization, was similar to, or lower than, that of the nuclear donor. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated the successful cloning of an endangered male gray wolf via interspecies transfer of somatic cells, isolated postmortem from a wolf, and transferred into enucleated dog oocytes. Therefore, somatic cell nuclear transfer has potential for preservation of canine species in extreme situations, including sudden death.
2055228751	Epidemiological evidence suggests that hypertension and coronary heart disease are programmed by exposure to a poor diet during intrauterine life. It has been proposed that the prenatal environment may exert an adverse effect on the development of the kidney and hence later control of blood pressure. These assertions are supported by animal experiments. In the rat, fetal exposure to a maternal low protein diet is associated with disproportionate patterns of fetal growth and later elevation of blood pressure. Pregnant female rats were fed control (18% casein) or low protein diets throughout pregnancy, or during specific periods. Nephron number was determined at day 20 gestation, full term and 4 weeks of age. Exposure to low protein throughout gestation, or in mid-late gestation increased total nephron number at day 20. By term nephron number was reduced, relative to controls, in rats that were undernourished between days 8-14 or 15-22 gestation. At 4 weeks postnatally rats exposed to low protein throughout fetal life had a reduced (13%) nephron complement and blood pressures 13 mmHg above control animals. Lower renal size and elevated blood pressure persisted to 19 weeks of age, at which time glomerular filtration rate was normal. The data are consistent with the hypothesis that maternal undernutrition may programme the renal nephron number and hence impact upon adult blood pressure and the development of renal disease.
2055228856	Abstract As a consequence of progress in several fields, we are developing an understainding of the structural, thermodynamic and statistical rules that govern the binding of regulatory proteins to functional sites on the DNA genome. The current state of our understanding of these rules, and some approaches to the evolutionary selection pressures that underlie them, are summarized here.
2055228890	Background  Schistosomiasis is one of the most significant diseases in tropical countries and affects almost 200 million people worldwide. The application of molluscicides to eliminate the parasite's intermediate host, Biomphalaria glabrata, from infected water supplies is one strategy currently being used to control the disease. Previous studies have shown a potent molluscicidal activity of crude extracts from Piper species, with extracts from Piper tuberculatum being among the most active.   Methods and Findings  The molluscicidal activity of P. tuberculatum was monitored on methanolic extracts from different organs (roots, leaves, fruit and stems). The compounds responsible for the molluscicidal activity were identified using 1H NMR and ESIMS data and multivariate analyses, including principal component analysis and partial least squares. These results indicated that the high molluscicidal activity displayed by root extracts (LC50 20.28 µg/ml) was due to the presence of piplartine, a well-known biologically-active amide. Piplartine was isolated from P. tuberculatum root extracts, and the molluscicidal activity of this compound on adults and embryos of B. glabrata was determined. The compound displayed potent activity against all developmental stages of B. glabrata. Next, the environmental toxicity of piplartine was evaluated using the microcrustacean Daphnia similis (LC50 7.32 µg/ml) and the fish Danio rerio (1.69 µg/ml). The toxicity to these organisms was less compared with the toxicity of niclosamide, a commercial molluscicide.   Conclusions  The development of a new, natural molluscicide is highly desirable, particularly because the commercially available molluscicide niclosamide is highly toxic to some organisms in the environment (LC50 0.25 µg/ml to D. similis and 0.12 µg/ml to D. rerio). Thus, piplartine is a potential candidate for a natural molluscicide that has been extracted from a tropical plant species and showed less toxic to environment.
2055228902	Summary Twenty-one phages of Listeria monocytogenes (including 15 typing phages) have isometric heads and long, non-contractile tails. They are differentiated by tail length and belong to three morphological types. Type I resembles certain viruses of coryneform bacteria. In addition to normal phages, some lysates contain abnormally long tails with or without empty heads or terminal spikes, small heads resembling proheads of phage lambda, and helical filaments.
2055228915	Objective: To determine the prevalence and associated phenotype of myocilin (MYOC) coding sequence variations and a specific promoter polymorphism (MYOC.mtl) in patients with glaucoma and glaucoma suspects. Methods: A consecutive, unselected series of 779 patients (652 with open-angle glaucoma and 127 glaucoma suspects) were recruited from a university medical center and clinically characterized. The coding sequences of the MYOC gene and the MYOC.mtl locus in the promoter region were screened for sequence variations. We determined the prevalence of MYOC coding sequence mutations and the MYOC.mtl promoter polymorphism. We also compared the clinical features of individuals with and without mutations and the MYOC.mtl promoter polymorphism. Results: Plausible disease-causing sequence variations (DCVs) in the MYOC gene were found in 3.0% of the entire group. Such variations were found in patients with most forms of open-angle glaucoma studied. Patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) who harbored coding sequence DCVs were clinically similar to patients without them. Patients who harbored the rarer allele of the MYOC.mtl promoter polymorphism were no different in any measure of disease severity from those who harbored the more common allele. Conclusions: MYOC DCVs were found in approximately 3% of patients with glaucoma and glaucoma suspects. The 2 alleles of the MYOC.mtl promoter polymorphism were equally distributed among patients with POAG and healthy control subjects. Patients with POAG who harbored the rarer allele of the MYOC.mtl promoter polymorphism were no different from those with the more common variant in any measure of disease severity. Clinical Relevance: Testing for the MYOC.mtl promoter polymorphism appears to be of no value in the evaluation of patients with glaucoma.
2055228931	The selective action of nonantigenic tissue extracts on malignant cells was demonstrated using tissue culture techniques. The mitotic index of three strains of neoplastic cells was significantly reduced by the use of extracts which previously had proven effective in adversely affecting the development of spontaneous neoplasms. Under the same conditions the division rate of normal cells in tissue culture was not affected by the extracts. The malignant cells used were the Krebs 2, Sarcoma 180 and the L1210 leukemia. The normal cells were the L929 fibroblasts and epithelial-like cells from bone marrow and corneal tissue.
2055228957	A novel experimental sequence for the advanced undergraduate laboratory course has been developed at Earlham College. Utilizing recent improvements in molecular techniques for a time-sensitive environment, undergraduates were able to create a chimera of a selected gene and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in a bacterial expression plasmid over the course of a single semester in a weekly 3-h laboratory period. Students designed PCR primers for amplification of the selected gene using computational DNA sequence analysis tools. During the experimental portion of the course, students amplified and ligated the target DNA into a commercially available GFP expression vector. Following transformation of the ligation product, plasmids were harvested from the resulting bacterial colonies and were analyzed by restriction digestion to confirm the creation of the chimeric GFP-DNA. This course gave students valuable experience with commonly used molecular techniques in an authentic research project. In addition, students gained experience with experimental design and execution. The techniques presented here are flexible and can be generalized for use with almost any DNA sequence and expression vector. This series also serves as an example of how faculty can adapt their ongoing research projects to the undergraduate laboratory.
2055229002	C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) comprise a heterogeneous group of transmembrane proteins. Many of them are expressed in myeloid cells and signal in response to pathogen-derived or self ligands to initiate or regulate cell activation. Here, we review the properties of myeloid CLRs, highlighting how their signaling function is coordinated with that of other innate receptor families to control immunity to infection.
2055229046	In order to analyze connections between neurons in the vetebrate central nervous system, methods have been developed to label a given population of axons of known origin so that they can be differentiated from other, non-labeled structures. Three such methods are reviewed here: experimentally induced orthograde (Wallerian) degeneration, axon transport of radioactive proteins demonstrated by autoradiography, and axon transport of macromolecules that can be reacted histochemically to yield a visible reaction product. Each of the methods has particular strengths and weaknesses. Degeneration methods may differentiate between different functional classes of axons which have different fiber diameters. However, degeneration distorts the morphology of axon terminals, making them more difficult to interpret, and degenerating terminals may be removed rapidly by phagocytosis. Autoradiography of radioactive terminals preserves normal fine structure, but the necessary exposure times extend the method by weeks or months, and care must be exercised to distinguish labeled axons from other structures exhibiting background or transneuronal radioactivity. Histochemical methods, such as those used to demonstrate horseradish peroxidase conjugated to wheat germ lectin (WGA-HRP), are sensitive and rapid, but the injection site must be carefully characterized, and the presence of transneuronal label may make interpretation of the results difficult.    Experimental methods of axonal labeling have been invaluable in studying neuronal networks. Each of the methods described here may be of particular value, given the nature of the system to be analyzed.
2055229071	A unique feature of nitrogen-fixing nodules formed by association of species of Rhizobium and Frankia with various legumes and non-legumes is that they contain leghaemoblogin (Lb), an oxygen-carrying myoglobin-like protein1–6. Elucidation of the function of Lb, which is thought to facilitate the flow of oxygen to the nitrogen-fixing bacteroid forms of Rhizobium within infected nodule cells7,8, has been hindered by uncertainty regarding its precise intracellular location9. Several workers have reported that Lb is located exclusively in the plant cytoplasm in nodules of various legumes10–12, while others13–15 have concluded that some of the Lb is located in the peribacteroid spaces in some legumes. Using immuno-gold staining16 of Lb on thin sections of pea nodules, we demonstrate here that Lb can be detected in the plant cytoplasm and the nucleus of infected cells but not in the peribacteroid spaces.
2055229098	Freshwater ecosystems are critical but fragile environments directly affecting society and its welfare. However, our understanding of genuinely freshwater microbial communities, constrained by our capacity to manipulate its prokaryotic participants in axenic cultures, remains very rudimentary. Even the most abundant components, freshwater Actinobacteria, remain largely unknown. Here, applying deep metagenomic sequencing to the microbial community of a freshwater reservoir, we were able to circumvent this traditional bottleneck and reconstruct de novo seven distinct streamlined actinobacterial genomes. These genomes represent three new groups of photoheterotrophic, planktonic Actinobacteria. We describe for the first time genomes of two novel clades, acMicro (Micrococcineae, related to Luna2,) and acAMD (Actinomycetales, related to acTH1). Besides, an aggregate of contigs belonged to a new branch of the Acidimicrobiales. All are estimated to have small genomes (approximately 1.2 Mb), and their GC content varied from 40 to 61%. One of the Micrococcineae genomes encodes a proteorhodopsin, a rhodopsin type reported for the first time in Actinobacteria. The remarkable potential capacity of some of these genomes to transform recalcitrant plant detrital material, particularly lignin-derived compounds, suggests close linkages between the terrestrial and aquatic realms. Moreover, abundances of Actinobacteria correlate inversely to those of Cyanobacteria that are responsible for prolonged and frequently irretrievable damage to freshwater ecosystems. This suggests that they might serve as sentinels of impending ecological catastrophes.
2055229183	Cell-mediated immunity to Toxoplasma gondii establishes and maintains a balanced host-pathogen relationship. Recent analyses using spontaneous and genetically engineered mouse mutants have yielded a clearer picture of factors positively and negatively regulating the host immune response and a better understanding of cytokine-inducible intracytoplasmic mechanisms that lead to intracellular pathogen suppression and demise.
2055229218	Abstract An acidic nucleolar phosphoprotein with a subunit Mr of 70,000 was purified as an apparent dimer of 139,000 from isolated nuclei of the slime mold Physarum polycephalum. The protein was purified without the aid of strong dissociating agents after its selective phosphorylation in isolated nuclei by a polyamine-mediated reaction. Its amino acid composition resembled that of a nucleolar phosphoprotein from Novikoff hepatoma ascites cells. The phosphoprotein stimulated rRNA synthesis 5-fold by RNA polymerase I within a nucleolar, ribosomal deoxyribonucleoprotein complex isolated from nucleoli of P. polycephalum. It was also identified as a component of the complex. It bound with high affinity and specificity to the palindromic ribosomal DNA of 38 × 106Mr from P. polycephalum, which contained two coding sequences for 5.8S, 19S, and 26S rRNA. It also bound to three fragments of ribosomal DNA of Mr 21.2 × 106, 17.1 × 106, and 8.1 × 106, prepared by cleavage with restriction endonucleases HindIII, PstI, and BamHI, respectively. All of these fragments included the symmetry axis of the palindromic ribosomal DNA. The phosphoprotein that had been treated with alkaline phosphataseagarose to hydrolyze the phosphate groups did not stimulate transcription and did not bind to ribosomal DNA or to the restriction fragments indicated. We have thus isolated a specific phosphoprotein with the capacity to stimulate transcription of a specific set of genes in a eukaryote. These findings suggest that this phosphoprotein may specifically regulate functions of ribosomal DNA in a manner dependent on its degree of phosphorylation.
2055229289	Abstract Proteoliposomes were reconstituted by detergent dialysis of a sodium cholate extract of inverted vesicles derived from Escherichia coli plasma membrane. The translocation of precursor proteins into reconstituted vesicles occurred at high efficiency and was SecB dependent. The protein composition of the reconstituted vesicles differed markedly from that of native vesicles. Immunoblot analysis of the sodium cholate extract and of the reconstituted vesicles indicated that PrlA (SecY) protein remained largely unsolubilized under the described conditions and was virtually absent from the reconstituted vesicles, suggesting that PrlA may not be required for in vitro translocation.
2055229290	A 35-year-old woman with features of Kearns-Sayre syndrome consisting of progressive ptosis, ophthalmoparesis, mitochondrial myopathy, and pigmentary retinopathy also had autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 11 (Addison's disease, autoimmune insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and primary ovarian failure). There was no history of similarly affected relatives. Analysis of muscle mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) revealed a 2,532-bp deletion of the type seen in Kearns-Sayre syndrome as well as a heteroplasmic A3243G mutation in the tRNA-Leu(UUR) gene of the type seen in mitochondrial myopathy, encephalopathy, lactic acidosis, and strokelike episodes (MELAS). The patient's blood and her mother's blood harbored the A3243G mutation but not the deletion, and the maternal grandmother's blood had neither mutation. In muscle, the species of mtDNA harboring the deletion was exclusively associated with the species harboring the A3243G mutation, suggesting that the point mutation predisposed to the large-scale deletion. The mtDNA species with both mutations accounted for 88% of total muscle mtDNA. Other and as yet unrecognized point mutations in mtDNA might also be associated with, and possible causally related to, large-scale mtDNA deletions.
2055229405	The mouse epidermal JB6 cell system is a well developed model for studying tumor promotion, and the JB6 Cl 41 promotion sensitive (P+) cell line, in which transformed colonies are induced by epidermal growth factor (EGF), was used to test the anti-tumor promoting effect of seven tannins and two triterpenoids. We found that six tannins, ellagitannins (compounds 1, 2, 3 and 4) and chromone gallates (compounds 6 and 7), significantly blocked EGF-induced cell transformation in a concentration-dependent manner. The inhibition of cell transformation by the tannins was not due to growth inhibition. The ellagitannins, but not the chromone gallates, significantly attenuated EGF-induced activator protein 1 (AP-1) activation, a transcription factor. Compounds 1 and 3, among the ellagitannins analysed, inhibited the EGF-induced phosphorylation of extracellular-signal regulated protein kinases and p38 kinases, which regulate AP-1 activation. On the other hand, compounds 3 and 4 suppressed EGF-induced phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation. In addition, all tannins that blocked cell transformation markedly inhibited EGF-induced activation of Akt, a downstream effector of PI3K. Because signal-transduction pathways, including AP-1 and PI3K pathways, have been focused as prime targets for chemopreventive phytochemicals, our results suggest that inhibition by tannins of EGF-induced neoplastic transformation in JB6 cells is related to blocking of Akt activation, and also attenuation of AP-1 activation for ellagitannins.
2055229460	Abstract The changes in size of a population of, apparently, radioresistant mouse thymic lymphocytes has been investigated after irradiation. Following whole body irradiation, the total number of cells in the thymus varied in a cyclic fashion. The radioresistant population also exhibited a cyclic variation, but the variations were delayed in such a way that size reductions occurred during the regenerative phases of the organ. Bone marrow protection during the irradiation prevented a cyclic regeneration of the total thymus cell population and also of its subpopulation of radioresistant cells.
2055229469	Animals present an enormous variety of behavioural defensive mechanisms, which increase their survival, but often at a cost. Several animal taxa reduce their chances of being detected and/or recognized as prey items by freezing (remaining completely motionless) in the presence of a predator. We studied costs and benefits of freezing in immature Eumesosoma roeweri (Opiliones, Sclerosomatidae). Preliminary observations showed that these individuals often freeze in the presence of the syntopic predatory spider Schizocosa ocreata (Araneae, Lycosidae). We verified that harvestmen paired with predators spent more time freezing than when alone or when paired with a conspecific. Then, we determined that predator chemical cues alone did not elicit freezing behaviour. Next, we examined predator behaviour towards moving/non-moving prey and found that spiders attacked moving prey significantly more, suggesting an advantage of freezing in the presence of a predator. Finally, as measure of the foraging costs of freezing, we found that individuals paired with a predator for 2 h gained significantly less weight than individuals paired with a conspecific or left alone. Taken together, our results suggest that freezing may protect E. roeweri harvestmen from predatory attacks by wolf spiders, but at the cost of reduced food and/or water intake.
2055229479	Abstract During the past two years, a growing number of mutations have been identified in three of the four members of the fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) family as causing autosomal dominant disorders of skeletal and cranial development. These mutations map to the extracellular domain, the transmembrane domain, or the tyrosine kinase domain of these receptors. Recent studies demonstrate that a common mechanism, constitutive activation of receptor signaling, underlies most, if not all, of these disorders. This suggests a normal role for FGFRs in the negative regulation of bone growth.
2055229511	SUMMARY  Low GHVR competency is determined by B blood group and major histoin-compatibility genes or genes linked to B. Low GVHR competency is associated with resistance to the herpesvirus-induced lymphoma of Marek's disease. Herpesviruses increase genetically low GVHR competency, but have no effect on genetically high GVRH competency. This suggests that some major histoincompatibility genes restrain and lymphogenic herpesviruses stimulate T-lymphocyte proliferation. B-associated resistance to herpesvirus lymphoma is attributed to this restraint of T-lymphocyte proliferation.
2055229514	The bone marrow (BM) microenvironment plays a critical role in malignant cell growth, patient survival, and response to chemotherapy in hematologic malignancies. However, mechanisms associated with this environmental influence remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the role of Notch family proteins in myeloma and other malignant lymphoid cell line growth and response to chemotherapeutic drugs. All 8 tested cell lines expressed Notch-3 and Notch-4; 7 cell lines expressed Notch-1; and 6 expressed Notch-2 proteins. Interaction with BM stroma (BMS) activated Notch signaling in tumor cells. However, activation of only Notch-1, but not Notch-2, resulted in protection of tumor cells from melphalan- and mitoxantrone-induced apoptosis. This protection was associated with up-regulation of p21(WAF/Cip) and growth inhibition of cells. Overexpression of Notch-1 in Notch-1(-) U266 myeloma cells up-regulated p21 and resulted in protection from drug-induced apoptosis. Thus, this is a first report demonstrating that Notch-1 signaling may be a primary mechanism mediating the BMS influence on hematologic malignant cell growth and survival.
2055229535	An electro-optical (EO) approach has been used for studies of Listeria monocytogenes-antibody binding. The EO analyzer, which has been developed at the State Research Center for Applied Microbiology, Obolensk, was used as a basic instrument for EO measurements. AC electro-kinetic effects depend on dielectric properties of bioparticles, their composition, morphology, the medium, and the frequency of applied electrical field. Electro-orientational spectra were used for discrimination of bacteria before and after selective binding with antibodies. The measurements were performed using a discrete set of frequencies of the orienting electric field (10, 100, 250, and 500 kHz). During biospecific interactions an antibody is bound to the microorganism causing a change in the dielectric properties of the microorganism-antibody complex and the EO signal reaches its maximum at 100-200 kHz. It has been shown that the biospecific interactions of L. monocytogenes cells with anti-Listeria antibody in the presence of Escherichia coli K-12, and Azospirillum brasilense Sp7 change the EO signals significantly. Thus, the determination of the presence of particular bacteria within a mixed sample may be achieved by selection and matching of antibodies specific to individual bacterium types and by comparing spectra of bacterium in the presence and in the absence of specific antibody.
2055229559	Gastric mucosa tissue was collected from patients with gastroduodenal diseases in a region of norrteastern China showing a high risk of gastric cancer incidence. The presence of EBV and HPV were assayed to investigate the relationship between gastric carcinomas and virus infection. Neither EBV nor HPV DNA was detected in tissue from the patients. The role of EBV and HPV in gastric cancer is not well understood and still needs to be clarified.
2055229592	Single s.c. injections of 10 or 1000 mg/kg ofΔ9-THC did not induce discernable chromosomal damage but caused significant mitotic inhibition in the bone marrow of Syrian hamsters.
2055229637	The genotoxicity of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is well established. The underlying mechanism involves oxidation of DNA by ROS. However, we have recently shown that hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the major mediator of oxidative stress, can also cause genomic damage indirectly. Thus, H2O2 at pathologically relevant concentrations rapidly induces higher order chromatin degradation (HOCD), i.e. enzymatic excision of chromatin loops and their oligomers at matrix-attachment regions. The activation of endonuclease that catalyzes HOCD is a signalling event triggered specifically by H2O2. The activation is not mediated by an influx of calcium ions, but resting concentrations of intracellular calcium ions are required for the maintenance of the endonuclease in an active form. Although H2O2-induced HOCD can efficiently dismantle the genome leading to cell death, under sublethal oxidative stress conditions H2O2-induced HOCD may be the major source of somatic mutations.
2055229667	Cell suspensions of the psychrophilic bacterium, strain 82 produced the maximum amount of hydrogenase at 15C. No induction occurred at 25C and a limited amount of enzyme was formed at 0C. In comparison, mesophilic Escherichia coli and Aerobacter aerogenes produced maximum amounts of enzyme at 35C and 30C, respectively. No induction occurred at 10C.Psychrophilic Pseudomonas fluorescens produced maximum amounts of enzyme involved in benzoate oxidation at 25C and a large quantity of enzyme was produced at 5C. Induction did not occur at 35C or at 0C. In comparison, mesophilic Pseudomonas aeruginosa produced the largest amount of enzyme at 30C; induction did not occur at 45C or at 10C. Induction was most rapid for the psychrophile at 25C as contrasted to 35C for the mesophile.The data clearly show that the temperature range for induction of the above enzymes and for maximum enzyme formation is considerably lower in the psychrophiles than in the mesophiles.
2055229669	Intense investigation has centered on understanding the regulation of integrin cell adhesion receptors. In the present study, we propose that variant N-glycosylation represents an important mechanism for regulation of beta1, but not beta3 or beta5 integrins. We find that expression of oncogenic ras in HD3 colonocytes causes increased alpha2-6 sialylation of beta1 integrins, whereas expression of dominant-negative ras induces decreased alpha2-6 sialylation, relative to cells with wild-type ras. In contrast, neither beta3 nor beta5 integrins are alpha2-6 sialylated, regardless of the state of ras activation. Results from RT-PCR analyses suggest that differential integrin sialylation is due to a ras-dependent alteration in the expression of ST6Gal I, the enzyme that adds alpha2-6-linked sialic acids. Cells that express differentially sialylated beta1 integrins exhibit altered adhesion to collagen I (a beta1 ligand), but not to vitronectin (a beta3 or beta5 ligand). Similarly, the enzymatic removal of cell surface sialic acids from control cells alters binding to collagen, but not to vitronectin. Finally, using a cell-free receptor/ligand-binding assay, we show that purified, desialylated alpha1beta1 integrins have diminished collagen-binding capability, providing strong evidence that sialic acids play a causal role in regulating beta1 integrin function.
2055229720	The effect of light on the rate of visual cell loss in mice afflicted by therds (retinal degeneration slow) gene was analyzed by comparing the changes in the thickness of the outer nuclear layer. Visual cell loss in the pigmented, homozygous mutant mice, maintained in cyclic light, is slightly slower than in the albino mutant mice. In the pigmented mutant mice, exposed to constant light, and in the albino mutant mice, reared in darkness, rate of cell loss is not significantly altered. In the albino animals exposed to constant light, the rate of cell loss is faster in the homozygous mutant than in the normal, and intermediate in the heterozygous mutant retina. The accelerated cell loss in the mutant retina progresses from the centre to the periphery, and affects the rods earlier than the cones. This resembles the photic lesion in the normal retina but is unlike the genetic lesion in the mutant retina which appears to progress from the periphery to the centre and affects both rods and cones. It is concluded that the visual cells in the retina ofrds mutant mice are more vulnerable to photic damage than those in the retina of normal mice.
2055229721	The disposal and more efficient utilization of marine wastes is becoming increasingly serious. A culture media for microorganisms has been prepared from squid internal organs that are rich in polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). Both freshwater and marine bacteria grew well in this medium and some bacteria accumulated PUFAs in their lipids, suggesting uptake of exogenous PUFAs. Higher PUFA accumulations were observed in Escherichia coli mutant cells defective either in unsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis or fatty acid degradation, or both, compared to those without these mutations. Therefore, PUFA accumulation in cells can be improved by genetic modification of fatty acid metabolism in the bacteria. Squid internal organs would be a good source of medium, not only for marine bacteria but also for freshwater bacteria, and that this process may be advantageous to make efficient use of the fishery wastes and to produce PUFA-containing microbial cells and lipids.
2055229837	This study aimed to adopt MPN-PCR (most probable number-polymerase chain reaction) for rapid detection of the quantity of Vibrio parahaemolyticus in seafood. V. parahaemolyticus in seafood could be quantitated by MPN statistics according to PCR products. The sensitivity of MPN-PCR was 100 times higher than that of direct PCR. Of 225 seafood samples from Qingdao, 165 were positive for the presence of V. parahaemolyticus, with an MPN value of >719 per gram, and about 41.5% of samples were positive for tdh gene-possessing cells. Eighty muscle tissues from the 225 seafood samples were investigated by direct PCR and MPN-PCR, but no V. parahaemolyticus was detected. The MPN-PCR test could be completed in less than 16 h from the time of sample preparation. It was rapid, sensitive, and reliable for comprehensive detection and quick quantitative determination of V. parahaemolyticus in seafood and it revealed the potential risk of illness associated with their consumption.
2055229861	The use of agents to prevent the onset of and/or the progression to breast cancer has the potential to lower breast cancer risk. We have previously shown that the tumor-suppressor gene p53 is a potential mediator of hormone (estrogen/progesterone)-induced protection against chemical carcinogen–induced mammary carcinogenesis in animal models. Here, we show for the first time a breast cancer–protective effect of chloroquine in an animal model. Chloroquine significantly reduced the incidence of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea–induced mammary tumors in our animal model similar to estrogen/progesterone treatment. No protection was seen in our BALB/c p53-null mammary epithelium model, indicating a p53 dependency for the chloroquine effect. Using a human nontumorigenic mammary gland epithelial cell line, MCF10A, we confirm that in the absence of detectable DNA damage, chloroquine activates the tumor-suppressor p53 and the p53 downstream target gene p21, resulting in G1 cell cycle arrest. p53 activation occurs at a posttranslational level via chloroquine-dependent phosphorylation of the checkpoint protein kinase, ataxia telangiectasia-mutated (ATM), leading to ATM-dependent phosphorylation of p53. In primary mammary gland epithelial cells isolated from p53-null mice, chloroquine does not induce G1 cell cycle arrest compared with cells isolated from wild-type mice, also indicating a p53 dependency. Our results indicate that a short prior exposure to chloroquine may have a preventative application for mammary carcinogenesis. [Cancer Res 2007;67(24):12026–33]
2055229944	Abstract From the aerial parts of Delphinium crispulum five known norditerpenoid alkaloids, deltatsine, browniine, karakoline, ezochasmanine and isotalatizidine, and the C20 alkaloid hetisine as well as two new compounds, crispulidine and delphicrispuline, were isolated. Structures of the newly isolated alkaloids were established by spectroscopic methods.
2055229967	The bisegmented genome of a double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) virus from isolate LG115 of Ceratocystis resinifera, a sapstaining ascomycete fungus, was characterized. The larger segment (dsRNA-1) was 2305 base pairs in length, whereas the smaller one (dsRNA-2) was 2207 base pairs. The positive strand of dsRNA-1 contained an open reading frame (ORF) with the potential to encode a protein of 661 amino acids, and this ORF was closely related to coat proteins (CPs) of previously characterized fungal partitiviruses. The dsRNA-2 sequence encodes a putative protein of 663 amino acids, and this protein contains conserved motifs of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRPs) and is highly related to RDRPs of fungal partitiviruses. These results suggest that these two dsRNAs are the genome of a partitivirus. Nucleotide and amino acid comparisons revealed high similarities between this virus and a partitivirus described from Ceratocystis polonica, a closely related sapstaining fungus. Over the entire genome, the two viruses sha...
2055229978	Brain tissue was obtained at autopsy from a patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and kept frozen for nine months prior to attempts at virus isolation. Mixed cultures of trypsinized brain material and Vero monkey kidney cells developed cytopathic changes resembling those associated with measles virus. The cytopathogenic effect (CPE) was transferred by cells, and in later passages, also by culture supernatants. Cells and supematants from cultures showing CPE agglutinated monkey red cells. Haemagglutinationinhibition, immunofluorescent and neutralization experiments showed the cytopathogenic agent to be serologically similar to measles virus. Gel precipitation experiments, on the other hand, indicated differences in antigenic composition between the SSPE cultures and cultures of a vaccine (Edmonston) strain of measles virus. Ultrastructural studies revealed cytoplasmic inclusions of nucleocapsids in the SSPE cultures. The appearance and diameter of the SSPE nucleocapsids differed from those of the vaccine strain. Budding and complete viral particles were seen in both SSPE and vaccine strain cultures. It is concluded that the SSPE agent isolated here is most probably a measles virus, but in some respects different from the Edmonston strain of measles virus.
2055229982	Abstract 1. 1. The labelled acetate contained in the organism of the holothurian Stichopus japonicus can transform into triterpene glycosides. 2. 2. The hydrolysis of such glycosides resulted in a labelled aglycon of the lanosthane row, namely stichopogenin A4.
2055230071	Although the increase in the number of wild crows is causing social problems in urban areas, crows play an increasingly important role in monitoring serious infectious diseases, such as highly pathogenic avian influenza and West Nile fever. To gain a better understanding of normal conditions and common disorders in crows, we conducted a retrospective study of wild crows captured in central Japan in the 1990s and examined the necropsy findings from 166 jungle crows (Corvus macrorhynchos) and 74 carrion crows (Corvus corone). We found frequent development of lymphoid foci and inflammatory lesions in the kidneys of both species of crows. These findings were unrelated to place or date of capture, indicating the universality of renal lesion developments in the Corvus species. In the kidneys, suppurative granulomas were concentrated in the renal cortex and the vein wall, indicating the haematoegenous spread of causal agents. However, the glomeruli remained intact, unlike the spreading of causal agents via arterial blood, which strongly suggested the renal portal blood as a possible entry route of causal agents. The renal lymphoid foci showed the same distribution as the granulomas, supporting the possibility of external agents entering through renal portal blood. We also identified types of parasites in Japanese wild crows by means of histopathological analysis. We hope that our data will contribute to the appropriate evaluation and a better understanding of pathological conditions in Japanese wild crows.
2055230131	An animal’s antioxidant system is fundamentally complex aiming at finding a balance between pro-oxidative and anti-oxidative stressors in the body. To further unravel the animal’s response to oxidative stressors we used free-range broilers combined with severe feed restriction as opposed to conventional broilers as a reference. At 21 days of age, 36 Ross 308 broilers were divided into three groups. The first group (I42) was raised indoors according to common practices and fed ad libitum. The second group (O42) was transferred to outdoors on a grass pasture and fed once daily 50% ad libitum. At 42 days of age, eight birds from each group were sampled. The third group (O70) was reared similar to O42 but was sampled at 70 days, having approximately the same final weight as birds I42. Compared to I42 birds, the O42 birds showed a higher and lower concentration of malondialdehyde and a-tocopherol in their plasma, respectively; indicating oxidative stress after 3 weeks of free-ranging and feed restriction. As a response, the glutathione synthesis was up-regulated as manifested by increased levels of glutathione in the liver in O42 compared with I42, and in the jejunal mucosa in O42 and O70 compared with I42, and by a three- to four-fold increase in erythrocytes in O70 compared with the other groups. Regarding meat quality, the outdoor birds showed a darker and yellower colour of breast meat as compared with those reared indoors. Muscle total fatty acid content was higher in O42 compared to I42 and O70, which was reflected in the content of individual fatty acids (mg/100g meat), whereas differences in fatty acid profile (% of total fatty acids) between groups were marginal. To conclude, free-ranging together with feed restriction elicited remarkable changes in the animal’s antioxidant system, while changes in meat oxidative stability were less pronounced and more difficult to interpret.
2055230144	Objective. To characterize immunologic specificity and possible antiidiotype activity of IgG anti-F(ab') 2 in normal subjects as well as in patients with active and inactive systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Methods. IgG anti-F(ab') 2 and anti-doublestranded DNA (anti-dsDNA) were affinity isolated from immunoadsorption columns of F(ab') 2 and dsDNA linked to Sepharose 4B. Affinity-purified IgG anti-F(ab') 2 (APAF) and affinity-isolated IgG anti-dsDNA (APAD) were tested by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for other cross-reacting specificities including anti-Sm, anti-Sm/RNP, and anti- Crithidia binding. Anti-DNA specificity of APAF and APAD was assayed by S1 nuclease treatment of heat-denatured DNA. Rabbit antiidiotypic antisera were prepared by immunization with APAF and APAD from normal subjects and SLE patients and absorption with insolubilized human Cohn fraction II (Fr II). V L and V H regions of 5 monoclonal IgM antibodies with anti-F(ab') 2 /anti-DNA specificity generated by Epstein-Barr virus B cell stimulation were sequenced by polymerase chain reaction and characterized for V H and V L subgroup. APAF and APAD were also examined by high-resolution electron microscopy for possible ring forms indicative of antiidiotypic V-region interactions. Results. APAF from normal subjects, representing 0.08-0.18% of serum IgG, showed striking relative concentrations of both anti-F(ab') 2 and anti-DNA, as well as anti-Sm and anti-Sm/RNP ELISA reactivity. Both APAF and APAD reacting with F(ab') 2 or dsDNA on the ELISA plate could be cross-inhibited by F(ab') 2 or DNA in solution. Anti-DNA reactivity in normal APAF and APAD was much more sensitive to S1 nuclease treatment than similar fractions from SLE patients. Neither APAF nor APAD from controls produced positive antinuclear immunofluorescence or positive Crithidia staining, whereas these were strongly positive using SLE APAF and APAD. Absorbed rabbit antisera against normal or SLE APAF and APAD showed strong ELISA reactivity against both APAF and APAD, but no residual reactivity with normal Fr II. V L and V H sequencing of monoclonal human IgM antibodies showing both anti-F(ab') 2 and anti-DNA reactivity showed relative V H 3, Vκ1 or V H 1, Vκ3 restriction. No evidence of ring forms or V-region kissing dimers was obtained when normal or SLE APAD or APAF was examined by high-resolution electron microscopy. Conclusion. IgG anti-F(ab') 2 in both normal subjects and SLE patients represents a polyreactive Ig subfraction with concomitant anti-DNA, anti-Sm, and anti-Sm/RNP specificities. Anti-DNA reactivity in SLE is qualitatively different from that in normal APAD and APAF since normal APAD and APAF anti-DNA is much more sensitive to S1 nuclease digestion of denatured dsDNA. APAF and APAD share distinct V-region antigens which may be related to prominent V H 3 or V H 1 antigenic components. No evidence for in vivo complexing of anti-DNA and anti-F(ab') 2 as ring forms or antiidiotype-IgG complexes was observed during ultrastructural studies. In both normal individuals and SLE patients, APAF may represent a small polyreactive IgG subfraction which also contains antinuclear and anti-DNA specificities.
2055230203	The anticonvulsant drug carbamazepine has been reported to produce a condition clinically and biochemically similar to acute intermittent porphyria (AIP). We have determined the effect of chronic carbamazepine treatment on the activities of the enzymes of haem biosynthesis in circulating blood cells and on the urinary excretion of porphyrins and their precursors in 53 epileptic patients receiving monotherapy and in 42 age- and sex-matched controls. In the patients the mean activity of leucocyte 5-aminolaevulinic acid (ALA) synthase, the rate-limiting enzyme of the pathway, was 218% of control values (p<0.001) and ALA-dehydratase activity was reduced by 37% (p<0.001). Circulating carbamazepine concentrations correlated negatively with ALA dehydratase (rs=−0.45;p<0.01). Porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase appeared unaffected by carbamazepine treatment. Significant quantitative increases in the urinary excretion of porphobilinogen and total porphyrins (bothp<0.05) accompanied the changes in enzyme activity. Similar dose-dependent effects on ALA synthase and ALA dehydratase were shown to occur in rats treated for 5 days with 3 different doses of carbamazepine. These findings further support the porphyrinogenicity of carbamazepine, but the pattern of enzyme alteration differs from that found in AIP.
2055230212	Whether or not the hypothalamus is involved in initiating hepatic DNA synthesis after partial hepatectomy is unclear. To determine the role of the ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei in liver regeneration after partial hepatectomy, we studied hepatic DNA synthesis during liver regeneration in rats with bilateral lesions of these nuclei. Lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus accelerated the increase in hepatic DNA synthesis and raised the peak level of thymidine incorporation after partial hepatectomy. These effects of hypothalamic lesions were completely inhibited by hepatic vagotomy. Thus, lesions of the ventromedial hypothalamus appear to promote hepatic regeneration by increasing vagal stimulation of the liver.
2055230228	Oligodeoxynucleotides spanning codon 12 of the human c-Ha-ras gene were found to be exceptionally good substrates for de novo methylation by human DNA(cytosine-5)methyltransferase. In the complex formed by two complementary 30mers, only the C-rich strand was methylated by the enzyme. Guanines at the 3′ end of the G-rich strand of the complex could not be completely modified by dimethylsulfoxide suggesting tetrameric bonding at these G-residues. An eight-stranded structure, composed of four duplex DNAs at one end, joined to a G4-DNA segment at the other with the junction between the two DNA forms at codon 12, can account for our results.
2055230241	Abstract The effects of low night temperature (LNT, i.e., 9 and 6 °C) stress and rewarming (15 °C night temperature) on the photosynthesis, photosystems I and II (PSI and PSII), and antioxidant system of tomato leaves were studied. The results showed that 9 d of LNT treatment led to an irreversible reduction in the photosynthetic rate. This reduction was accompanied by stomatal limitation of CO 2 supply and significant decline in ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase activity at the transcription level, as well as sucrose accumulation. LNT treatment induced the reversible photoinhibition of PSII, decreased PSII activity, increased the photochemical yield of PSI Y (I), and markedly caused the acceptor side limitation of PSI. This finding was reflected by the higher value of Y (NA) in the treated plants than in the control. At the same time, a downregulation of electron transport for photosynthetic carbon reduction under LNT was mostly compensated by J a(O 2 -dependent) driven by the water–water cycle.
2055230251	Fibroblastic polyps of the colon and intestinal perineuriomas are unusual mucosal lesions with identical clinical and histologic features, and apparent different immunohistochemical and ultrastructural characteristics. However, immunohistochemical distinction was solely based on the results obtained
2055230252	The first chromosomal data in Hoplosternum littorale from an isolated South American drainage in north-eastern Brazil are presented. All specimens were characterized by a diploid number (2n) of 60 chromosomes divided into three metacentric, one submetacentric and 26 acrocentric pairs; single nucleolar organizer regions (NOR) on the sixth pair; centromeric and interstitial heterochromatin; GC-rich sites on four large acrocentric chromosomes, including the NOR-bearing pair, and 5S ribosomal genes at terminal region on short arms of two acrocentric pairs. These data are invariably similar to previous reports in H. littorale from distant localities throughout South America, which contrasts with the chromosomal diversity of Callichthyidae and reinforces the role of human activities on the dispersal and colonization of this fish.
2055230286	Abstract Previously we found increases in quantal content (m) and smaller increases in quantal size (v) during long-term potentiation (LTP) in CA1 of hippocampal slices. However, the validity of the deconvolution technique was questioned recently because v estimates correlated with the noise standard deviation (Sn). In computer simulations we show a double-step dependence of v on S n v : correct v estim overestimates (correlated with Sn) for S n v >0.5 . A novel ‘noise addition’ procedure is proposed for accepting relia double-step relationship between v and Sn. Quantal analysis of LTP for more reliable solutions confirmed previous conclusions.
2055230309	Abstract Two experiments were conducted in order to compare the effects of several phospholipid (PL) sources prepared from soybean lecithin on growth and survival of start-feeding carp larvae. Eight diets were tested in each experiment. All diets contained 94% of the same casein–dextrin mixture and 6% of added lipid, consisting of peanut oil alone or supplemented with a PL source. In both experiments, diets supplemented with fractions enriched in phosphatidylinositol (PI) resulted in the highest survival (95% after 25 and 31 days, respectively). Addition of phosphatidylcholine (PC) allowed high initial growth rates during the first week of feeding, similar to or higher than those obtained with PI, but induced a peak of mortality afterwards and, in the first experiment, a high frequency of deformed fish. Larvae fed PC-enriched diets started to die at a larger size than larvae fed PL-deficient diets. Other tested fractions with phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylserine or phosphatidic acid as the major PL class resulted in intermediate results between those given by PI- and PC-rich fractions. Dietary hydrogenated soybean PC resulted in a decreased growth compared to native soybean PC. Soybean lysolecithin was inferior to original lecithin for final larval growth and survival, but was superior to peanut oil without PL. Present results confirm that both the polar head group and the fatty acid composition of the dietary PL may affect their nutritional value for larval carp and suggest distinct requirements for PI and PC.
2055230330	We experimentally examined the phenotypic cost (as measured by the effect on seed set) associated with an inducible alkaloidal response in Nicotiana sylvestris (Solanaceae). Alkaloid concentrations were partially uncoupled from leaf damage in two experiments with the use of two techniques: (1) applying auxins to damaged leaf edges, and (2) minimizing the damage to veins of the leaf. Both of these techniques inhibited the induced response. In both experiments with flowering—stage plants, damaged plants with elevated alkaloids contents had lower reproductive output than similarly damaged plants with low alkaloid contents. Plants were able to compensate for damage inflicted during the rosette stage; reproductive output of damage plants did not differ from that of control plants. In addition, we found a significant negative correlation between seed number and leaf alkaloid content in undamaged full—sib plants. While these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the alkaloidal response to damage is associated with diminished reproductive output, and decrement in reproductive output cannot be directly attributed to alkaloid production because other unmeasured responses to damage may accompany the alkaloidal response to damage and thereby confound these measures of phenotypic cost. Last, we examined the consequences of altering leaf alkaloid concentrations, within the range found during the induced response, on rates of carbon gain and found no effect in tobacco.
2055230387	Abstract Studies on the physiological role of motilin, and more recently, on the relationship between motilin and erythromycin A, have been hampered by the lack of antagonists. We now have discovered such a compound. ANQ-11125 displaces motilin bound to an homogenate of rabbit antral smooth muscle tissue. The dissociation constant (pKd) was 8.16 ± 0.10. However, ANQ-11125 did not induce contractions of segments of rabbit duodenum, except at high concentrations. In the presence of 1 μM ANQ-11125 the dose response curves of erythromycin-A, De(N-methyl)-N-ethyl-8,9 anhydroerythromycin A 6,9-hemiacetal and motilin were shifted about one log unit to the right, but the responses to ACh and Substance P were unaffected. Schild-analysis showed the competitive nature of the interaction and allowed the calculation of the pA2 : 7.03 ± 0.05 (motilin curves) and 7.55 ± 0.06 (EM-523 curves). This is the first report of a motilin antagonist. Its properties definitively prove that motilides are motilin agonists.
2055230463	Sugarcane (Saccharum spp.) in south Florida is often subjected to flooding due to intense summer rainfall or tropical storms. While there has been considerable research on the response of sugarcane cultivars to high water tables, there is a lack of information on cultivar morphological adaptation to long-term flooding. An experiment was established in Belle Glade, FL to examine: (i) effects of a July-September flood on the morphological characters of cv. CP 80-1743 and CP 72-2086 and (ii) significant flood x cultivar interactions that could be used to screen sugarcane germplasm. Sugarcane leaf, stem, primary root, adventitious root, and aerenchyma development were measured in the plant cane (2003) and second ratoon crops (2005). Morphological changes in response to flooding were similar in both years, with flooding leading to a 38% reduction in leaf weight, 4 to 15 times greater adventitious root development, 108% greater aerenchyma pipe extension, and 115% greater aerenchyma pipe diameter. Both cultivars responded to flooding by producing aboveground adventitious roots at the expense of belowground primary root biomass. A significant cultivar X flood interaction on aerenchyma extension and diameter was noted. Under nonflooded conditions, CP 72-2086 produced constitutive aerenchyma more than halfway up the stalk, whereas CP 80-1743 produced aerenchyma only 10% up the stalk. Aerenchyma development up the stalk may be a useful screening tool to identify flood-tolerance in sugarcane cultivars.
2055230476	In recent decades, the multi-functional protein nucleolin (NCL) has been reported to express outside the nucleus of many cancer cells. However, the expression and role of the extra-nuclear NCL in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) were not well characterized. Here, NCL was detected by immunohistochemistry and Western blotting in 60 ESCC tissues. Further, the associations of NCL, EGFR, CXCR4 and Ki67 were analyzed by in vitro assays. Our results showed that NCL expression in all 40 cases of ESCC tissues with metastasis was extensively located in the nucleus, cytoplasm and cell membrane (extra-nucleus), while NCL expression in all 20 cases of ESCC without metastasis was merely limited into the nucleus (intra-nucleus).The extra-nuclear NCL expression was positively correlated with the expression of EGFR, CXCR4 and Ki67 and serves as an independent prognostic factor for ESCC patients. In vitro, NCL siRNA (si-NCL) efficaciously affected the expression of EGF or SDF-1-induced p-AKT, p-ERK and Ki67. Also, NCL siRNA inhibited the capacity of migration and invasion of ECA109 cells. In conclusions, our study suggests that NCL is implicated in the initiation and transduction of EGFR and CXCR4 signaling and further up-regulates Ki67 expression to modulate the biological behaviors of ESCC. Clinically, the extra-nuclear NCL expression can be used as an important indicator to determine metastasis and predict the prognosis, which help develop new therapeutic strategies against ESCC.
2055230542	Epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs) are pluripotent stem cells derived from epiblasts of postimplantation mouse embryos, and thus provide a useful model for studying “primed” pluripotent states. Here, we devised a simple and robust technique to derive high-quality EpiSCs using an inhibitor of WNT secretion. Using this method, we readily established EpiSC lines with high efficiency and were able to use whole embryonic portions without having to separate the epiblast from the visceral endoderm (VE). Expression analyses revealed that these EpiSCs maintained a homogeneous, undifferentiated status, yet showed high potential for differentiation both in vitro and in teratomas. Unlike EpiSCs derived by the original protocol, new EpiSC lines required continuous treatment with the Wnt inhibitor, suggesting some intrinsic differences from the existing EpiSCs. The homogeneous properties of this new version of EpiSCs should facilitate studies on the establishment and maintenance of a “primed” pluripotent state, and directed differentiation from the primed state.
2055230561	Despite the relative simplicity of Arabidopsis root organization, there is no general agreement regarding the terminology used to describe the longitudinal zonation pattern (LZP) of this model system. In this opinion article, we examine inconsistencies in the terminology and provide a conceptual framework for the LZP that may be applied to all angiosperms. We propose that the root apical meristem (RAM) consists of the cell-proliferation domain where cells maintain a high probability to divide and the transition domain with a low probability of cell division; in both domains cells grow at the same, relatively low, rate. Owing to stochastic termination of cell proliferation in the RAM, the border between the domains is ‘fuzzy’. Molecular markers analyzed together with quantitative growth and cell analyses could help to identify developmental zones along the root and lead to a better understanding of the LZP in angiosperms.
2055230592	Prolactin directly affects erythrophores and xanthophores of teleost fish, resulting in pigment dispersion. In the present study, signal transduction elicited by prolactin was examined using split-tail fin preparations of the rose bitterling and Nile tilapia, and cultured erythrophores and xanthophores from the paradise goby and rose bitterling. When antibodies to the prolactin receptor were added to an ovine prolactin (oPRL) solution, pigment dispersion within cultured cells was significantly inhibited, suggesting the existence of a prolactin receptor in the cell membrane. In mammals and birds, prolactin receptors belong to a cytokine receptor superfamily and signal through a tyrosine kinase-mediated pathway. Therefore, we examined the effects of three kinds of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors on pigment dispersion elicited by oPRL. None of those inhibitors depressed the response. On the other hand, lithium ions (an inhibitor of adenylate cyclase) and H-88 and H-89 (inhibitors of protein kinase A) decreased the levels of oPRL-induced pigment dispersion in a dose-dependent manner. In cultured cells treated with cholera toxin for 3 hrs, the effect of oPRL was irreversible, indicating the possible involvement of Gs protein in the prolactin action. From these results, we conclude that cAMP may be a second messenger in the dispersion of pigment induced by prolactin and that a novel protein receptor coupled with a Gs protein may be present in the membrane of erythrophores and xanthophores of teleost fish.
2055230639	Two pathways are responsible for the majority of regulated protein catabolism in eukaryotic cells: the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) and lysosomal self-degradation through autophagy. Both processes are necessary for cellular homeostasis by ensuring continuous turnover and quality control of most intracellular proteins. Recent studies established that both UPS and autophagy are capable of selectively eliminating ubiquitinated proteins and that autophagy may partially compensate for the lack of proteasomal degradation, but the molecular links between these pathways are poorly characterized. Here we show that autophagy is enhanced by the silencing of genes encoding various proteasome subunits (α, β or regulatory) in larval fat body cells. Proteasome inactivation induces canonical autophagy, as it depends on core autophagy genes Atg1, Vps34, Atg9, Atg4 and Atg12. Large-scale accumulation of aggregates containing p62 and ubiquitinated proteins is observed in proteasome RNAi cells. Importantly, overexpressed Atg8a reporters are captured into the cytoplasmic aggregates, but these do not represent autophagosomes. Loss of p62 does not block autophagy upregulation upon proteasome impairment, suggesting that compensatory autophagy is not simply due to the buildup of excess cargo. One of the best characterized substrates of UPS is the α subunit of hypoxia-inducible transcription factor 1 (HIF-1α), which is continuously degraded by the proteasome during normoxic conditions. Hypoxia is a known trigger of autophagy in mammalian cells, and we show that genetic activation of hypoxia signaling also induces autophagy in Drosophila. Moreover, we find that proteasome inactivation-induced autophagy requires sima, the Drosophila ortholog of HIF-1α. We have characterized proteasome inactivation- and hypoxia signaling-induced autophagy in the commonly used larval Drosophila fat body model. Activation of both autophagy and hypoxia signaling was implicated in various cancers, and mutations affecting genes encoding UPS enzymes have recently been suggested to cause renal cancer. Our studies identify a novel genetic link that may play an important role in that context, as HIF-1α/sima may contribute to upregulation of autophagy by impaired proteasomal activity.
2055230641	Abstract Restricting amplification of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) DNA to wild-type (WT) HCMV is useful to exclude PCR contaminations by laboratory strains from viral cultures. A set of UL141-specific TaqMan PCRs was developed to amplify (1) WT HCMV and laboratory strain Townelong, but not strain AD169, (2) only WT HCMV. The performance was compared to a PCR targeting the conserved sequence of HCMV glycoprotein B using 46 serum and urine samples from blood donors with primary CMV infection. Amplification was restricted to the targeted strains with the exception of Townelong being amplified also by PCR (2), but at a distinctly lower efficiency than WT HCMV. The coefficient of regression for linear dilutions of two clinical samples with a high concentration of HCMV DNA was 0.999 and 0.997, respectively. The correlation between both WT PCRs and the generic HCMV PCR was good, with coefficients of regression of 0.891 and 0.871 for PCR (1) and (2), respectively. The limit of detection was calculated to be 1.5 genome equivalents per PCR. The set of HCMV TaqMan PCRs enables rapid differentiation between WT and laboratory strains, which can be especially useful as even virus lysate can contaminate sensitive PCRs without prior DNA isolation. A standardized WT HCMV control would be useful to evaluate WT-specific PCR methods.
2055230686	Cultured roots of Stephania cepharantha, which are rich sources of bisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids, were fed 14C-labelled tyrosine, tyramine or dopamine. While tyrosine was well incorporated into the bisbenzylisoquinolines, tyramine and dopamine were poorly incorporated. Incorporated tyrosine was shown to be decarboxylated and stored as tyramine in the roots, then gradually converted to the bisbenzylisoquinolines. Tracer experiments using [3-13C]tyrosine demonstrated that tyrosine was specifically incorporated into the corresponding sites of aromoline, which verified that aromoline was composed of four molecules of tyrosine. The ratio of 13C-enrichments of C-4 and C-α in (R) and (S) halves of aromoline was the same within experimental limits. This indicated that the two coclaurine units must have one and the same biogenetic origin.
2055230688	Drugs activating 5-hydroxytryptamine 2C receptors (5-HT2CRs) potently suppress appetite, but the underlying mechanisms for these effects are not fully understood. To tackle this issue, we generated mice with global 5-HT2CR deficiency (2C null) and mice with 5-HT2CRs re-expression only in pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons (2C/POMC mice). We show that 2C null mice predictably developed hyperphagia, hyperactivity, and obesity and showed attenuated responses to anorexigenic 5-HT drugs. Remarkably, all these deficiencies were normalized in 2C/POMC mice. These results demonstrate that 5-HT2CR expression solely in POMC neurons is sufficient to mediate effects of serotoninergic compounds on food intake. The findings also highlight the physiological relevance of the 5-HT2CR-melanocortin circuitry in the long-term regulation of energy balance.
2055230716	A connection is hypothesized between the physiological consequences of mutualistic symbiosis and life's average long-term impact on certain highly biologically conserved environmental variables. This hypothesis is developed analytically and with a variant of the Daisyworld model. Biological homeostasis is frequently effective due to co-ordination between opposing physiological “rein” functions, which buffer an organism in response to an external (often environmental) perturbation. It is proposed that during evolutionary history the pooling of different species' physiological functions in mutualistic symbioses increased the range of suboptimal environmental conditions that could be buffered against—a mutual tolerance benefit sometimes sufficient to outweigh the cost of cooperation. A related argument is that for a small number of biologically-crucial physical variables (i) the difference between organism interiors and the life-environment interface is relatively low, and (ii) the biologically optimum level of that variable is relatively highly conserved across different species. For such variables, symbiosis tends to cause (at a cost) an increase in the number of environmental buffering functions per unit of selection, which in turn biases the overall impact of the biota on the state of the variable towards the biological optimum. When a costly but more temperature-tolerant and physiologically versatile symbiosis between one black (warming) and one white (cooling) “daisy” is added to the (otherwise unaltered) Daisyworld parable, four new results emerge: (1) The extension of habitability to a wider luminosity range, (2) resistance to the impact of “cheater” white daisies with cold optima, that derive short-term benefit from environmental destabilisation, (3) the capacity to maintain residual, oscillatory regulation in response to forcings that change more rapidly than allele frequencies and (crucially) (4) “succession”-type dynamics in which the tolerant symbiosis colonises and to an extent makes habitable an otherwise lifeless environment, but is later displaced by free-living genotypes that have higher local fitness once conditions improve. The final result is arguably analogous to lichen colonisation of the Neoproterozoic land surface, followed by the Phanerozoic rise of vascular plants. Caution is necessary in extrapolating from the Daisyworld parable to real ecology/geochemistry, but sufficiently conserved variables may be water potential, macronutrient stoichiometry and (to a lesser extent) the temperature window for metabolic activity.
2055230737	Summary A group of 39 strains isolated from pigeons, parakeets, parrots, sheep, goats, cats, guinea-pigs, mice and humans were immunotyped by a one-way or two-way cross-reaction micro-immunofluorescence test. Eight immunotypes were found. Among them, two new immunotypes were characterized: a cat conjunctivitis strain and a mouse inapparent respiratory infection strain. The immunotypes of feline pneumonitis and guinea-pig conjunctivitis, recently described by Perez-Martinez and Storz, were confirmed. Three human strains were similar to avian isolates, while a fourth was identical to that of feline pneumonitis ; this suggests a possible contamination of humans by cats.
2055230767	The brainstem-spinal cord preparation from neonatal rat has been used in several reports to evaluate the central effect of low oxygen level on the respiratory network. We demonstrate that bilateral lesion of retrotrapezoid nucleus and parapyramidal area unmasks an early reinforcement of the respiratory output in response to anoxia. This suggests that neurons in both areas might trigger or relay a central depressive influence of hypoxia on the respiratory network.
2055230897	Abstract To study the effects of short-term fluctuation of nitrate concentrations on the nitrate-reducing community, repacked soil cores were amended with 0, 100 and 300 μ g NO 3 - ‐ N g - 1 soil and incubated for 3, 7 and 14 days, respectively. The nitrate reductase activity was determined in a laboratory-based enzyme assay. In parallel, the community structure of nitrate-reducing microorganisms was characterised by RFLP-PCR using the functional gene narG , which encodes the catalytic site of the membrane-bound nitrate reductase. The community structure remained constant over the experimental period indicating that this functional community is characterised by a high resistance towards fluctuating nitrate concentrations. Decreases in nitrate concentration as well as increase in pH values indicated a very active nitrate-reducing community under nitrate addition. Surprisingly, inhibition of nitrite reductase by 2,4-dinitrophenol, which is a precondition for the measurement of nitrate reductase activity, could not be achieved in the 100 μ g NO 3 - ‐ N treatment despite increased concentrations of the inhibitor. However, comparison of the nitrate reductase in the control and the 300 μ g NO 3 - ‐ N treatment showed a significant increase in the latter at day 3. No further differences were observed at days 7 and 14, which suggests a high resilience of the nitrate reductase activity.
2055230903	A major outcome of the canonical Wnt/beta-catenin-signalling pathway is the transcriptional activation of a specific set of target genes. A typical feature of the transcriptional response induced by Wnt signalling is the involvement of Tcf/Lef factors that function in the nucleus as the principal mediators of signalling. Vertebrate Tcf/Lef proteins perform two well-characterized functions: in association with beta-catenin they activate gene expression, and in the absence of Wnt ligands they bind TLE/Groucho proteins to act as transcriptional repressors. Although the general characteristics of Tcf/Lef factors are well understood, the mechanisms that control their specific roles in various cellular backgrounds are much less defined. In this report we reveal that the evolutionary conserved Dazap2 protein functions as a TCF-4 interacting partner. We demonstrate that a short region proximal to the TCF-4 HMG box mediates the interaction and that all Tcf/Lef family members associate with Dazap2. Interestingly, knockdown of Dazap2 not only reduced the activity of Wnt signalling as measured by Tcf/beta-catenin reporters but additionally altered the expression of Wnt-signalling target genes. Finally, chromatin immunoprecipitation studies indicate that Dazap2 modulates the affinity of TCF-4 for its DNA-recognition motif.
2055230973	Lineage conversion has recently attracted increasing attention as a potential alternative to the directed differentiation of pluripotent cells to obtain cells of a given lineage. Different means allowing for cell identity switch have been reported. Lineage conversion relied initially on the discovery of specific transcription factors generally enriched and characteristic of the target cell, and their forced expression in cells of a different fate. This approach has been successful in various cases, from cells of the hematopoietic systems to neurons and cardiomyocytes. Furthermore, recent reports have suggested the possibility of establishing a general lineage conversion approach bypassing pluripotency. This requires a first phase of epigenetic erasure achieved by short overexpression of the factors used to reprogram cells to a pluripotent state (such as a combination of Sox2, Klf4, c-Myc and Oct4), followed by exposure to specific developmental cues. Here we present these different direct conversion methodologies and discuss their potential as alternatives to using induced pluripotent stem cells and differentiation protocols to generate cell populations of a given fate.
2055231034	Obesity and type 2 diabetes are associated with mitochondrial dysfunction in adipose tissue, but the role for adipose tissue mitochondria in the development of these disorders is currently unknown. To understand the impact of adipose tissue mitochondria on whole-body metabolism, we have generated a mouse model with disruption of the mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) specifically in fat. F-TFKO adipose tissue exhibit decreased mtDNA copy number, altered levels of proteins of the electron transport chain, and perturbed mitochondrial function with decreased complex I activity and greater oxygen consumption and uncoupling. As a result, F-TFKO mice exhibit higher energy expenditure and are protected from age- and diet-induced obesity, insulin resistance, and hepatosteatosis, despite a greater food intake. Thus, TFAM deletion in the adipose tissue increases mitochondrial oxidation that has positive metabolic effects, suggesting that regulation of adipose tissue mitochondria may be a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of obesity.
2055231039	Didanosine, a purine analogue with antiretroviral activity, is used in the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus disease. Associated toxic effects of didanosine include pancreatitis, peripheral neuropathy, and retinopathy. The retinal lesions associated with didanosine therapy were studied in a 6-year-old girl with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Gross examination disclosed multiple well-circumscribed depigmented lesions in the midperipheral retina. Microscopic examination of these lesions showed multiple areas of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) loss, some surrounded by areas of hypertrophy or hypopigmentation of the RPE. Partial loss of the choriocapillaris and neurosensory retina were also noted in areas of diseased RPE. Transmission electron microscopy showed numerous membranous lamellar inclusions and cytoplasmic bodies in the RPE cells. These data show that didanosine primarily affects the RPE and that the choriocapillaris and overlying neurosensory retina are also dystrophic in areas of RPE loss.

2055231106	SUMMARY A broiler breeder flock was subcutaneously vaccinated at the hatchery with a live avian orthoreovirus (ARV) vaccine against viral arthritis. Chicks began to die at 3 days of age and postmortem examination revealed massive subcutaneous hemorrhages and edema on the dorsal aspect of the neck at the site of vaccination, a severe necrotic hepatitis, and pulmonary edema. Microscopically, the main lesion was a multifocal vacuolar degeneration and necrosis of randomly distributed small groups of hepatocytes with presence of apoptotic and multinucleated syncytial cells. Necrotic foci were also found in the lungs as well as a hemorrhagic, granulomatous, and heterophilic cellulitis and myositis of the neck and a generalized depletion and lymphocytolysis of lymphoid organs. At 8 days of age, birds also began to show hock swelling histologically characterized by a fibrinoleucocytic inflammation of the articulation and tendon sheaths, with hyperplasia of the synovial membrane, and lymphoplasmocytic infiltration...
2055231131	In order to study the phylogeny of Aegilops mutica in the genera of Triticum and Aegilops, variations in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA regions were investigated by polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformational polymorphism (PCR-SSCP) analysis. Nine lines, each of Ae. mutica and Ae. speltoides, were studied together with nine other Triticum and Aegilops species, including T. aestivum. By analyzing 9.7-kb chloroplast and 13.1-kb mitochondrial DNA regions, a total of 268 bands were detected, of which 176 (65.7%) showed variation within and/or between species. The level of intraspecific variation of Ae. mutica was lower than that of Ae. speltoides. The low level of the intraspecific variation of Ae. mutica was contrary to the expectation from previous studies on morphological and cytolo-gical characters. In the phylogenetic trees based on SSCP, Ae. mutica, Ae. speltoides and the other four species of the section Sitopsis (the subsection Emarginata) were separated into three different clusters. In addition, T. aestivum was included in the cluster of Ae. speltoides in the phylogenetic trees. This result suggests that Ae. speltoides is the cytoplasmic donor of common wheat.
2055231165	The mutagenicity of an oxidized form of dGTP, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine 5'-triphosphate (8-OH-dGTP), was examined using human 293T cells. Shuttle plasmid DNA containing the supF gene was first transfected into the cells, and then 8-OH-dGTP was introduced by means of osmotic pressure. The DNAs replicated in the cells were recovered and then transfected into Escherichia coli. 8-OH-dGTP induced A:T-->C:G substitution mutations in the cells. The knock-downs of DNA polymerases eta and zeta, and REV1 by siRNAs reduced the A:T-->C:G substitution mutations, suggesting that these DNA polymerases are involved in the misincorporation of 8-OH-dGTP opposite A in human cells. In contrast, the knock-down of DNA polymerase iota did not affect the 8-OH-dGTP-induced mutations. The decrease in the induced mutation frequency was more evident by double knock-downs of DNA pols eta plus zeta and REV1 plus DNA pol zeta (but not by that of DNA pol eta plus REV1), suggesting that REV1-DNA pol eta and DNA pol zeta work in different steps. These results indicate that specialized DNA polymerases are involved in the mutagenesis induced by the oxidized dGTP.
2055231230	The cellulase enzyme system consists of cellobiohydrolase, endoglucanase, and beta-glucosidase and has been extensively studied with respect to its biosynthesis, properties, mode of action, application, and, most recently, secretion mechanisms. A knowledge of the factors governing the biosynthesis and secretion of these enzymes at the molecular level will be useful in maximizing enzyme productivity in extracellular fluid. Among other topics, the regulatory effects of sorbose (a noninducing sugar which is not a product of cellulose hydrolysis) on cellulase synthesis and release are described. Cellulase genes have recently been cloned into a number of microorganisms with a view to understanding the gene structure and expression and to obtaining the enzyme components in pure form. The factors governing biosynthesis and secretion of cellulases in recombinant cells are also discussed. Cellulases are known to be glycoproteins, therefore, the role of O- and N-linked glycosylation on enzyme stability and secretion is also detailed.
2055231253	Clathrin-dependent endocytosis allows cells to bring plasma membrane and extracellular molecules into the cell. Forming a clathrin-coated vesicle requires the sequential action of numerous factors, beginning with endocytic adaptors. Adaptors are thought to initiate the process in two ways: by selecting cargo for packaging into the vesicle and assembling the clathrin coat and other components necessary to shape the vesicle. Here, we review recent work focusing on the sequential and cooperative interactions of adaptors with their binding partners, and how adaptors contribute to initial stages of endocytic internalization. The regulation of adaptors might be a key step for controlling endocytosis, and thus aid in homeostasis and cell physiology.
2055231278	Abstract We have cloned a thyroid-stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) cDNA from mouse thyroid glands. The sequence of this cDNA indicated that it encoded a 739 amino acid TSHR splice variant that lacked exon 5 (TSHR 739 ). In thyroid gland samples from adult mice, the amount of TSHR 739 mRNA was about 10% of the amount of full-length TSHR (TSHR 764 ) mRNA. A eCFP-tagged TSHR 739 integrated into plasma membrane, but lacked TSH binding activity and it did not produce cAMP in response to TSH. However, thyroid-stimulating antibodies from patients with Graves' disease stimulated cAMP production in HEK293 cells that expressed TSHR 739 . Quantitative PCR revealed that TSHR 739 transcript levels were low in the fetal mouse thyroid samples, but TSHR 739 transcript levels increased after birth and as the mice grew. We used plasmid injection combined with electroporation into skeletal muscles to immunize BALB/c mice with TSHR 739 , TSHR 764, , or control plasmid; TSHR 739 caused goiters, high 125 I uptake activity, thyrotoxicosis, and production of thyroid-stimulating antibodies, but TSHR 764 , or control did not. These results indicated that immunization with an autologous TSHR antigen, TSHR 739 , induced Graves'-like disease in mice, and that TSHR 739 is a candidate autoantigen in autoimmune thyroid disease.
2055231308	We investigated whether the inhibition of milk ejection during and/or between machine milkings is responsible for the low milk fat observed in commercial milk obtained from dairy ewes managed with a mixed system (MIX) of partial daily suckling (10 h) and once daily machine milking (after 14 h of udder filling). East Friesian crossbred dairy ewes were randomly allocated postpartum to the MIX system (n = 9) or to exclusive twice-daily machine milking (DY1, n = 8). Following wk 4, MIX ewes were permanently weaned from their lambs and milked twice daily. All ewes were injected with saline, oxytocin, or an oxytocin-receptor antagonist prior to three morning milkings during wk 2, 4, and 6 of lactation to study cisternal and alveolar milk distribution. Overall milk yield (cisternal + alveolar) for MIX ewes was 42% greater than for DY1 ewes during wk 2 and 4, which demonstrates the beneficial effect of lamb suckling on milk production of dairy ewes. However, during normal machine milking, only the cisternal fraction was obtained from MIX ewes, confirming that milk ejection did not occur for as long as these ewes remained in partial daily contact with their lambs. Although the volume of milk stored within the cistern, and its concentration of milk protein was similar for the two weaning systems, milk of MIX ewes was significantly inferior in cisternal milk fat concentration and yield compared to DY1 ewes. This provides evidence that not only is there inhibition of milk ejection during machine milking of MIX ewes, there is additional inhibition of transfer of milk fat, but not milk protein, from the alveoli to the cistern during the evening when MIX ewes are separated from their lambs. Following weaning of MIX ewes, the majority of lactation traits studied were similar compared to DY1 ewes.
2055231351	The light demands of seaweeds is an interesting and rather complex phenomenon because they depend not only on the species but also on their different development stages. Even different parts of the same plant sometimes have different light demands. Light control is an important procedure at large scaleLaminaria nursery stations in China. Technicians and scientists have different viewpoints on the best method to regulate light. A culture study onLaminaria japonica starting from zoospores to several centimeter sporophytes to find the optimal and critical irradiance ranges for juvenileLaminaria at different development stages added more knowledge on this aspect. Experiment results show gametophytes can not tolerate irradiance of more than 150 μE m−2s−1 while sporophytes can tolerate more than 519 μE m−2s−1. This big difference starts from the very early stage of 1-to 2-celled sporophytes. The biological basis and mechanism of this phenomenon need further research.
2055231385	Due to the increase in international trade in seafood and seafood products, authentication has become a necessity. Authentication can either be done by generating species-specific protein profiles or DNA profiles. Use of PCR-based techniques has been studied since they are reliable, reproducible and low cost and they enable construction of worldwide databanks. Techniques like FINS (forensically informative nucleotide sequencing), RFLP (restriction fragment length polymorphism), SSCP (single-stranded conformational polymorphism), RAPD and LP-RAPD (long-primer random amplified polymorphic DNA) and AFLP (amplified fragment length polymorphism) all can contribute to establishment of methods for authentication.
2055231403	Lipid A is the essential component of endotoxin (Gram-negative lipopolysaccharide), a potent immunostimulatory compound. As the outer surface of the outer membrane, the details of lipid A structure are crucial not only to bacterial pathogenesis but also to membrane integrity. This work characterizes the structure of lipid A in two psychrophiles, Psychromonas marina and Psychrobacter cryohalolentis, and also two mesophiles to which they are related using MALDI-TOF MS and fatty acid methyl ester (FAME) GC-MS. P. marina lipid A is strikingly similar to that of Escherichia coli in organization and total acyl size, but incorporates an unusual doubly unsaturated tetradecadienoyl acyl residue. P. cryohalolentis also shows structural organization similar to a closely related mesophile, Acinetobacter baumannii, however it has generally shorter acyl constituents and shows many acyl variants differing by single methylene (-CH2-) units, a characteristic it shares with the one previously reported psychrotolerant lipid A structure. This work is the first detailed structural characterization of lipid A from an obligate psychrophile and the second from a psychrotolerant species. It reveals distinctive structural features of psychrophilic lipid A in comparison to that of related mesophiles which suggest constitutive adaptations to maintain outer membrane fluidity in cold environments.
2055231438	Abstract The propensity of neurons to undergo profound and precipitous depolarization is believed to contribute to their characteristic vulnerability to hypoxic injury. The length of time a neuron spends in a depolarized state following hypoxic depolarization (HD) is a critical determinant of the extent of irreversible cell damage. It is less clear, however, what the effects of moderate hypoxia are when HD does not occur. The present study examined the effects of prolonged, moderate hypoxia which does not elicit HD in rat hippocampal slices. Extracellularly-recorded population excitatory postsynaptic potentials (pEPSPs) in stratum radiatum of CA1 were eliminated 10–15 min after initiating hypoxia. Physiological damage was related to the hypoxic duration: full, intermediate, or poor recovery of pEPSP slope was observed after 30, 60, or 120 min of hypoxia, respectively. The glutamate receptor antagonists, d,l -2-amino-5-phosphono-valeric acid (APV) or 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), enhanced the post-hypoxic recovery of synaptic responses. These findings demonstrate that profound HD is not necessary to elicit physiological damage during moderate hypoxia; moreover, the neuroprotective actions of excitatory transmitter antagonists are not limited to their capacity to delay HD. The precise characterization of cellular responses under these conditions will be of particular importance for understanding the pathophysiology of an ischemic penumbra.
2055231449	The VP24 protein of Ebola virus is believed to be a secondary matrix protein and minor component of virions. In contrast, the VP40 protein of Ebola virus is the primary matrix protein and the most abundant virion component. The structure and function of VP40 have been well characterized; however, virtually nothing is known regarding the structure and function of VP24. Wild-type and mutant forms of VP24 were expressed in mammalian cells to gain a better understanding of the biochemical and functional nature of this viral protein. Results from these experiments demonstrated that (i) VP24 localizes to the plasma membrane and perinuclear region in both transfected and Ebola virus-infected cells, (ii) VP24 associates strongly with lipid membranes, (iii) VP24 does not contain N-linked sugars when expressed alone in mammalian cells, (iv) VP24 can oligomerize when expressed alone in mammalian cells, (v) progressive deletions at the N terminus of VP24 resulted in a decrease in oligomer formation and a concomitant increase in the formation of high-molecular-weight aggregates, and (vi) VP24 was present in trypsin-resistant virus like particles released into the media covering VP24-transfected cells. These data indicate that VP24 possesses structural features commonly associated with viral matrix proteins and that VP24 may have a role in virus assembly and budding.
2055231513	The proteinase of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1 protease) is an obvious example of a receptor for which drug design methodologies have been successfully applied. In this article, Michael West and David Fairlie outline the specific progress made to date towards the rational design of protease inhibitors as anti-HIV drugs, and compare their pharmacological profiles. The rationale employed in designing protease inhibitors illustrates evolving trends in drug design, problems in comparing assay data, and obstacles to developing enzyme inhibitors into drugs.
2055231554	AbstractObjectives: The purpose of the study was to establish a suitable model to study Parkinson’s disease (PD) pathogenesis in differentiated dopaminergic neurons (dDCN). The specific aim was to demonstrate the involvement of the caspase family and to identify specific caspases which are activated by 6-hydroxydopamine (6OHD) treatment leading to death of dDCN.Methods: ReNcell VM cells were differentiated into dDCN and were exposed to 6OHD to induce stress. Western blot (WB) and double immunofluorescent analyses of caspases-2, -3, and -8 were carried out in untreated and 6OHD-treated dDCN. zVADfmk was used to determine if it could inhibit activation of caspases-2, -3, and -8 in dDCN following 6OHD-mediated stress.Results: Our immunofluorescent and WB data showed that 6OHD triggered caspases-2 and -8 activation which in turn activated caspase-3 leading to death of dDCN. Additionally, WB analysis revealed that caspases-2, -3, and -8 activation was reduced by zVADfmk in 6OHD-treated cells.Discussion: The st...
2055231592	The in vitro temperature inactivation of the electron transport system (ETS) activity was measured for 11 phytoplankton species. The average inactivation temperature is between 18–23 C, but exceptions with inactivation temperatures as high as 43 C were noted for a tide pool phytoplankton, Dunaliella tertiolecta Butcher. Despite differences in temperatures at which the ETS activity begins to decrease, experimental values for the energies of activation (E) of electron transport are very similar and average ca. 12 kcal/mol. The results show the necessity of applying temperature corrections to in vitro ETS activity measurements when oceanic in situ oxygen consumption is computed from ETS activity measurements. The progress of thermal inactivation of the ETS activity in phytoplankton species studied yields biphasic curves. The biphasic nature of the curves is expressed when using both relatively high and low temperature of inactivation and in more or less heat sensitive species. These curves are described in terms of microsomal and mitochondrial substrate dependence. Based on the obtained temperature response of the ETS activity, the adaption of phytoplankton species to growth temperature is discussed.

2055231614	Abstract Error-prone polymerase chain reactions (epPCRs) are often used to introduce mutations in random mutagenesis, which has been used as a tool in protein engineering. Here, we developed a new method of epPCR using heavy water as a solvent instead of normal water (H 2 O). Rhodopsin cDNA of the Ayu fish ( Plecoglossus altivelis ) was used as a template and was amplified using five different conditions: (A) 100% H 2 O with no Mn 2+ , (B) 100% H 2 O/0.6 mM Mn 2+ , (C) 99% D 2 O with no Mn 2+ , (D) 99% D 2 O/0.6 mM Mn 2+ and (E) 99% H 2 18 O with no Mn 2+ . The 13,960 (for each of the conditions A to D) and 33,504 (for condition E) base pairs were sequenced. A maximum error rate of 1.8 × 10 −3  errors/bp was detected in condition D, without any particular hot-spot mutations. A high preference for AT → GC transitions was observed in condition D, whereas a high preference for transitions over transversions was observed in condition C. All of the mutations observed in condition E were transversions. When conditions A and C were applied to another template, the honeybee actin gene, the results were comparable to those for Ayu rhodopsin. Based on these results, the use of heavy water, instead of H 2 O, as a solvent for epPCR can introduce random mutations without positional bias, template dependency or decreased yield. Our new epPCR method, and possibly combining the use of D 2 O and H 2 18 O, may be a powerful random mutagenesis technique.
2055231628	Summary Vertebrate circadian rhythms are organized by the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Despite its physiological importance, SCN development is poorly understood. Here, we show that Lim homeodomain transcription factor 1 (Lhx1) is essential for terminal differentiation and function of the SCN. Deletion of Lhx1 in the developing SCN results in loss of SCN-enriched neuropeptides involved in synchronization and coupling to downstream oscillators, among other aspects of circadian function. Intact, albeit damped, clock gene expression rhythms persist in Lhx1-deficient SCN; however, circadian activity rhythms are highly disorganized and susceptible to surprising changes in period, phase, and consolidation following neuropeptide infusion. Our results identify a factor required for SCN terminal differentiation. In addition, our in vivo study of combinatorial SCN neuropeptide disruption uncovered synergies among SCN-enriched neuropeptides in regulating normal circadian function. These animals provide a platform for studying the central oscillator's role in physiology and cognition.
2055231645	Of 38 patients with a Philadelphia-chromosome positive chronic myeloid leukaemia treated with recombinant interferon alpha (rIFN-alpha) 2a or 2b and monitored for emergence of IFN-antibodies in their sera 11 patients developed rIFN-alpha 2 binding and 10 rIFN-alpha 2 neutralizing antibodies. rIFN-alpha neutralizing antibody positive patients experienced significantly (P less than 0.025) more clinical relapses (6/10) than IFN-antibody negative patients (6/28) during continuous IFN-therapy. Furthermore, IFN-antibody-positive patients with titre above 400 INU/ml were more likely to relapse under rIFN-alpha-therapy than IFN-antibody-negative patients with titre below 400 INU/ml (P less than 0.05). Seven rIFN-antibody-positive patients experiencing a clinical relapse or a primary non-responsiveness were treated with two- to three-fold increased doses of rIFN-alpha 2. Only one of these seven patients developed a partial haematological remission upon intensification of the rIFN-alpha 2 therapy. Consecutively, the six patients failing high dose rIFN-alpha treatment were switched to a natural IFN-alpha preparation (3 x 9 x 10(6) I.U. weekly s.c.). Under such treatment two of the six patients achieved a long-lasting complete, one a partial haematological remission. In high-titred IFN-antibody positive patients significantly altered serum-IFN-titre and minimal IFN-inducible Mx-homologue concentrations were measured; in contrast, nIFN-alpha induced normal IFN-titre and dose-equivalent Mx-homologue amounts in these patients. The data prove that high-titred rIFN-alpha neutralizing antibodies abrogate the biological action of rIFN-alpha, but not of nIFN-alpha in vivo and explains why nIFN-alpha can be effective in the anti rIFN-alpha 2 positive patients.
2055231692	The intracellular nonlysosomal calcium-dependent cysteine protease, m-calpain, is shown to specifically cleave the bHLHzip transcription factor USF leaving the binding and dimerisation domains intact. The resultant protein is capable of efficient DNA binding but is no longer able to activate transcription. A surprisingly high proportion of other transcription factors tested, AP1 (c-Fos/c-Jun), Pit-1, Oct-1, CP1a and b, c-Myc, ATF/CREB, AP2 and AP3 but not Sp1, were similarly cleaved by m-calpain to produce specific partial digestion products. These properties make m-calpain a particularly useful protease for proteolytic studies of transcription factors and also raise the possibility that m-calpain may be involved in vivo in regulation of turnover or transcriptional activity of a number of transcription factors.
2055231699	Type I interferons display a broad range of immunomodulatory functions. Interferon β increases gene expression at the transcriptional level through binding of factors to the interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE) within the promoters of interferon-inducible genes, such as HLA class I. Despite mutation of the class I ISRE sequence within the nonclassical HLA-G class I gene promoter, we show that interferon β enhances both transcription and cell surface expression of HLA-G in trophoblasts and amniotic and thymic epithelial cells that selectively express it in vivo. Deletion and mutagenesis analysis of a putative interferon-regulatory factor (IRF)-1 binding site within the HLA-G promoter show that HLA-G transactivation is mediated through an ISRE sequence 746 base pairs upstream from ATG, which is distinct from the interferon-responsive element described within proximal classical class I gene promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift analysis and supershift analysis further demonstrate that interferon-responsive transcription factors, including IRF-1, specifically bind to the HLA-G ISRE. Our results provide evidence that IRF-1 binding to a functional ISRE within the HLA-G promoter mediates interferon β-induced expression of the HLA-G gene. These observations are of general interest considering the implication of HLA-G in mechanisms of immune escape involved in fetal-maternal tolerance and other immune privilege situations.
2055231726	The greater severity of the graft-versus-host (GVH) reaction induced by grafting C57BL/6(B6) lymphoid or bone marrow cells to irradiated (B6 x DBA/2)F1 recipients, as compared to that induced in H-2-identical (B6 x BALB/c)F1 recipients, has been shown to arise from a synergistic effect of H-2d and DBA/2 minor histocompatibility antigens (MiHAs), and not from a difference in the intensity of genetic resistance to B6 cell grafts exhibited by the two F1s. Furthermore, detection of such synergistic effects depends upon choice of an appropriate assay system; GVH splenomegaly results cannot be used to predict the outcome of a systemic GVH reaction.
2055231816	This study reports on the in vitro egg hatching, exsheathment, migratory activity, and sensitivity to anthelmintics of Ascaris suum larvae in cultures with or without bovine bile. Three methods for egg hatching and/or incubation were used: an object-glass method, a glass-bead method, and an incubation method. An agar migration assay (AMA) was developed to test the migratory activity of Ascaris larvae following hatching. Bile appeared to be an important stimulatory factor for both egg hatching and larval mobility in the incubation method. Incubation in low concentrations of bile (2%, 5%, or 10%) stimulated both egg hatching and larval migration, whereas concentrations of at least 20% impaired egg hatching and larval migration. Furthermore, 5% bile seemed to promote exsheathment of A. suum larvae.
2055231832	Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Breast cancer prognosis is particularly poor in case of tumors overexpressing the oncoprotein HER2/neu. A new nanobioconjugate of the Polycefin(TM) family of anti-cancer drugs based on biodegradable and non-toxic polymalic acid (PMLA) was engineered for a multi-pronged attack on HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells. An antibody-cytokine fusion protein consisting of the immunostimulatory cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) genetically fused to an antibody specific for human HER2/neu [anti-HER2/neu IgG3-(IL-2)] was covalently attached to the PMLA backbone to target HER2/neu expressing tumors and ensure the delivery of IL-2 to the tumor microenvironment. Antisense oligonucleotides (AON) were conjugated to the nanodrug to inhibit the expression of vascular tumor protein laminin-411 in order to block tumor angiogenesis. It is shown that the nanobioconjugate was capable of specifically binding human HER2/neu and retained the biological activity of IL-2. We also showed the uptake of the nanobioconjugate into HER2/neu-positive breast cancer cells and enhanced tumor targeting in vivo. The nanobioconjugate exhibited marked anti-tumor activity manifested by significantly longer animal survival and significantly increased anti-HER2/neu immune response in immunocompetent mice bearing D2F2/E2 murine mammary tumors that express human HER2/neu. The combination of laminin-411 AON and antibody-cytokine fusion protein on a single polymeric platform results in a new nanobioconjugate that can act against cancer cells through inhibition of tumor growth and angiogenesis and the orchestration of an immune response against the tumor. The present Polycefin(TM) variant may be a promising agent for treating HER2/neu expressing tumors and demonstrates the versatility of the Polycefin(TM) nanobioconjugate platform.
2055231839	The effects of arsenite on activities of several enzymes including mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), microsomal cytochrome P450 and b5, NAD(P)H cytochrome C reductase and glutathione S-transferase were studied. The effects of arsenite on the mitochondrial membrane lipid peroxidation (LPO), the content of hepatic cytosol reduced glutathione and the activity of glutathione peroxidase was also investigated in rats. The results indicated that the activities of mitochondrial PDH and SDH were inhibited to 59 % and 57 % of the control activities respectively after arsenite was administered by intraperitoneal injection (i. p.) for 7 consecutive days at a dose of 20 mg/kg. Administration of arsenite led to a potential decrease of GSH content. The increase in lipid peroxidation of liver mitochondrial membrane prepared from rats treated with arsenite was also observed (P<0. 05). Arsenite did not appear to affect the liver cytosolic glutathione peroxidase and microsomal enzyme activitiesin vivo. Inin vitro test, liver mitochondria and cytosol were treated with arsenite, which led to a decreased SDH activity and GSH content and increase of mitochondrial LPO in a dose-dependent pattern that was similar to the results obtained inin vitro experiments. Selenite played a significant antagonistic role in effects of arsenite eitherin vivo orin vitro on the activities of mitochondrial PDH and SDH, and the content of mitochondrial LPO and cytosolic GSH. This results suggested that the toxic effects of arsenite on rat were associated with increased levels of LPO and the injured SH group in body caused by arsenite.
2055231842	Studies were conducted to determine the effects of aging on certain biochemical and biophysical properties of the hepatic microsomes and on the kinetic properties of a constituent drug-metabolizing enzyme and a heme protein in a nonhuman primate. Outbred male and female rhesus monkeys (Macaque mulatta) ranging in age from 1 to 25 years were employed as animal models. There was considerable individual variability, but no significant age or sex-related changes in (1) the concentration of microsomal protein or (2) the content of the cytochromes P-450. Although the oldest animals examined for NADPH cytochrome c (P-450) reductase activity were only 19 years of age, the specific activity of this important enzyme increased rather than decreased during aging. There were only minor changes in the total phospholipid content of the microsomes and none in the distribution profile of the major phospholipid classes. However, the microsomal cholesterol content increased sufficiently to cause a rise in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio between 16 and 25 years of age. The fluidity of the membrane lipid domain exhibited a concomitant decline as measured by electron spin resonance spectroscopy. There was no apparent correlation between age-related changes in these physicochemical properties of the microsomes and the in vitro activities of the constituent drug-metabolizing enzymes or heme proteins. Furthermore, the marked disparities between the data obtained in inbred male rodents and those from outbred primates suggest that the extrapolation of the former to humans is of questionable value with respect to liver drug metabolism.
2055231899	In the present study, we describe the neurochemical effects of intranigral injections of colchicine in the rat forebrain using immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. The observations on the injected side are compared to the contralateral one and to the sham-operated rats. We demonstrate that such injections are able to strongly enhance the immunoreactivity for Met-enkephalin (ME), substance P (SP) and neuropeptide Y (NPY) in numerous nerve cell bodies of the limbic system (injected side), whereas the levels of the corresponding mRNAs are differently modified according to the region examined. A clear correlation between the enhancement of the immunostaining for ME and SP and that of the preproenkephalin (PPA) and preprotachychinin gene transcripts was observed in neuronal perikarya of the medial amygdaloid nucleus (SP), of the dorsolateral hypothalamus (ME) and of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus (SP). These observations are interpreted as an induction--or increased expression--of neuropeptide genes in neuronal perikarya postsynaptic to nerve fibers originating in the midbrain and brain stem. In this case, colchicine is thought to block the electrophysiological activity of ascending nerve fibers (anterograde and postsynaptic effect). In the case where the enhancement of the immunoreactivity for the studied neuropeptides was associated with no change or a decreased expression of the corresponding genes in the same brain areas, colchicine may have blocked the axoplasmic transport of peptides in nerve fibers projecting to the midbrain and/or brain stem (6). This may result in a retrograde accumulation of peptides in the nerve cell bodies of origin and, eventually, in a negative feedback regulation of the corresponding encoding genes in these perikarya (retrograde and presynaptic effect of colchicine). The drastic behavioral effects of bilateral intranigral injections of colchicine, on ingestive behavior in particular, have been studied in a following paper.
2055231912	Cross-sectional studies have associated short telomere length with smoking, body weight, physical activity, and possibly alcohol intake; however, whether these associations are due to confounding is unknown. We tested these hypotheses in 4,576 individuals from the general population cross-sectionally, and with repeat measurement of relative telomere length 10 years apart. We also tested whether change in telomere length is associated with mortality and morbidity in the general population. Relative telomere length was measured with quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Cross-sectionally at the first examination, short telomere length was associated with increased age (P for trend across quartiles = 3×10−77), current smoking (P = 8×10−3), increased body mass index (P = 7×10−14), physical inactivity (P = 4×10−17), but not with increased alcohol intake (P = 0.10). At the second examination 10 years later, 56% of participants had lost and 44% gained telomere length with a mean loss of 193 basepairs. Change in leukocyte telomere length during 10 years was associated inversely with baseline telomere length (P<1×10−300) and age at baseline (P = 1×10−27), but not with baseline or 10-year inter-observational tobacco consumption, body weight, physical activity, or alcohol intake. Prospectively during a further 10 years follow-up after the second examination, quartiles of telomere length change did not associate with risk of all-cause mortality, cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus, ischemic cerebrovascular disease, or ischemic heart disease. In conclusion, smoking, increased body weight, and physical inactivity were associated with short telomere length cross-sectionally, but not with telomere length change during 10 years observation, and alcohol intake was associated with neither. Also, change in telomere length did not associate prospectively with mortality or morbidity in the general population.
2055231943	A plasma membrane-enriched fraction was isolated from various tissues of developing lima bean seedlings, Phaseolus lunatus var Cangreen, to study β-1,3-glucan synthase activity changes. All tissues contained an active β-glucan synthase, including the cotyledons that will be senescent in mature lima bean plants. Young primary leaves exhibited a very active β-glucan synthase; but this activity dropped markedly, about fivefold, as the leaves gained weight and became photosynthetic. Some tissues, such as the hypocotyl and young stem, exhibited an increase in β-glucan synthase activity as the tissues were growing and a decrease as the growth rate slowed. Roots exhibited a high activity early in development that only decreased slightly, about 30%, as root growth increased. Surprisingly the senescent cotyledons contained an activity equivalent to some other tissues that was maintained over our measurement time of 21 days. Perhaps this callose synthesis activity is related to translocation processes as the cotyledons transfer their reserves to the growing seedling. We concluded that β-glucan synthase was not a good indicator of sink strength in these lima bean tissues. The plasma membrane fractions also were tested for other enzymes that might be present because an electron microscope study revealed a low contamination by other types of membranes. The membrane fractions had low but detectable activities of sucrose synthase, UDPglucose pyrophosphorylase, UDPase, alkaline invertase, and a general phosphatase; but these enzymes exhibited no consistent pattern(s) of activity change with plant development.
2055231994	The aim of this paper was to assess biodiversity among different habitats of an organic farm and the relationships between some soil properties, nematode taxonomic diversity, and soil food web condition. Eight habitats were studied in the farm: ponds, ditches, a riparian corridor, hedgerows, and four agricultural fields (mustard, oats, fallow, and legumes). The undisturbed riparian corridor had higher soil $${\text{NO}}_{\text{3}}^ - - {\text{N}}$$ and $${\text{NH}}_4^ + - {\text{N}}$$ concentrations, and potentially mineralizable N and higher abundances of bacterivore nematodes and longer food webs. Canonical correlation analysis showed associations between habitats and nematode trophic groups: predatory and bacterial-feeding nematodes in the riparian corridor and hedgerows, omnivore nematodes in the ponds and ditches, and fungal-feeding nematodes in the legume field. Soil chemical and physical properties mirrored the aboveground farm patterns and were more similar among habitats that were or had been cultivated, compared to the riparian corridor. Soil food web indices, based on functional analysis of nematode faunal composition, reflected the aboveground landscape heterogeneity. Discriminant analysis indicated that soil food web indices separated the two most disturbed habitats (ponds and tailwater ditches) from the two least disturbed habitats (the riparian corridor and hedgerows). The indices correlated with soil functioning as inferred by soil properties. Abundance of nematode taxa was not associated with aboveground landscape patterns. The complexity of the soil food web may have been influenced by (1) environmental factors that differed between years, (2) different time periods since disturbance in the various habitats, and (3) movement of nutrients and organisms by water flow between habitats in the farmscale.
2055232036	A recent survey of mangroves in New Caledonia located 7 taxa of the genus Rhizophora – with 6 coexisting in one estuary. This is arguably the greatest concentration of co-occurring Rhizophora taxa anywhere. Two are well-known mangrove species of the Indo West Pacific, R. stylosa and R. apiculata, and another, R. samoensis resembles the widespread Atlantic East Pacific species, R. mangle. The other four are hybrid intermediates, R. × lamarckii (= R. stylosa × R. apiculata), R. × selala (= R. stylosa × R. samoensis), and two previously undescribed combinations, R. × tomlinsonii (R. apiculata × R. samoensis) and R. samoensis var. neocaledonica (= R. samoensis × R. × selala). The new entities are unknown elsewhere. While R. × tomlinsonii is considered endemic to New Caledonia, R. samoensis var. neocaledonica may occur elsewhere based on the co-distribution of putative parental taxa. All seven Rhizophora are described with new observations on their morphology and ecology, distribution maps, plus a revised key for the region.
2055232044	Herbs are a rich source of bioactive phytochemicals such as carotenoids, which are known to exert various positive biological effects. However, there is very limited information in the literature regarding the content and bioavailability of carotenoids from commonly consumed herbs. Therefore, the objectives of the present study were first, to determine the carotenoid content of eight herbs namely basil (Ocimum basilicum), coriander (Coriandrum sativum), dill (Anethum graveolens), mint (Metha L.), parsley (Petroselinum crispum), rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis), sage (Salvia officinalis), and tarragon (Artemisia dracunculus L.); and second, to assess carotenoid bioaccessibility from these herbs using a simulated human in vitro digestion model. Carotenoid bioaccessibility is defined as the amount of carotenoids transferred to micelles after digestion when compared with the original amount present in the food. The content of individual carotenoids varied significantly among the herbs tested. Carotenoid bioaccessibility varied from 0 to 42.8%. Basil and coriander, and their respective micelles, contained the highest levels of β-carotene, β-cryptoxanthin, and lutein + zeaxanthin. Our findings show that herbs are rich sources of carotenoids and that these foods can significantly contribute to the intake of bioaccessible carotenoids.
2055232064	Blood sugar level and stabilimeter activity were measured in rats at several stages of food deprivation and water deprivation. Significant negative correlations between blood sugar level and activity were found in both food and water deprived Ss.
2055232073	When the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942 is deprived of an essential macronutrient such as nitrogen, sulfur or phosphorus, cellular phycobiliprotein and chlorophyll contents decline. The level of β-carotene declines proportionately to chlorophyll, but the level of zeaxanthin increases relative to chlorophyll. In nitrogen- or sulfur-deprived cells there is a net degradation of phycobiliproteins. Otherwise, the declines in cellular pigmentation are due largely to the diluting effect of continued cell division after new pigment synthesis ceases and not to net pigment degradation. There was also a rapid decrease in O2 evolution when Synechococcus sp. Strain PCC 7942 was deprived of macronutrients. The rate of O2 evolution declined by more than 90% in nitrogen- or sulfur-deprived cells, and by approximately 40% in phosphorus-deprived cells. In addition, in all three cases the fluorescence emissions from Photosystem II and its antennae were reduced relative to that of Photosystem I and the remaining phycobilisomes. Furthermore, state transitions were not observed in cells deprived of sulfur or nitrogen and were greatly reduced in cells deprived of phosphorus. Photoacoustic measurements of the energy storage capacity of photosynthesis also showed that Photosystem II activity declined in nutrient-deprived cells. In contrast, energy storage by Photosystem I was unaffected, suggesting that Photosystem I-driven cyclic electron flow persisted in nutrient-deprived cells. These results indicate that in the modified photosynthetic apparatus of nutrient-deprived cells, a much larger fraction of the photosynthetic activity is driven by Photosystem I than in nutrient-replete cells.

2055232089	Tumor development requires facilitative alterations in the stroma. In this issue of Cancer Cell , Nguyen et al. provide evidence that irradiation of mammary stroma drives accelerated development of mammary tumors that are more likely to be estrogen receptor-negative and implicate stromal production of transforming growth factor-β in this process.
2055232187	Daily exposure to stressful situations affects the health of humans and animals. It has been shown that psychological stress affects the immune system and can exacerbate diseases. Probiotics can act as biological immunomodulators in healthy people, increasing both intestinal and systemic immune responses. The use of probiotics in stress situations may aid in reinforcing the immune system. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of a probiotic bacterium on the gut immune system of mice that were exposed to an experimental model of stress induced by food and mobility restriction. The current study focused on immune cells associated with the lamina propria of the intestine, including CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, CD11b+ macrophages, CD11c+ dendritic cells, and IgA+ B lymphocytes, as well as the concentrations of secretory IgA (S-IgA) and cytokine interferon gamma (INF-γ in intestinal fluid. We also evaluated the probiotic's influence on the gut microbiota. Probiotic administration increased IgA producing cells, CD4+ cells in the lamina propria of the small intestine, and S-IgA in the lumen; it also reduced the levels of IFN-γ that had increased during stress and improved the intestinal microbiota as measured by an increase in the lactobacilli population. The results obtained from administration of the probiotic to stressed mice suggest that the use of food containing these microorganisms may work as a palliative to reinforce the immune system.
2055232282	An association between vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene polymorphisms and bone mass variance has been observed in adult populations. To analyze possible association between VDR genotype and growth, we studied 589 healthy infants who were homogeneous for age, diet, and vitamin D status. The Bsm I, TaqI, and ApaI alleles' frequencies and genotypes were similar to those reported for Caucasian populations. Variations in Bsm I polymorphism were not associated with calcium intakes nor with serum levels of calcium, 25-hydroxyvitamin D, 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D, or alkaline phosphatase activity. But, they were associated with differences in body size. At 2 yr, homozygote BB (BsmI site absent) girls had higher length, weight and body surface area, and inversely, BB boys had lower weight, body mass index and body surface area, than their respective bb counterparts. As a result, gender-related differences were observed in Bb and bb, but not in BB populations. This VDR genotypic effect was observed also at birth and at 10 months in the longitudinal analysis of 145 selected full-term babies homozygous for the Bsm I polymorphism. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that VDR genotype influences intrauterine and early postnatal growth, directly or via interactions with gender-related growth regulators.
2055232316	Mycoplasma bovis is a primary agent of mastitis, pneumonia and arthritis in cattle and the bacterium most frequently isolated from the polymicrobial syndrome known as bovine respiratory disease complex. Recently, M. bovis has emerged as a significant health problem in bison, causing necrotic pharyngitis, pneumonia, dystocia and abortion. Whether isolates from cattle and bison comprise genetically distinct populations is unknown. This study describes the development of a highly discriminatory multilocus sequencing typing (MLST) method for M. bovis and its use to investigate the population structure of the bacterium. Genome sequences from six M. bovis isolates were used for selection of gene targets. Seven of 44 housekeeping genes initially evaluated were selected as targets on the basis of sequence variability and distribution within the genome. For each gene target sequence, four to seven alleles could be distinguished that collectively define 32 sequence types (STs) from a collection of 94 cattle isolates and 42 bison isolates. A phylogeny based on concatenated target gene sequences of each isolate revealed that bison isolates are genetically distinct from strains that infect cattle, suggesting recent disease outbreaks in bison may be due to the emergence of unique genetic variants. No correlation was found between ST and disease presentation or geographic origin. MLST data reported here were used to populate a newly created and publicly available, curated database to which researchers can contribute. The MLST scheme and database provide novel tools for exploring the population structure of M. bovis and tracking the evolution and spread of strains.
2055232317	In ciliated mammalian cells, the precise migration of the primary cilium at the apical surface of the cells, also referred to as translational polarity, defines planar cell polarity (PCP) in very early stages. Recent research has revealed a co-dependence between planar polarization of some cell types and cilium positioning at the surface of cells. This important role of the primary cilium in mammalian cells is in contrast with its absence from Drosophila melanogaster PCP establishment. Here, we show that deletion of GTP-binding protein alpha-i subunit 3 (Gαi3) and mammalian Partner of inscuteable (mPins) disrupts the migration of the kinocilium at the surface of cochlear hair cells and affects hair bundle orientation and shape. Inhibition of G-protein function in vitro leads to kinocilium migration defects, PCP phenotype and abnormal hair bundle morphology. We show that Gαi3/mPins are expressed in an apical and distal asymmetrical domain, which is opposite and complementary to an aPKC/Par-3/Par-6b expression domain, and non-overlapping with the core PCP protein Vangl2. Thus G-protein-dependent signalling controls the migration of the cilium cell autonomously, whereas core PCP signalling controls long-range tissue PCP.
2055232383	Filarioid worms (Dirofilaria immitis, D. tenuis, Dipetalonema procyonis, and D. Ilewellyni) were discovered in raccoons (Procyon lotor) in Maryland. Raccoons were trapped in lowland, upland, and agricultural-residential areas, which were further classified as stream borders, poorly drained, and well drained. Data on incidence of D. Ilewellyni were analyzed on basis of host distribution within these areas to indicate type of habitat in which one might seek the vector. It was concluded that exposure takes place in the spring of the year. The arthropod found associated most often with the raccoon in spring was Ixodes texanus. Larvae of this tick which were fed on infected raccoons presented no evi- dence of development of the microfilariae. Feeding experiments were also conducted with mosquitoes: Aedes aegypti, A. canadensis, A. sollicitans, A. triseriatus, A. vexans, Culex pipiens, Anopheles punctipen- nis, and A. quadrimaculatus. Although microfilariae remained alive and active in the gut contents of all these mosquitoes for 2 days, only in Aedes aegypti did they enter the hemocele, but no developmental changes were noted and all microfilariae were dead by the eighth day. Although the intermediate host of D. llewellyni was not determined, evaluation of the accumulated data provides criteria for seeking the vector. It appeared unlikely that exposure of the raccoons took place in the den or that the filarioids were transmitted by an ectoparasite commonly found in raccoon dens. The data suggest that the vector is available only early in spring, although there are infected raccoons throughout the year. Prevalence in juveniles was 21 percent; in subadults, 64 percent; in adults, 87 percent.
2055232387	Abstract A diverse range of animals, including elasmobranchs and nonteleost fish, use passive electroreception to locate hidden prey. The Australian lungfish, Neoceratodus forsteri (Krefft 1870), has ampullary organs analogous in form to the electroreceptors of other nonteleost fish. Afferents from these ampullae project to regions in the brain that are known to process electrosensory information in other species, suggesting that N. forsteri possesses an electric sense that may be used during prey location. To explore this hypothesis directly, we first characterized food-locating behaviour in N. forsteri and then conducted an experiment designed to quantify the effects of manipulating electrical and olfactory stimuli from live prey. A small crayfish, Cherax destructor , was housed in a specially constructed chamber hidden beneath the substrate, which prevented emission of chemical, mechanical and visual cues, but allowed transmission of bioelectric fields. Control treatments included presentation of electrically shielded prey, a dead crayfish and an empty chamber. In some treatments, a competing olfactory signal was presented simultaneously at the other end of the test tank to assess the relative salience of this sensory modality. The lungfish responded to the crayfish in the unshielded chamber with accurate and sustained feeding movements, even with a competing olfactory signal. By contrast, the abolition of electrical cues in the three control treatments reduced the accuracy and frequency of feeding movements in the vicinity of the target chamber. These results show that N. forsteri is capable of perceiving the weak electric fields surrounding living animals, and suggest that it uses this information when foraging to locate prey hidden from view.
2055232398	Gnotobiotic calves given intramuscular injections of dexamethasone (DM, 0.5 mg kg−1 day−1) showed marked changes in haematological parameters including a neutrophilia and a lymphopaenia. Not only was there a reduction in the numbers of circulating mononuclear cells, but there was also a significant (P<0.01) decrease in the in vitro responsiveness of the remaining circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes to the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and poke-weed mitogen (PWM). Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form of T cell receptor, are CD2−, CD5+, CD8−, CD4− and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves.  In vitro studies in gnotobiotic and conventional calves confirmed that DM was highly inhibitory for PHA responses but, in contrast to the in vivo findings, showed little effect of DM on ConA responses. Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively. These observations would suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in glucocorticosteroid suppression of the responses to these two mitogens.
2055232469	During locomotion, mammalian limb postures are influenced by many factors including the animal's limb length and body mass. Polk (2002) compared the gait of similar-sized cercopithecine monkeys that differed limb proportions and found that longer-limbed monkeys usually adopt more extended joint postures than shorter-limbed monkeys in order to moderate their joint moments. Studies of primates as well as non-primate mammals that vary in body mass have demonstrated that larger animals use more extended limb postures than smaller animals. Such extended postures in larger animals increase the extensor muscle mechanical advantage and allow postures to be maintained with relatively less muscular effort (Polk, 2002; Biewener 1989). The results of these previous studies are used here to address two anthropological questions. The first concerns the postural effects of body mass and limb proportion differences between australopithecines and members of the genus Homo. That is, H. erectus and later hominins all have larger body mass and longer legs than australopithecines, and these anatomical differences suggest that Homo probably used more extended postures and probably required relatively less muscular force to resist gravity than the smaller and shorter-limbed australopithecines. The second question investigates how animals with similar size but different limb proportions differ in locomotor performance. The effects of limb proportions on gait are relevant to inferring postural and locomotor differences between Neanderthals and modern Homo sapiens which differ in their crural indices and relative limb length. This study demonstrates that primates with relatively long limbs achieve higher walking speeds while using lower stride frequencies and lower angular excursions than shorter-limbed monkeys, and these kinematic differences may allow longer-limbed taxa to locomote more efficiently than shorter-limbed species of similar mass. Such differences may also have characterized the gait of Homo sapiens in comparison to Neanderthals, but more experimental data on humans that vary in limb proportions are necessary in order to evaluate this question more thoroughly.
2055232471	In the pancreas of Scyliorhinus stellaris large islets are usually found around small ducts, the inner surface of which is covered by elongated epithelial cells; thus the endocrine cells are never exposed directly to the lumen of the duct. Sometimes, single islet cells or small groups of endocrine elements are also incorporated into acini. Using correlative light and electron microscopy, eight islet cell types were identified:
2055232480	Zusammenfassung  Zum ersten Mal wurde in WHO/FAO Reference Brucellosis Laboratory, Weybridge, England, ein neuer Brucellaphag “Weybridge” von Brucella suis 1 isoliert, und zwar mittels der Methode nach Parnas.    Die bisher isolierten Brucellaphagen sind sehr charakteristisch: in verschiedenen Landern und von verschiedenen Serobiotypen der Brucellen isoliert, sind diese Phagen in ihrer Morphologie, Antigenitat und Serologie, in den Spectra der Brucellen-Lyse und in der Morphologie der negativen Kolonien monoton. Es scheint unmoglich zu sein, Gruppen von den Brucellaphagen zu differenzieren.    Summary  A new Brucellaphage “Weybridge” isolated from Brucella suis I    For the first time there was isolated, in the WHO/FAO Reference Brucellosis Laboratory, Weybridge, a new Brucellaphage “Weybridge” from the serobiotype Brucella suis 1 and by the method of Parnas.    The Brucellaphages isolated in different countries and from hitherto different serobiotypes of Brucellae are in their morphology, their antigenic-serologic structure, their Brucellae lysis spectrum as well as in their morphology of negative colonies, very uniform, it seems therefore to be impossible to differentiate any groups of Brucellaphages.
2055232500	Studies of cardiac muscle gene expression and signaling have been hampered by the lack of immortalized cardiomyocyte cell lines capable of proliferation and irreversible withdrawal from the cell cycle. With the goal of creating such cell lines, we generated transgenic mice using cardiac-specific cis-regulatory elements from the mouse Nkx2.5 gene to drive the expression of a simian virus 40 large T-antigen (TAg) gene flanked by sites for recombination by Cre recombinase. These transgenic mice developed tumors within the ventricular myocardium. Cells isolated from these tumors expressed cardiac markers and proliferated rapidly during serial passage in culture, without apparent senescence. However, they were unable to exit the cell cycle and failed to exhibit morphological features of terminal differentiation. Introduction of Cre recombinase to these cardiac cell lines by adenoviral delivery resulted in the elimination of TAg expression, accompanied by rapid cessation of cell division, and increase in cell size without an apparent induction of cellular differentiation. Incubation of cells lacking TAg in serum-deficient media with various pharmacological agents (norepinephrine, phenylephrine, or bone morphogenetic protein-2/4) or constitutively active calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase I and/or calcineurin led to the formation of sarcomeres and up-regulation of cardiac genes involved in excitation-contraction coupling. The combination of TAg expression under the control of an early cardiac promoter and Cre-mediated recombination allowed us to derive an immortal cell line from the ventricular myocardium that could be controllably withdrawn from the cell cycle. The conditional expression of TAg in this manner permits propagation and regulated growth termination of cell types that are otherwise unable to be maintained in cell culture and may have applications for cardiac repair technologies.
2055232504	Resume La peau et les muqueuses sont colonisees par un grand nombre de micro-organismes qui constituent la flore normale ou flore endogene. Cette flore est presente sur la peau, la cavite buccale, la gorge, le tractus digestif inferieur et la cavite vaginale. La grande majorite de ces micro-organismes sont des anaerobies stricts et dans les conditions usuelles ne sont pas pathogenes. Les infections a bacteries anaerobies se developpent apres une lesion de la barriere anatomique suivie d'une penetration de la flore normale dans un site sterile. Si les defenses naturelles de l'hote sont alterees, ces micro-organismes sont capables de provoquer une infection grave. II s'agit generalement d'une infection mixte associant bacteries aerobies et anaerobies, mais avec une predominance de bacteries anaerobies strictes. Tandis que la flore endogene est constituee de plusieurs centaines d'especes anaerobies, un nombre restreint d'especes seront isolees dans les suppurations. Les bacteries anaerobies isolees le plus frequemment dans les suppurations sont: Bacteroides fragilis, Prevotella pigmentees, Porphyromonas, Fusobacterium ou Peptostreptococcus . Ces bacteries doivent posseder un ou plusieurs facteurs de virulence.
2055232509	Tetraspanins compose a family of structurally related molecules with four transmembrane domains. A total of 33 tetraspanins are present in the human genome, and tetraspanins are also found in plants and certain fungi. A well-known property of tetraspanins is their ability to interact with one another and many other surface proteins, which led to the suggestion that they organize a network of molecular interaction referred to as the ‘tetraspanin web’, and that they play a role in membrane compartmentalization. Recent studies of the dynamics of these molecules provided important new information that helped refining the models of this ‘web’. Several genetic studies in mammals and invertebrates have demonstrated key physiological roles for some of the tetraspanins, in particular in immune response, sperm–egg fusion, photoreceptor function and the normal function of certain epitheliums or vascular development. However, in several examples, the phenotypes of tetraspanin-knockout mice are relatively mild or restricted to a particular organ, despite a wide tissue distribution.
2055232545	Unexperienced, experienced, hungry and fed experimental predators (rats, chickens, ducks) find juvenile metamorphosed fire salamanders, Salamandra salamandra, with functioning mucous and poison glands fully palatable; dogs, however, do refuse them. Most of the juveniles show a predator-avoidance behaviour by fleeing. The observations are discussed with regard to the possible natural predators of juvenile fire salamanders.
2055232603	Two formulations of bicyclohexy lammonium fumagillin, Fumagilin Band Fumidil B, were equally effective treatments for Nosema apis Zander infecting honey bees (Apis mellifera L.). Caged worker bees consumed either formulation in sucrose syrup as readily as syrup without fumagillin. Either formulation suppressed infection when fed with Nosema spores to caged workers for 7 d or when fed to workers for 3 d after they had consumed spores without fumagillin for 4 d. When consumed in sucrose syrup by bee colonies, neither fumagillin formulation significantly affected queen survival. More uncapped brood was reared by the colonies consuming fumagillin than those consuming syrup without fumagillin. Capped brood and total brood rearing was similar for colonies consuming fumagillin or syrup without fumagillin. Fumagilin B is more soluble in sucrose solution than Fumidil B, but both are easily prepared at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved level of 26 mg/liter in sucrose solution.
2055232669	The amygdala orchestrates the formation of behavioral responses to emotionally arousing stimuli. Many of these responses are initiated by the central nucleus, which converges information from other amygdaloid nuclei. Recently, we observed substantial projections from the amygdala to the amygdalostriatal transition area, which is located dorsal to the central nucleus. These projections led us to question whether the amygdalostriatal transition area has a role in the initiation of behavioral responses in emotionally arousing circumstances. To explore this anatomically, we traced the interconnections between the amygdalostriatal transition area and the amygdaloid complex using the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris-leucoagglutinin. The lateral (the medial division and the caudal portion of the dorsolateral division) and the accessory basal nuclei (the parvicellular division) provide moderate-to-heavy projections to the amygdalostriatal transition area. Projections back to the amygdala are light and are composed of thin, faintly stained varicose fibers that resemble the labeling of cholinergic terminals. The extra-amygdaloid outputs of the amygdalostriatal transition area are sparse and include moderate projections to the caudoventral globus pallidus, the ansa lenticularis, and the substantia nigra pars lateralis. These data suggest that the amygdalostriatal transition area is one of the major targets for projections originating in the lateral and accessory basal nuclei of the amygdala. Via these pathways, emotionally significant stimuli can evoke behavioral responses that are different from those initiated via projections from the amygdala to the central nucleus. One such candidate response is the orienting response (i.e., saccadic eye movements and head direction) in a pathway that includes a projection from the lateral/accessory basal nucleus of the amygdala to the amygdalostriatal transition area, and from there to the substantia nigra, pars lateralis.

2055232727	Abstract In this paper, evidence is provided that p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) exerts an opposite role on the cytotoxic function of β-amyloid (Aβ) depending on the different state of the peptide, fibrillar or oligomeric soluble form. Previous work in our laboratory has shown that the expression of p75NTR is required for cell death in vitro by Aβ peptides in fibrillar form (G. Perini, V. Della-Bianca, V. Politi, G. Della Valle, I. Dal-Pra, F. Rossi, U. Armato. Role of p75 neurotrophin receptor in the neurotoxicity by beta-amyloid peptides and synergistic effect of inflammatory cytokines. J. Exp. Med. 195 (2002) 907-918). In the present study, performed by using the same cell clones and procedures as in previous paper, we show that: (a) soluble oligomers of Aβ(1–42) exert a cytotoxic activity independent of p75NTR, (b) the expression of p75NTR exerts a protective role against the toxic activity of soluble oligomers, (c) this role is due to an active function of the juxtamembrane sequence of the cytoplasmic region of p75NTR and (d) the protective function is mediated by phosphatidylinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) activity.
2055232738	Abstract Sixteen vessels within the deep-set Hawaii-based tuna longline fleet tested the catch efficacy, fish size selectivity and survival on longline retrieval of large-size 18/0 circle hooks vs. Japanese style tuna hooks, size 3.6 sun and vs. size 9/0 “J” hooks. Vessels alternated hook types throughout the longline gear and maintained a 1:1 ratio of circle hooks to their existing tuna or J-hooks. Observers monitored a total of 1393 sets; 1182 sets were circle hooks vs. tuna hooks and 211 sets were circle hooks vs. J-hooks. The 18 most-caught species were analyzed representing 97.6% of the total catch by number. Two statistical methods were used to assess differences in catch (randomization test) or catch rate (generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs)). There were no significant catch or catch rate (catchability) differences among hook types for bigeye tuna ( Thunnus obesus ), the primary target species, with either statistical method. However, GLMMs indicated that catch rates on circle hooks were significantly lower for 16 and 8 species compared to tuna and J-hooks, respectively. There were no significant differences in mean length of bigeye tuna among hook comparisons. Caught condition at retrieval varied considerably among the 18 species. Large circle hooks had greater effects on catch rates than on fish size selectivity and fish survival. We contend that reduced catch rates are a function of 18/0 circle hook shape, where the minimum width (4.9 cm) was 57% and 25% wider than the Japanese tuna (3.1 cm) and J-hook (3.9 cm), respectively. In contrast to tuna hooks, large circle hooks have conservation potential for use in the world's pelagic tuna longline fleets for some highly migratory species, with catch rate reductions of 29.2–48.3% for billfish species and 17.1–27.5% for sharks.

2055232839	Abstract One hundred and eighty-four of the 250 estuaries in South Africa are currently classified as temporarily open/closed and close off from the sea during the dry season, under low river inflow. The subtropical Mdloti Estuary, on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast, is one of these systems and hardly any information is available on its meiofauna. The abundance, biomass, composition, and grazing impact of meiofauna, as well as the key environmental factors that affect these variables, were investigated with emphasis on the contrast between open and closed phases of the estuary. Microphytobenthic chlorophyll a concentrations varied between 1.4 to 480 mg m −2 . Meiofauna were composed of nematodes, harpacticoid copepods, crustacean nauplii, mites, turbellarians, polychaetes, oligochaetes, ostracods and chironomids. Total abundance of meiofauna showed large variability both spatially and temporally and ranged from 0.4 to 88×10 4 ind. m −2 . Nematodes, mites and harpacticoid copepods occurred more often than other groups in the sediment. Total meiofauna carbon biomass exhibited similar temporal as well as spatial patterns as abundance and varied from 0.5 to 440 mg C m −2 . A carbon-based grazing model, applied to the total meiofauna, provided estimates of potential daily ingestion rates ranging from 1.8 to 857 mg C m −2 . Nematodes, mites and harpacticoid copepods contributed the most to the total potential daily ingestion rate of meiofauna in the Mdloti Estuary. Potential ingestion rates, determined using allometric equations, showed that meiofauna consumed from 0.1 to 254% of the microphytobenthic standing stock. Overall, meiofauna were likely not food limited and grazing on microphytobenthos was low, averaging 11% for the whole survey. A principal component analysis, applied to the whole study area and sampling period, indicated that major variations in meiofaunal community are mainly controlled by temperature and the state of the estuary's mouth (i.e. open/closed). Typically, meiofauna abundance in the estuary peaked after periods of prolonged mouth closure and decreased dramatically after the breaching of the estuary at the mouth.
2055232859	Maize (Zea mays L.) stem is thought to function alternately as a net importing and net exporting organ during ontogeny, depending on whole plant photosynthetic source and sink status. The [(14)C]sucrose and [(14)C]glucose uptake capacity of stem tissues was investigated to increase our understanding of the transport factors which may influence sink status.Uptake from solutions containing up to 200 millimolar radiolabeled sugar showed that d-glucose uptake consisted of saturable and nonsaturable components, while sucrose uptake was primarily nonsaturable during the kernel-fill stages. l-Glucose uptake lacked the saturable component but both d and l isomers apparently had similar slopes for the nonsaturable component. Uptake was sensitive to inhibitors and temperature, and was increased slightly by lowered pH.The seasonal chronology for saturable uptake by isolated vascular bundles and associated pith revealed highest rates between anthesis and early kernel growth, corresponding with the stage when net sugar accumulation rates were highest. For isolated pith, the rates increased at the final stages of plant development.The rate of labeled l-glucose movement from vascular bundles into pith in isolated stem segments was greater at the silking stage than at later developmental stages, suggesting a lower resistance to diffusive transport from vascular bundles into pith at silking. Studies with stem plus ear explants showed that the capability for sugar transport from pith to vascular bundles and for phloem loading and export from the stem region was present throughout the developmental period from early kernel fill (milk) to late kernel fill (dent).
2055232908	Gynosaponins (Gypenosides) are major phyto-chemicals in Gynostemma pentaphyllum (Thunb.), with similarities to the ginsenosides present in Panax ginseng. Gynosaponins are classified as terpenoid compounds. In G. pentaphyllum, 25% of the total gynosaponins are similar to ginsenosides. In this study, we analyzed the transcriptional levels of the G. pentaphyllum genome to identify secondary metabolite genes. The complete transcriptomes for the roots and leaves were obtained using a GS-FLX pyro-sequencer. In total, we obtained 265,340 and all reads were well annotated according to biological databases. Using insilico analysis, 84% of sequence were well annotated and we obtained most of the secondary metabolite genes that represent mono-, di-, tri- and sesquiterpenoids. From our EST, most of the terpenoid genes were noted, among those few similar genes were studied in P. ginseng and these transcripts will help to characterize more triterpenoid genes in G. pentaphyllum. Also help to compare P. ginseng and G. pentaphyllum at transcriptome level.
2055232941	Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. In the United States, only one in six lung cancer patients survives five years after diagnosis. These statistics may improve if new therapeutic targets are identified. We previously reported that an enzyme of fatty acid metabolism, very long-chain acyl-CoA synthetase 3 (ACSVL3), is overexpressed in malignant glioma, and that depleting glioblastoma cells of ACSVL3 diminishes their malignant properties. To determine whether ACSVL3 expression was also increased in lung cancer, we studied tumor histologic sections and lung cancer cell lines. Immunohistochemical analysis of normal human lung showed moderate ACSVL3 expression only in bronchial epithelial cells. In contrast, all of 69 different lung tumors tested, including adeno-, squamous cell, large cell, and small cell carcinomas, had robustly elevated ACSVL3 levels. Western blot analysis of lung cancer cell lines derived from these tumor types also had significantly increased ACSVL3 protein compared to normal bronchial epithelial cells. Decreasing the growth rate of lung cancer cell lines did not change ACSVL3 expression. However, knocking down ACSVL3 expression by RNA interference reduced cell growth rates in culture by 65–76%, and the ability of tumor cells to form colonies in soft agar suspension by 65–80%. We also conducted studies to gain a better understanding of the biochemical properties of human ACSVL3. ACSVL3 mRNA was detected in many human tissues, but the expression pattern differed somewhat from that of the mouse. The enzyme activated long- and very long-chain saturated fatty acid substrates, as well as long-chain mono- and polyunsaturated fatty acids to their respective coenzyme A derivatives. Endogenous human ACSVL3 protein was found in a punctate subcellular compartment that partially colocalized with mitochondria as determined by immunofluorescence microscopy and subcellular fractionation. From these studies, we conclude that ACSVL3 is a promising new therapeutic target in lung cancer.
2055232977	The genomic library of alkalophilic thermophilic Bacillus was constructed in E.coli. A single recombinant [pATB 507 I] out of 10,000 colonies showed growth at 50 degrees C, which produced large, opaque and mucilaginous colonies on LB. The IMViC biochemical tests suggested that the strain was E.coli, and scanning electron microscopy revealed increased cell length. The plasmid DNA from the thermophilic recombinant showed multiple bands. The cured strain showed ampicillin resistance (10 micrograms/ml) and presence of insert DNA in the genome, as revealed by southern blot analysis. The thermophilic trait was transformable with 10(-4) frequency of expression amongst the pATB 507I transformants. The hybridization of E.coli genomic DNA with labeled genomic DNA from alkalophilic thermophilic Bacillus suggested that the genetic recombination(s) of the insert DNA was an essential prerequisite for expression of thermophilic trait. The conjugative plasmid (RP4) mediated mobilization of thermophilic trait resulted in thermophilic conjugants after 2 h incubation. Southern blot analysis revealed that a single locus [5.6 kb Bam HI fragment] was involved in the transfer of thermophilic trait.
2055233077	Natural history and immature stage morphology of the facultative myrmecophilous butterfly Parrhasius polibetes (Stoll) (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) are described and illustrated through both light and scanning electron microscopy. Larvae underwent four instars. At the third instar, the dorsal nectar organ became present and functional, and larvae were facultatively tended by several ant species, those also tending plants bearing extrafloral nectaries and honeydew-producing hemipterans. Larvae were florivorous and polyphagous at the species level, using at least 44 species of plants in 19 families. Most host plants (∼ 89%) had some type of ant-attractive features, such as extrafloral nectaries or ant-tended treehoppers. The host range of this butterfly species allows the use of floral resources throughout the year. Food sources that promote ant visitation, flower bud morphology and phenology appear to be related to the evolution and maintenance of polyphagy in this butterfly species.
2055233080	The material upon which this study is based was obtained from G. E. MacGinitie, of the California Institute of Technology. These trematodes were collected from sting rays on July 20, 1927, taken in Elkhorn Slough, a salt water estuary of Monterey Bay. The worms, both as alcoholic specimens and as balsam mounts, were referred to me in August, 1934. An examination of the material revealed two distinct genera of ectoparasitic trematodes belonging to rather widely separated families, Tristomidae Taschenberg (1879) and Udonellidae Van Beneden and Hesse (1863). The writer wishes to make grateful acknowledgement to Mr. MacGinitie for the privilege of examining and describing this material.
2055233164	We have developed a novel three-dimensional (3D) cellular microarray platform to enable the rapid and efficient tracking of stem cell fate and quantification of specific stem cell markers. This platform consists of a miniaturized 3D cell culture array on a functionalized glass slide for spatially addressable high-throughput screening. A microarray spotter was used to deposit cells onto a modified glass surface to yield an array consisting of cells encapsulated in alginate gel spots with volumes as low as 60 nL. A method based on an immunofluorescence technique scaled down to function on a cellular microarray was also used to quantify specific cell marker protein levels in situ. Our results revealed that this platform is suitable for studying the expansion of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells as they retain their pluripotent and undifferentiated state. We also examined neural commitment of mouse ES cells on the microarray and observed the generation of neuroectodermal precursor cells characterized by expression of the neural marker Sox-1, whose levels were also measured in situ using a GFP reporter system. In addition, the high-throughput capacity of the platform was tested using a dual-slide system that allowed rapid screening of the effects of tretinoin and fibroblast growth factor-4 (FGF-4) on the pluripotency of mouse ES cells. This high-throughput platform is a powerful new tool for investigating cellular mechanisms involved in stem cell expansion and differentiation and provides the basis for rapid identification of signals and conditions that can be used to direct cellular responses.
2055233188	Abstract p-fluorophenylalanine fed to adult male Drosophila subobscura in just sub-lethal doses does not reduce expectation of life. Labelling experiments have shown that the analogue is incorporated into protein in adult flies. The results suggest that “error catastrophes” in protein synthesis are not an important cause of ageing in Drosophila.

2055233231	The development of tolerance to a drug at the level of the neuron reflects a homeostatic mechanism by which neurons respond to perturbations of their function by external stimuli. Acute functional tolerance (AFT) to ethanol is a fast compensatory response that develops within a single drug session and normalizes neuronal function despite the continued presence of the drug. We performed a genetic screen to identify genes required for the development of acute functional tolerance to ethanol in the nematode C. elegans. We identified mutations affecting multiple genes in a genetic pathway known to regulate levels of triacylglycerols (TAGs) via the lipase LIPS-7, indicating that there is an important role for TAGs in the development of tolerance. Genetic manipulation of lips-7 expression, up or down, produced opposing effects on ethanol sensitivity and on the rate of development of AFT. Further, decreasing cholesterol levels through environmental manipulation mirrored the effects of decreased TAG levels. Finally, we found that genetic alterations in the levels of the TAG lipase LIPS-7 can modify the phenotype of gain-of-function mutations in the ethanol-inducible ion channel SLO-1, the voltage- and calcium-sensitive BK channel. This study demonstrates that the lipid milieu modulates neuronal responses to ethanol that include initial sensitivity and the development of acute tolerance. These results lend new insight into studies of alcohol dependence, and suggest a model in which TAG levels are important for the development of AFT through alterations of the action of ethanol on membrane proteins.
2055233235	The effect of phorbol esters was investigated on the down-regulation of protein kinase C (PKC) and on the release of [3H]norepinephrine (NE) in synaptosomes from the rat cerebrum. Treatment with 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (TPA) promoted the translocation of PKC activity in a P2 fraction from the cytosol to the membrane fraction and then its down-regulation, in a dose-dependent manner. TPA induced a rapid down-regulation of the type II(beta) and type III(alpha) subspecies, but did not change the activity of the type I(gamma) subspecies in the cytosolic fraction for at least 15 min. The gamma-subspecies was subsequently decreased at a slower rate. In the synaptosomes thus having only the gamma-subspecies, a subsequent dose of TPA could not enhance K(+)-evoked NE release, although, in the original synaptosomes, TPA was able to enhance K(+)-evoked NE release. Pretreatment with TPA did not alter the K(+)-evoked NE release itself. TPA was also found to enhance the K(+)-evoked NE release from synaptosomes prepared from both hippocampus, which express the gamma-subspecies of PKC at a negligible level, and cerebral cortex, which have a significant level of the gamma-subspecies, to the same degree. These results suggest that the gamma-subspecies of PKC does not participate in the TPA-enhanced K(+)-evoked NE release from synaptosomes.
2055233237	Investigations into the causes of variation in native bunchgrass distributions in California are constrained by the rarity of extant populations, their highly invaded nature, and their diverse and often unknown historical backgrounds. In addition, the correlates of success in California grassland restoration projects are rarely monitored. While controlling for seeding densities, we investigated correlates of establishment success for a mix of native bunchgrasses seeded into a non-native annual grassland with a history of agriculture and grazing in Yolo County, California. Six native grass species— blue wildrye (Elymus glaucus), big squirreltail (Elymus multisetus), Idaho fescue (Festuca idahoensis), California melicgrass (Melica californica), purple needlegrass (Nassella pulchra), and Sandberg bluegrass (Poa secunda)—were drill seeded in the fall of 1999. In order to minimize recruitment of non-native annual grass seed, the land was prepared with a spring burn and fall application of glyphosate prior to seeding. Through the third growing season, the cover of planted native grasses was significantly greater on north-facing slopes than on slopes with southern aspects. This was likely due to more mesic conditions on such sites rather than reduced competition with non-native plants. In the first growing season, distinct dense patches of filaree (Erodium botrys) became apparent. Native bunchgrasses overall, non-native grasses, and nonnative forbs all had significantly less cover inside these patches of filaree. Purple needlegrass was an exception to both of these trends, being insensitive to both aspect and filaree patches. These results reinforce the reputation of purple needlegrass as a species with wide ecological tolerance and excellent restoration potential.
2055233242	The RHD gene of D-negative Japanese individuals was analyzed to determine the causes of the D-negative phenotype. cDNAs prepared from reticulocytes were used for the sequencing of full length RH transcripts. Although the complete RHCE sequence was obtained from the cDNA clones of D-negative and RHD gene-positive (D-RHD +) individuals, the complete sequence of RHD was not. The longest sequence derived from RHD had exon 9 deleted. A synonymous one-point mutation, G1227A, at the 3′-end of exon 9 was found in the genomic DNA. The allele was shared by more than 90% (28/31) of D-RHD +individuals, most of whom had the Del phenotype. To distinguish the Del, allele from D-positive alleles, a multiplex PCR-SSP (sequence specific primer) method was designed.
2055233270	Abstract The chemokine receptor CXCR4 and its ligand SDF-1 are essential components of hematopoiesis, organogenesis and immunomodulation in mammalian species. We cloned a cDNA encoding CXCR4 homolog of sterlet ( Acipenser ruthenus ), a representative of chondrostean fishes. The deduced amino acid sequence of sterlet CXCR4 is almost equally distant from mammalian and teleost CXCR4 (66–68% identical residues). Percent identity with the other chemokine receptors varies in the 30–35% range. The CXCR4 sequences from the three phylogenetically diverged lineages were compared with the sequences of the other chemokine receptors to determine the CXCR4-specific structural elements that were conserved during vertebrate evolution. The characteristic residues and/or motifs are located predominantly in the intracellular and extracellular regions and in the third, fourth and fifth transmembrane domains. The data presented may be helpful for structure-function analysis of the CXCR4 ligand binding and signal transduction.
2055233276	"New data and historical evidence from our own and other laboratories are summarized and discussed bearing on several issues relating to mechanisms and processes involved in the formation of chromosomal aberrations following exposure to ionizing radiations. Specifically addressed are: (1) the lesions and processes affecting the appearance of chromatid-type and/or chromosome-type aberrations after radiation, (2) DNA double strand break rejoining processes and the restitution of breaks vs. the formation of exchanges, (3) the role of homologous recombinational repair in protecting cells from induction of chromatid-type aberrations after irradiation of late S/G2 cells, (4) the role of interphase chromatin structure and nuclear organization in aberration induction, (5) cellular responses for aberration induction in relation to their tissue context, and (6) approaches to the detection of aberrations previously known as ""cryptic""."
2055233360	Oxytocin probably plays a role as a neurotransmitter/neuromodulator in the hippocampus of the rat. Oxytocin binding sites are present in the subiculum and CA1 region and oxytocin can excite a class of CA1 nonpyramidal neurons. In the present work we characterized the effect of oxytocin on hippocampal synaptic transmission. Whole-cell recordings were obtained from pyramidal neurons, in conditions of nearly symmetrical chloride concentrations. The selective oxytocin receptor agonist, [Thr4,Gly7]-oxytocin (TGOT), caused an increase in the frequency and amplitude of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) in virtually all neurons. These peptide-enhanced IPSCs were blocked by bicuculline, but not by strychnine, and reversed near 0 mV, indicating that they were mediated by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)A receptors. On average, TGOT caused a nearly threefold increase in the frequency and almost a doubling in the amplitude of spontaneous IPSCs. TGOT did not influence the frequency and the amplitude of miniature IPSCs or spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), and had no effect on evoked IPSCs. The peptide did not affect the basic membrane properties of pyramidal neurons or their GABA sensitivity. Thus, TGOT facilitated inhibitory transmission by exerting an excitatory action on the soma and/or dendrites of GABAergic interneurons. Extracellular recordings were performed in interneurons located in various hippocampal strata. Their sensitivity to TGOT was compared to that of substance P (SP). Interneurons in stratum pyramidale were excited both by TGOT and by SP. By contrast, stratum radiatum interneurons responded to SP but not to TGOT. In stratum oriens, half of the interneurons responded to SP, but only a minority to TGOT. Thus, oxytocin-responsive interneurons appear to be preferentially located in close vicinity of pyramidal neurons.
2055233380	To meet the increasing global demand for soybeans for food and feed consumption, new high-yield varieties with improved quality traits are needed. To ensure the safety of the crop, it is important to determine the variation in seed proteins along with unintended changes that may occur in the crop as a result various stress stimuli, breeding, and genetic modification. Understanding the variation of seed proteins in the wild and cultivated soybean cultivars is useful for determining unintended protein expression in new varieties of soybeans. Proteomic technology is useful to analyze protein variation due to various stimuli. This short review discusses transgenic soybeans, different soybean proteins, and the approaches used for protein analysis. The characterization of soybean protein will be useful for researchers, nutrition professionals, and regulatory agencies dealing with soy-derived food products.
2055233461	The goal of brain drug targeting technology is the delivery of therapeutics across the blood-brain barrier (BBB), including the human BBB. This is accomplished by re-engineering pharmaceuticals to cross the BBB via specific endogenous transporters localized within the brain capillary endothelium. Certain endogenous peptides, such as insulin or transferrin, undergo receptor-mediated transport (RMT) across the BBB in vivo. In addition, peptidomimetic monoclonal antibodies (MAb) may also cross the BBB via RMT on the endogenous transporters. The MAb may be used as a molecular Trojan horse to ferry across the BBB large molecule pharmaceuticals, including recombinant proteins, antibodies, RNA interference drugs, or non-viral gene medicines. Fusion proteins of the molecular Trojan horse and either neurotrophins or single chain Fv antibodies have been genetically engineered. The fusion proteins retain bi-functional properties, and both bind the BBB receptor, to trigger transport into brain, and bind the cognate receptor inside brain to induce the pharmacologic effect. Trojan horse liposome technology enables the brain targeting of non-viral plasmid DNA. Molecular Trojan horses may be formulated with fusion protein technology, avidin-biotin technology, or Trojan horse liposomes to target to brain virtually any large molecule pharmaceutical.
3149547951	The ultra-structure of the vascular bundle phloem in rice rachilla and its time-course during grain filling period were observed for different positional rachillae within a rice panicle by using low-temperature embedding and electron microscopy technique, and CaM distribution in sieve element (SE) and companion cells (CC) of the central vascular phloem was investigated by immuno-gold localization. The results showed that there were obvious difference in the anatomical structure of the vascular bundle between different positional rice rachillae, with the relative large total vascular area, phloem area and vessel area in central vascular bundle for superior positional rachilla within a panicle, indicting that the superior rachilla had better structure for the assimilate transport compared to the inferior positional rachilla; the similar time-course in the degradation pattern of some organelles of SE and CC in central vascular phloem was observed in different positional rachillae at grain filling stage, with the relative delaying degradation and disintegration of SE, CC and phloem parenchyma cells for inferior positional rachilla; the abundant mitochondrion, chloroplast, starch granules and plasmodesmata, and numerous CaM labeling density were found in SE and CC of superior rachilla compared to inferior positional rachilla at beginning filling stage, while no significant differences between two types of rachilla at middle and late filling stages, implying that superior postional rachilla had relatively better transporting function at initial filling stage relative to inferior rachilla.
3149547956	Xylotrechus rusticus (Linnaeus) is one of the most destructive woodborers in northeast China; it damages poplar and is listed as a domestic forestry quarantine pest. Overwintering larvae were collected during October 2012 and March 2013 in Harbin, China, to quantify indicators related to the insect’s overwintering strategy and the major cryoprotectants. The supercooling points (SCPs), which ranged from –14.7°C to –2.9°C, were higher than the lethal temperatures of LT50 (–33.64°C) and LT99 (–40.17°C) after 24 h exposure. , also the minimum mean daily temperature (–24.5°C) and mean monthly temperature (–18.0°C) at the sampling site in January during 2008–2012. Thus, X. rusticus is a typical freezing-tolerant insect. Glycerol serves as a major cryoprotectant for overwintering larvae , because it was the only polyol accumulated during the winter and it also had a significant negative correlation with the SCP (p= 0.033, R =0.907). The glycogen and lipid are major sources of energy and their levels decreased substantially in the middle of overwintering, when glycogen had a significant correlation with the SCP (p= 0.006, R =0.971) whereas the lipid contents did not. Moreover, inter-conversions between glycerol and glycogen, as well as mannose and glycogen, were suggested by their negative correlations. The water content did not change obviously during the winter and was not correlated with the SCP. The free amino acids in the hemolymph and the total protein contents of
3149548152	The bitter taste sensation is important to warn mammals of the ingestion of potentially toxic food compounds. For mammals, whose nutrition relies on highly specific food sources, such as blood in the case of vampire bats, it is unknown if bitter sensing is involved in prey selection. By contrast to other bat species, vampire bats exhibit numerous bitter taste receptor pseudogenes, which could point to a decreased importance of bitter taste. However, electrophysiological and behavioural studies suggest the existence of functional bitter taste transmission. To determine the agonist spectra of the three bitter taste receptors that are conserved in all three vampire bat species, we investigated the in vitro activation of Desmodus rotundus T2R1, T2R4 and T2R7. Using a set of 57 natural and synthetic bitter compounds, we were able to identify agonists for all three receptors. Hence, we confirmed a persisting functionality and, consequently, a putative biological role of bitter taste receptors in vampire bats. Furthermore, the activation of the human TAS2R7 by metal ions is shown to be conserved in D. rotundus.

3149549126	There is a dialogue between the developing conceptus (embryo-fetus and associated placental membranes) and maternal uterus which must be established during the peri-implantation period for pregnancy recognition signaling, implantation, regulation of gene expression by uterine epithelial and stromal cells, placentation and exchange of nutrients and gases. The uterus provide a microenvironment in which molecules secreted by uterine epithelia or transported into the uterine lumen represent histotroph required for growth and development of the conceptus and receptivity of the uterus to implantation. Pregnancy recognition signaling mechanisms sustain the functional lifespan of the corpora lutea (CL) which produce progesterone, the hormone of pregnancy essential for uterine functions that support implantation and placentation required for a successful outcome of pregnancy. It is within the peri-implantation period that most embryonic deaths occur due to deficiencies attributed to uterine functions or failure of the conceptus to develop appropriately, signal pregnancy recognition and/or undergo implantation and placentation. With proper placentation, the fetal fluids and fetal membranes each have unique functions to ensure hematotrophic and histotrophic nutrition in support of growth and development of the fetus. The endocrine status of the pregnant female and her nutritional status are critical for successful establishment and maintenance of pregnancy. This review addresses the complexity of key mechanisms that are characteristic of successful reproduction in sheep and pigs and gaps in knowledge that must be the subject of research in order to enhance fertility and reproductive health of livestock species.

Employment of sequencing technologies coupled with the use of trained neural network algorithms for genotype-to-phenotype prediction will reduce the time needed for antibiotic susceptibility profile identification from days to hours. In this work, we have sequenced and phenotypically characterized 171 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae from Norway and India. Based on the data, we have created neural networks to predict susceptibility for ampicillin, 3rd generation cephalosporins and carbapenems. All networks were trained on unassembled data, enabling prediction within minutes after the sequencing information becomes available. Moreover, they can be used both on Illumina and MinION generated data and do not require high genome coverage for phenotype prediction. We cross-checked our networks with previously published algorithms for genotype-to-phenotype prediction and their corresponding datasets. Besides, we also created an ensemble of networks trained on different datasets, which improved the cross-dataset prediction compared to a single network. Additionally, we have used data from direct sequencing of spiked blood cultures and found that AMR-Diag networks, coupled with MinION sequencing, can predict bacterial species, resistome, and phenotype as fast as 1–8 h from the sequencing start. To our knowledge, this is the first study for genotype-to-phenotype prediction: (1) employing a neural network method; (2) using data from more than one sequencing platform; and (3) utilizing sequence data from spiked blood cultures.
3149549893	The aim of this study is to investigate the antibacterial effect of endophytic fungi originated from the root of mangrove Rhizophora stylosa growing on Mangrove Plantation Area around DAS Simpang 5 Jl. Piere Tendean Manado. The method of this research was using combination of PDA and NA media. Two species of endophytic fungi were extracted from the root of R. stylosa, black mycelium fungi as isolate A and brown mycelium fungi as isolate B. The activities of both isolates were tested against pathogenic bacteria Staphylococcus aureus and Escherichia coli. The result showed the same inhibition zone of isolate A and B to S. aureus, while, isolate A showed bigger the inhibition zone in comparison to isolate B against E. coli. As a conclusion, the endophytic fungi taken from the root of R. stylosa have antibacterial activity toward S. aureus and E. coli.
3149549908	The present invention provides compositions and methods for making and using a transcriptome-wide gene-expression profiling platform that measure expression levels only for a selected subset in total transcript number. Since gene expression appears to be highly relevant, the remaining expression levels can be inferred by directly measuring approximately a selected few (eg 1000) transcripts. Thus, the present invention includes the possibility of reducing the cost and speeding up the processing of whole-transfectome gene-expression profiling compared to the well-known existing methods of measuring all transcripts.
3149550419	Consumers’ valuation of food products derived from Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) have played a pivotal and often constraining role in the development of biotechnology advances in agriculture. As a result, agricultural companies have started exploring new biotechnologies that do not require the genetic modification of crops. One of these emerging biotechnologies is a non-GMO RNA interference (RNAi) liquid application that could be used to control specific insect pests. When ingested by a targeted sub-species of an insect during production, RNAi blocks the expression of a vital gene, which in turn kills it. RNAi is non-toxic to humans and kills only targeted sub-species of insects, which differs from most conventional pesticides. For example, RNAi could selectively eliminate a specific sub-species of caterpillar pest, while not harming a monarch butterfly caterpillar. In contrast, conventional pesticides often kill insects indiscriminately and vary in human toxicity levels. Since agricultural producers and researchers have faced opposition to GMOs, this may be an alternative to controlling commonly encountered insects; however, consumers’ valuation of traditional GM compared to RNAi derived foods has not been evaluated in the scientific literature. Thus, we conducted a Willingness-To-Pay (WTP) survey in the USA, Canada, Australia, France, and Belgium to analyze whether consumers need a premium or discount for: (1) a hypothetical GMO rice using the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) gene for insect control; and (2) a hypothetical non-GMO rice using RNAi for insect control. Since there is currently no commercially-available GMO rice, measuring consumers’ valuation of rice produced by alternative biotechnologies provides vital information for crop breeders and policy makers. The results suggest that consumers require a discount for RNAi and Bt rice compared to a conventionally produced rice, but the discount required for the non-GMO RNAi rice was 30-40 percent less than that needed to purchase GMO Bt rice (p < 0.01).
3149550432	Objective To understand the infection status of Clonorchis sinensis in freshwater fishes from Dongguan region of Guangdong province. Methods With the digestion method, the encysted metacercariae of Clonorchis sinensis were dete4cted in the muscles of freshwater fishes collected from fish farms and ponds of Dongguan region. Results The infection rates of Clonorchis sinensis in freshwater fishes Ctenopharyngodon idellus and Tilapia mossambica were 82.72% (91/110) and 0 (0/217), respectively. Conclusion There is infection of the encysted metacercariae of Clonorchis sinensis in Ctenopharyngodon idellus in Dongguan region and its infection rate is higher.
3149550644	This research investigates the influence of environmental parameters that are known to affect bdelloid rotifer species richness and composition in temperate zones on the genus Rotaria in tropical zone. Our study analysed species richness and composition of the genus Rotaria from 390 samples collected from several types of aquatic habitats in Thailand. Coordinates, elevation, limnological parameters such as water temperature, conductivity, total dissolved solids, salinity, dissolved oxygen and pH were measured. A total of nine species was recorded. Of these, one species, Rotaria macrura (Ehrenberg, 1832), was a new record for Thailand and new to the oriental region, and was a yet undescribed species, Rotaria sp. The species diversity of this genus increased from eight to 10 species. The presence or absence of the genus Rotaria was significantly influenced by dissolved oxygen and habitat type. For the samples where the genus occurred, species richness was not affected by any of the limnological or bioclimatic variables. Differences in species composition were affected only by habitat type. The results support former suggestions that common abiotic parameters do not seem to strongly influence diversity in bdelloids, whereas major ecological differences between habitats influence bdelloid occurrence.
3149551021	Head smut, caused by the fungal pathogen Sporisorium reilianum, poses a grave threat to maize(Zea mays) production worldwide. Here we report cytological and molecular evidence for maize resistance to head smut. During early stages of root infection, S. reilianum mycelium was capable of penetrating the root epidermis of both resistant(Ji1037) and susceptible(HZ4) inbred lines. S. reilianum hyphae were observed in the root–stem junction at 6 days after inoculation. In an attempt to monitor hyphal spread within the maize plant,a highly specific and sensitive real-time PCR method was established to estimate the hyphal content in infected maize tissues. During the upward growth of endophytic S.reilianum, the extent of hyphal spread was markedly different between Ji1037 and HZ4. Very little or no pathogen was detected in aerial parts of Ji1037, whereas large amounts of pathogen accumulated in aboveground tissues, particularly inflorescences, of HZ4. Thus,maize resistance to S. reilianum was achieved mainly by inhibition of endophytic hyphal growth rather than by prevention of early-root penetration by the pathogen.

3149551292	[Aim]Bemisia tabaci is a species complex with rapid evolutionary modifications. In recent years,its biotypes gained more attention because of its increasing hazards to the agricultural crops. Previously there were few sympatric non-B biotypes in different regions of China except B biotype. The study described herein provides some theoretical basis for its biotype detection and integrated control by identifying its biotypes which currently prevail in China and their relationship with different biotypes from other countries.[Methods]The biotypes and phylogenetic relationships of 22 different non-B biotype populations collected from six provinces were studied based on 16S rDNA sequences. [Results] The results revealed that the 22 different populations of non-B B. tabaci belong to Q,Nauru and An biotypes. Evolutionary divergence among these biotypes was more than 10%. The relationship between Q and B biotypes was closest,with genetic distances between 2.8% and 4.0%. The genetic distances among different biotypes were significantly higher than within the same biotype,while Q biotype showed the least genetic distance of 0.9% within itself. It is a universal phenomenon that multiple biotypes prevail in the same region. The Nauru biotype was more widely distributed than the other two biotypes. The highest variety of non-B biotypes was detected in Yunnan province. [Conclusion] The genetic differentiation of B. tabaci is very complicated. The biotypes of B. tabaci can be effectively identified using 16S rDNA gene.

2398613095	The fragments of cotton Gossipium hirsutum c.v. 108-f chloroplast genome were cloned in Escherichia coli cells. The cloned psbA and rbcL genes have been selected using the heterologous probes from spinach. The preliminary attempts to clone the complete psbA gene in pUC19 vector failed, probably, due to the toxicity of its product to Escherichia coli cells, and its 5'- and 3'-ends were cloned separately. Reconstruction experiments revealed that while the complete psbA gene was unable to be stably inherited by Escherichia coli cells, its structural part lacking the promoter region could be readily cloned in the bacterial cells.
2398613160	Induction of maturation in Chaetopterus oocytes requires the presence of Ca++ ions in the medium, but differentiation without cleavage can proceed in the absence of this cation. The Ca++ ionophore A 23187 induces both maturation and the cortical reaction provided that Ca++ ions are present in the medium differentiation without cleavage may follow. Valinomycin slowly induces germinal vesicle breakdown, which is followed by a sharp segregation between hyaloplasm and yolk. PHMPS, but not DTT, induces maturation. Differentiation without cleavage is more sensitive to colchicin than to cytochalasin B.
2398613379	Mycoplasma (M.) californicum und M. bovigenitalium mastitis had occurred in four herds. 240 milk samples of 120 cows were tested for M. californicum, using in parallel nine different culturing substrates and test methods. Included were 120 initial and 120 final milk samples. Inoculation of milk to medium-I broth containing V-factor yeast extract, incubation at 37 degrees C for 5 days, subsequent spreading onto cattle blood agar with staphylococcal nutrix, followed by 5 days of incubation proved to be superior to all other culturing substrates and methods tested and resulted in positive detection of M. californicum in 69 milk samples. M. californicum was identified in 70 milk samples by combination of all 9 test variants. No significant difference was found to exist with regard to isolation results between initial and final milking samples.
2398613395	Seventy four species of Cerambycidae (Coleoptera) were reared from forty eight host plants found into Yungas, Chaco and Prepuna phytogeografical provinces. The host plants belong Anacardiaceae, Asclepiadaceae, Bignoniaceae, Cactaceae, Cucurbitaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Juglandaceae, Leguminosae sensu lato (Caesalpinaceae, Fabaceae, Mimosaceae), Loranthaceae, Rhamnaceae, Rutaceae, Salicaceae, Sapindaceae, Solanaceae, Ulmaceae and Vitaceae. Some species of Cerambycidae and their host plants show similar distribution patterns: from northeastern Brazil through Paraguay and reach the Argentina at both sides of the Chaco Provine: at the east, along the river systems through Buenos Aires, and the at the west into forests of the Yungas Province or into North Sierra Chaco, a probably relictual community. Others species are restricted to the South America area of Prosopis, that comprise the Chaco, Monte and Espinal biogeographical provinces, and live in host plants of chaquenian lineage mainly Leguminosae sensu lato and Ulmaceae.
2398613715	The invention relates to a plant based formulation for the prevention and management of obesity and associated complications comprising of an effective amount of hydro-alcoholic extract of Salacia reticulata, Garcinia indica, Dioscorea bulbifera, Terminalia chebula and optionally additives in trace amounts.
2398613849	Using solid-phase immune electron microscopy, 126 of 129 human rotavirus (HRV) strains could be serotyped directly in stools collected in Italy during the period 1981–1985. Prevalence was 70.5 per cent for serotype 1, and 13.2 per cent for each of serotypes 2 and 4. No serotype 3 strain was detected. In parallel, for 39 of 61 HRV strains tested the electropherotype of genomic RNA was successfully determined. Different electropherotypes were detected among strains of the same serotype, whereas the same electropherotype was found in HRV strains of different serotypes. Serotyping and electropherotyping of HRV strains appear to be complementary to each other, and both should be used in conjunction for epidemiological surveys.
2398613897	The amygdaloid complex was studied in the cat in Golgi-Kopsch stained section series. Golgi type I (or long axon) neurons are present in all the amygdaloid nuclei. They vary in the different nuclei in shape, arrangement and in size but all have axons that leave the amygdala to establish connections with other regions. They usually have one or more initial locally arborizing collaterals. Two types of interneurons with short axons (Golgi type II) can be distinguished especially in the basal, lateral, cortical nuclei and in the amygdaloid area. One type has an axon arborizing by repeated dichotomical ramifications or in a fountain-like manner, but it does not extend beyond the span of the dendritic tree. The other type has more the character of the neurogliform cells with extremely delicate, beaded processes, the axon and dendrites cannot be easily distinguished. A third type of interneurons was observed in the lateral and basal nuclei. This type of interneurons has a longer axon, which divides into two branches, one arborizes in the neighborhood of the cell body, the other passes on for a further distance to terminate in other nuclei of the complex. The classification of this cell type, hence, is a matter of argument. The intraamygdaloid course of fibers associated with the stria terminalis was studied. The terminal arborizations of the afferent component were observed in the cortical and basolateral nuclei, the afferent component of the stria originates from cells in the central, cortical and medial nuclei. A reciprocal connection between the preamygdaloid part of the piriform cortical areas and the ventrolateral part of the amygdala could be ascertained. Terminal arborizations of some of these cortical afferents were observed in the basolateral nuclei.
2398613969	For the purpose of producing L-ornithine by microbial fermentation, mutant strains were developed from glutamate-producing bacteria by mutagenesis using N-methyl-N'-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (NTG) and UV irradiation. Brevibacterium ketoglutamicum BK1046, a L-citrulline auxotroph which is also resistant to arginine hydroxamate (Arghx), was isolated and selected as the best producer of L-ornithine. This strain was capable of producing L-ornithine at a concentration of 24 g/l after 69 hours of cultivation in the 21 jar fermentor. The optimum supplementary level of L-arginine, a substitute for L-citrulline, was found to be about 0.2 g/l in the shake-flask fermentation.
2398614155	The invention relates to the use of one of the enzymes pancreatin, bromelain, papain, lipase, amylase, trypsin and/or chymotrypsin to activate macrophages and/or NK cells, enzymatically activated macrophages and/or NK cells, and to a medicinal composition for the activation of macrophages and/or NK cells.
2398614281	When released from cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells, Granzyme (Gzm) serine proteases induce programmed cell death of pathogen-infected cells and tumor cells. The Gzms rapidly accumulate in the target cell nucleus by an unknown mechanism. Many of the known substrates of GzmA and GzmB, the most abundant killer cell proteases, bind to DNA or RNA. Gzm substrates predicted by unbiased proteomics studies are also highly enriched for nucleic acid binding proteins. Here we show by fluorescence polarization assays that Gzms bind DNA and RNA with nanomolar affinity. We hypothesized that Gzm binding to nucleic acids enhances nuclear accumulation in target cells and facilitates their cleavage of nucleic acid-binding substrates. In fact, RNase treatment of cell lysates reduced cleavage of RNA binding protein (RBP) targets by GzmA and GzmB. Moreover, adding RNA to recombinant RBP substrates greatly enhanced in vitro cleavage by GzmB, but adding RNA to non-nucleic acid binding proteins did not. For example, exogenous RNA enhanced GzmB cleavage of recombinant hnRNP C1 (an RBP) but not LMNB1 (a non-RBP). In addition, GzmB cleaved the RNA-binding HuR protein efficiently only when it was bound to an HuR-binding RNA oligonucleotide, but not in the presence of an equal amount of non-binding RNA. Thus, nucleic acids facilitate Gzm cleavage of nucleic acid binding substrates. To evaluate whether nucleic acid binding influences Gzm trafficking in target cells, we incubated fixed target cells with RNase and then added Gzms. RNA degradation in target cells reduced Gzm cytosolic localization and increased nuclear accumulation. Similarly, pre-incubating Gzms with exogenous competitor DNA reduced Gzm nuclear localization. The Gzms form a monophyletic clade with other immune serine proteases including neutrophil elastase (NE) and cathepsin G (CATG). Upon neutrophil activation, NE translocates to the nucleus to drive the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs). NE and CATG, but not non-immune serine proteases such as trypsin and pancreatic elastase, also bind DNA with high affinity and localize to the nucleus of permeabilized cells. Consistent with this finding, competitor DNA also blocks the nuclear localization of NE. Moreover NE and CATG localization to NETs depends on DNA binding. Thus the antimicrobial activity of NETs may depend in part upon the affinity of these proteases for DNA. Our findings indicate that high affinity nucleic acid binding is a conserved and functionally important property of serine proteases involved in cell-mediated immunity.

3149552278	Unstable microhabitats (merocenoses)—such as decayed wood, ant hills, bird and mammal nests—constitute an important component of forest (and non-forest) envi- ronments. These microhabitats are often inhabited by specific communities of invertebrates and their presence increases the total biodiversity. The primary objective of the present study was to compare communities of Uropodina (Acari: Mesostigmata) inhabiting soil and unstable microhabitats in order to explore the specificity of these communities and their importance in such ecosystems. Uropodine communities inhabiting merocenoses are often predominated by one or two species, which constitute more than 50 % of the entire community. Many species occur commonly in particular merocenoses, but are absent or rare in soil and litter, for example, Allodinychus flagelliger, Metagynella carpatica, Oplitis alophora, and Phaulodiaspis borealis. The biology of Uropodina inhabiting unstable microhabitats is modified by the adaptations required for living in such habitats. Mites associated with merocenoses developed special dispersal mechanisms, such as phoresy, which enable them to migrate from disappearing environments. Communities of Uropo- dina in soil and litter predominately consisted of species which reproduce parthenoge- netically (thelytoky), whereas in merocenoses bisexual species prevail.
3149552323	The invention discloses grass carp feed, which is prepared from the following raw materials in parts by weight: 30 to 50 parts of dregs of beans, 20 to 30 parts of corn flour, 10 to 20 parts of beer vinasse, 5 to 10 parts of cicada pupa power, 5 to 10 parts of seaweed powder, 4 to 7 parts of pumpkin powder, 1 to 3 parts of lettuce, 1 to 3 parts of spicate clerodendranthus herb, 1 to 3 parts of Chinese cabbage leaves, 1 to 2 parts of calcium bicarbonate and 2 to 3 parts of phagostimulants. The grass carp feed has the advantages that the nutrition is balanced and overall; the health growth of the grass carp is ensured; the mouthfeel of the feed can be improved through adding the phagostimulants, the feed intake of the grass feed is improved; the growth speed of the grass carp is accelerated.
3149552344	In response to limited availability of soil resources in basal root zone, plant extends its roots into nearby resource-rich zones to fulfill essential resource demands for survival and reproduction. This root proliferation into that enriched zones occupied by other plants constitutes interplant overlapping rooting zones and thereby the overlapping depletion zones, causing reduction in resource uptake by neighboring plants. By incorporating this mechanism into the classic resource competition model, we study interplant direct competition through their rooting system in an overlapping depletion zone. The model results indicate an extension of Tilman’s R* rule that has already been proved true when plants compete indirectly through their effect on shared resources. The results reveal that plant’s direct competitive ability (i.e., the ability to occupy an overlapping depletion zone by excluding others) can be characterized by its R*-value, where a best competitor having lowest R*-value excludes others from an overlapping zone and occupies the zone by depleting the resource level to the lowest as in its non-overlapping depletion zone. By analyzing the model, we find a suite of traits that confers R* variation among directly competing plants. This suite of traits would be a useful proxy measure for R* that do not necessarily require to establish equilibrium field monoculture-a requirement for R* measurement in the field.

2398614388	Irradiation of rats with doses of 0.5 to 2 Gy was shown to cause dose-dependent changes in the sensitivity of brain cell chromatin to the effect of DNAase I that were manifested by the increased level of DNA hydrolysis and a high content of the chromatin soluble fractions. The chromatin structure was only partially restored 24 h after irradiation. Changes in the chromatin structure were accompanied by the increase in the histone-specific proteinase activity.
2398615064	Reconstructing evolutionary adaptive paths (REAP) is a low-throughput technique used to design protein libraries that can be assayed for specific properties such as catalytic function or thermostability. This approach takes advantage of natural selection by using theoretical ancestral proteins as the foundation for library variants. REAP gives rise to smaller libraries but with a higher ratio of viable proteins than other high-throughput techniques. REAP uses analyses of ancestral sequences and signatures of functional divergence to modify extant protein sequences. This allows the experimenter to statistically evaluate which amino acid mutations in which sites within the protein are most likely to produce functional proteins having varied phenotypes.
3149552384	Mineral weathering by microorganisms is considered to occur through a succession of mechanisms based on acidification and chelation. While the role of acidification is established, the role of siderophores is difficult to disentangle from the effect of the acidification. We took advantage of the ability of strain Collimonas pratensis PMB3(1) to weather minerals but not to acidify depending on the carbon source to address the role of siderophores in mineral weathering. We identified a single non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) responsible for siderophore biosynthesis in the PMB3(1) genome. By combining iron-chelating assays, targeted mutagenesis and chemical analyses (HPLC and LC-ESI-HRMS), we identified the siderophore produced as malleobactin X and how its production depends on the concentration of available iron. Comparison with the genome sequences of other collimonads evidenced that malleobactin production seems to be a relatively conserved functional trait, though some collimonads harboured other siderophore synthesis systems. We also revealed by comparing the wild-type strain and its mutant impaired in the production of malleobactin that the ability to produce this siderophore is essential to allow the dissolution of hematite under non-acidifying conditions. This study represents the first characterization of the siderophore produced by collimonads and its role in mineral weathering.

The comprehensive performance of Gannan02-70 and Yuegan 35 was between the two controls. DTOPSIS analysis results showed that Ci sequence was Liucheng 03-1137, Yunzhe 05-51, Yunzhe 06-407, Funong 39, ROC22(CK1), Yuegan 35, Gannan 02-70, ROC16(CK2), Yunzhe04-241, Funong 02-5707, Funong 36, Yuegan 34. 【Conclusion】Liucheng 03-1137, Yunzhe 05-51, Funong 39 and Yunzhe 06-407 were suitable for Ruili and similar sugarcane areas of Yunnan where exhibited humid climate ecological conditions. Gannan 02-70 matured early with moderate yield, hence it also could be applied in this kind of sugarcane area, but lodging should be prevented during the cultivation.
3139604343	Chromosome segment substitution lines (CSSL) consist of a battery of nearisogenic lines that have been developed and cover the entire genome of some crops. With the exception of one homozygous chromosome segment transferred from a donor parent, the remaining genome of each CSSL line is the same as the recipient parent. It is an ideal material for genome research and particularly QTL mapping. In the present study, we first developed one set of CSSL lines using G. hirsutum acc. TM-1 (the genetic standard), as the recipient parent and G. barbadense cv. Hai7124 as the donor parent using molecular assisted-selection in BC5S1-3 generations. The CSSL consisted of 330 different lines, in which 1―4 different lines had the same or overlapping substituted segments. The genetic length of the substituted segments covered 5271.9 cM with an average segment distance of 10.9 cM, 1.5 times the total genetic length of Upland cotton (3514.6 cM). The substituted segments of each line varied in length, ranging from 3.5 cM for the shortest segment to 23.2 cM in the longest segment. Our CSSL have not yet to cover the entire tetraploid cotton genome, due to the absence of some donor parent interval segments.

3139604473	Background: The APOA1-C3-A5 gene cluster plays an important role in the regulation of lipids. Asian Indians have an increased tendency for abnormal lipid levels and high risk of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the relationship of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Apo11q cluster, namely the -75G>A, +83C>T SNPs in the APOA1 gene, the Sac1 SNP in the APOC3 gene and the S19W variant in the APOA5 gene to plasma lipids and CAD in 190 affected sibling pairs (ASPs) belonging to Asian Indian families with a strong CAD history. Methods & results: Genotyping and lipid assays were carried out using standard protocols. Plasma lipids showed a strong heritability (h2 48% – 70%; P A (LOD score 2.77) SNPs by single-point analysis (P A (pi 0.56) and +83C>T (pi 0.52) (P A SNPs along with hypertension showed maximized correlations with TC, TG and Apo B by association analysis.

3139604476	Larra bicolor F. (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) is a specialist parasitoid of Scapteriscus (Orthoptera: Gryllotalpidae) mole crickets, attacking adults and medium to large nymphs. Reproductive systems were dissected from 10 female wasps collected in northern Florida. Each had 2 ovaries, each with 3 ovarioles. The maximal number of mature eggs (10) plus developing oocytes (83) was 93. Female wasps deposit an egg on the venter of the host’s thorax, and the wasp larva develops as an ectoparasitoid. Twenty newly-emerged female wasps housed in small cages with at least 1 male and with 7 potential hosts replaced daily deposited a mean 2.44 eggs (range 0-10) per day for a total lifetime production averaging 56 eggs (range 17-91) during a lifespan averaging 23.5 d (range 8-40). Assuming 3 wasp generations with fecundity as shown to 1 host generation, per year, the wasp should easily be able to outreproduce its host mole crickets. A few of the hosts became superparasitized with 2 or even 3 eggs, but at most 1 larva of L. bicolor developed successfully on each host, so superparasitism is a disadvantage; its incidence in the laboratory (<2%) and field (3%) was low.
3139604661	The European green crab (Carcinus maenas) is invasive on the West coast of North America, but the ecological consequences of this invasion remain poorly understood. Comparative functional response analysis has arisen as a method of elucidating ecological consequences of invasive species by comparing the impact of these species to native analogues. Through comparative functional response experiments of green crabs and native red rock crabs (Cancer productus) we found that green crab predation increased asymptotically (Type II functional response) when fed increasing densities of Pacific oysters (Magallana gigas), while red rock crab predation displayed a sigmoidal (Type III) response. At high oyster densities red rock crabs consume more Pacific oysters than green crabs do, due to their reduced handling time, though green crabs consume more Pacific oysters relative to their size than red rock crabs. However, compared to red rock crabs, green crabs consume more oysters at low prey densities, which implies that they have a larger, potentially destabilizing impact on low densities of Pacific oysters. As green crabs continue to spread across the West coast of North America, Pacific oysters will face increased predation pressure. Our results show the advantage of using functional response analysis to compare density dependent predation between an invasive species and a native species to predict the ecological consequences of invasions.
2398615238	Retroviral gene transfer vectors have been developed for optimal in vivo gene therapy. Ideally, these vectors should target gene expression specifically to selected tissues or organs. Our studies focus on the development of retroviral vectors for gene delivery to the thymus. The goal of these studies is to utilize thymic expression of exogenous genes to manipulate the immune repertoire. We have characterized the selective thymic tropism of a molecular clone of Gross murine leukemia virus, GD-17, to thymic medullary epithelial cells using immunohistochemical staining and confocal microscopy. Specific expression of viral antigens in the thymus lead to the induction of immunologic tolerance to GMuLV proteins. This tissue specific vector may thus be used to study the requirements of epithelial mediated tolerance induction, and provide a more efficient tool for gene therapy.
2398615342	A case of infectious gastroenteritis (GEI) caused by a non-A Rotavirus (RV) in the province of Tucuman is reported. Fecal sample analysis for group A RV by enzyme immunoassay (ELISA) gave a negative result. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) of the viral RNA showed a genomic pattern coincident with that described by Pedley for RV belonging to group C. To our knowledge, this is the first communication on the detection of non-A RV as an etiological agent of human GEI in Argentina.
2398615365	Transplantation of embryonic dopamine (DA) neurons has been tested as a therapy for Parkinson's disease. Most studies placed DA neurons into the striatum instead of the substantia nigra (SN). Reconstruction of this DA pathway could serve to establish a more favorable environment for control of DA release by grafted neurons. To test this we used cografts of striatum to stimulate growth of DA axons from embryonic SN that was implanted adjacent to the host SN in African green monkeys. Embryonic striatum was implanted at one of three progressive distances rostral to the SN. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed DA neuron survival and neuritic outgrowth from the SN grafts at 12-36 weeks after grafting. Each animal showed survival of substantial numbers of DA neurons. Most fibers that exited SN grafts coursed rostrally. Striatal grafts showed evidence of target-directed outgrowth and contained dense patterns of DA axons that could be traced from their origin in the SN grafts. A polarity existed for DA neurites that exited the grafts; that is, those seen caudal to the grafts did not appear to be organized into a directional outflow while those on the rostral side were arranged in linear profiles coursing toward the striatal grafts. Some TH fibers that reached the striatal grafts appeared to arise from the residual DA neurons of the SN. These findings suggest that grafted DA neurons can extend neurites toward a desired target over several millimeters through the brain stem and caudal diencephalon of the monkey brain, which favors the prospect of circuit reconstruction from grafted neurons placed into appropriate locations in their neural circuitry. Further study will assess the degree to which this approach can be used to restore motor balance in the nonhuman primate following neural transplantation.

2398615553	v-ErbA is a mutated variant of thyroid hormone receptor (TRalpha/NR1A1) borne by the Avian Erythroblastosis virus causing erythroleukemia. TRalpha is known to activate transcription of specific genes in the presence of its cognate ligand, T3 hormone, while in its absence it represses it. v-ErbA is unable to bind ligand, and hence is thought to contribute to leukemogenesis by actively repressing erythroid-specific genes such as the carbonic anhydrase II gene (CA II). In the prevailing model, v-ErbA occludes liganded TR from binding to its cognate elements and constitutively interacts with the corepressors NCoR/SMRT. We previously identified a v-ErbA responsive element (VRE) within a DNase I hypersensitive region (HS2) located in the second intron of the CA II gene. We now show that HS2 fulfils all the requirements for a genuine enhancer that functions independent of its orientation and position with a profound erythroid-specific activity in normal erythroid progenitors (T2ECs) and in leukemic erythroid cell lines. We find that the HS2 enhancer activity is governed by two adjacent GATA-factor binding sites. v-ErbA as well as unliganded TR prevent HS2 activity by nullifying the positive function of factors bound to GATA-sites. However, v-ErbA, in contrast to TR, does not convey active repression to silence the transcriptional activity intrinsic to a heterologous tk promoter. We propose that depending on the sequence and context of the binding site, v-ErbA contributes to leukemogenesis by occluding liganded TR as well as unliganded TR thereby preventing activation or repression, respectively.
2398615694	The reproductive biology of Garra regressus and Garra tana was investigated by collecting monthly samples (January to December 2006) from the southern Gulf of Lake Tana, where these species are endemic.  Garra regressus has an extended breeding time from April to October while G. tana breeds throughout the year with a peak from March to July.  The mean size at maturity in both the species was not significantly different between the sexes, but G. tana had a significantly lower mean size at maturity than G. regressus in female specimens.  Absolute fecundity estimates for G. regressus ranged from 580.8–1800, while those for G. tana ranged from 538.9–2968.  Egg size frequency distribution revealed that G. regressus is a multiple spawner, while G. tana is a single spawner.  The sex ratio in the total catch of G. regressus was found to be skewed in favour of females (Chi-square, P< 0.05), while those for G. tana was not significantly different from 1:1. The mean size at maturity was not significantly different between the sexes for G. tana .
2398615747	Objective To set up the fittest medium and optimum condition for leaves from Rehmannia glutinosa to form regenerated plantlets directly and to induce microtubers. Method Leaves of different phases obtained from the virus-free plantlets were incubated in some kinds of media on the back side. Result and conclusion The fittest medium for the formation of regenerated plantlet was MS + 6-BA 2.0 mg.L-1 and the fittest medium for the induction of microtuber was MS + 6-BA 1.0 mg.L-1 + NAA 0.5 mg.L-1. The optimum incubation temperaue was 25 degrees C and the light length was (2,000-3,000 lx) 12 h.d-1.
2398615948	Laboratory and field studies were undertaken in an attempt to improve mosquito control with insecticide-treated fabrics. The efficacies of the emulsifiable concentrates (E.C.) of three pyrethroids were assessed on three types of fibre in order to establish the optimum combination for bednet use. Various pyrethroid formulations were compared for persistence and wash-fastness. Incorporation of polystyrene into the E.C. of permethrin increased its wash-resistance. Scanning electron microscope studies revealed a film of permethrin on impregnated nylon fibre which was not visible on similarly impregnated cotton fibre. Using an acoustic actograph to record flight activity and video to record behaviour, impregnated nylon was found to cause greater irritancy than impregnated cotton. The contact times for mosquitoes to pick-up lethal doses from permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin treated netting were established and related to the time that a hungry mosquito spends searching for a bloodmeal. Studies on sublethal effects of treated netting such as knock-down, leg fracture and feeding inhibition were carried out. Experimental hut trials of bednets were undertaken in The Gambia to compare five different insecticides, an insecticide mixture and two formulations incorporating polystyrene. The unwashed permethrin formulations strongly deterred hut entry by An.gambiae s.l. and Mansonia spp. but this effect was lost after washing the nets three times. The unwashed insecticide-treated nets killed a significantly higher percentage of An.gambiae s.l. that entered the huts than the untreated net. Washing treated nets decreased the percentages killed by them, with the exception of the wash-resistant permethrin which showed no significant change in the percentage of mosquitoes killed. This formulation killed a significantly higher percentage than the normal permethrin formulation after washing. The unwashed mixture of permethrin and pirimiphos-methyl treated net performed well over the 6 weeks of the trial, but chemical analyses at the end of this time showed very little of its pirimiphos-methyl remained on the net. The effects of all the nets on numbers entering and exiting from huts and numbers found killed and bloodfed are reported. A trial was carried out in a village to compare nets treated with the wash- resistant formulation of permethrin, normal E.C.s of permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin and placebo. The numbers of mosquitoes found over 16 weeks during weekly bednet searches of the insecticide treated nets were greatly reduced compared with the placebo treated nets. Analysis of bioassay mortality showed that the permethrin formulation containing polystyrene (wash-resistant) was significantly less affected by washing under village conditions than the normal permethrin and lambdacyhalothrin formulations.
3149552940	Soybean has undergone extensive selection pressures for seed nutrient composition and seed color during domestication, but the major genetic loci controlling seed coat color have not been completely understood, and the transcriptional regulation relationship among the loci remains elusive. Here, two major regulators, GmMYBA2 and GmMYBR, were functionally characterized as an anthocyanin activator and repressor, respectively. Ectopic expression of GmMYBA2 in soybean hairy roots conferred the enhanced accumulation of delphinidin and cyanidin types of anthocyanins in W1t and w1T backgrounds, respectively, through activating anthocyanin biosynthetic genes in the reported loci. The seed coat pigmentation of GmMYBA2-overexpressing transgenic plants in the W1 background mimicked the imperfect black phenotype (W1/w1, i, R, t), suggesting that GmMYBA2 was responsible for the R locus. Molecular and biochemical analysis showed that GmMYBA2 interacted with GmTT8a to directly activate anthocyanin biosynthetic genes. GmMYBA2 and GmMYBR might form a feedback loop to fine-tune seed coat coloration, which was confirmed in transgenic soybeans. Both GmTT8a and GmMYBR that were activated by GmMYBA2 in turn enhanced and obstructed the formation of the GmMYBA2-GmTT8a module, respectively. The results revealed the sophisticated regulatory network underlying the soybean seed coat pigmentation loci and shed light on the understanding of the seed coat coloration and other seed inclusions.
3139604889	Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.), as a source of oil and protein, is the second most important grain legume cultivated in the world. Peanut is a relatively drought tolerant crop; however, the molecular biology research of peanut is far behind other crops; the molecular mechanisms of its stress resistance are poorly understood. DELLA proteins, negative regulators of gibberellin signaling pathway in plants, promote survival of plants in adverse environments. In this study, four DELLA homologue genes were isolated using peanut transcriptome sequences. Molecular phylogenetic analysis revealed that these four AhDELLAs fall into three distinct groups: AhDELLA1 and AhDELLA2 clustered into two distinct groups, while AhDELLA3 and AhDELLA4 were in one group, which was separated from other DELLAs. qRT PCR results showed that these four DELLA genes were expressed differentially in various peanut tissues. The AhDELLA1 and AhDELLA2 genes were expressed ubiquitously in different tissues. AhDELLA3 and AhDELLA4 showed much higher expression level in flowers and seeds as compared with other organs. The expression of four AhDELLA genes was temporally induced by PEG 6000 treatment. The AhDELLA3 and AhDELLA4 tran scripts were significantly induced by NaCl treatment, while the expression of AhDELLA1 and AhDELLA2 did not change much under salt stress. The possible role of DELLA proteins in peanut development and responses to abiotic stresses is discussed.
3149553342	Eutrophication or the process of nutrient enrichment of stagnant waters due to excessive use of fertilizer is becoming a critical issue worldwide. Lake Gregory, an artificial lake situated in Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka was once a very attractive landscape feature and recreational area attracting a large number of visitors. Rapid urbanization in surrounding areas and the consequent intensification of agricultural and industrial activities led to eutrophication and siltation in the lake. Present study was conducted to detect cyanobacterial diversity and their ability to produce hepatotoxic microcystins using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based techniques. Twenty five water samples (surface and bottom) were collected from the lake and total nitrogen and total carbon were estimated. Cyanobacterial cultures were grown in appropriate media and microscopic observations were used to determine the morphological diversity of cyanobacteria isolated from different sites. Genomic DNA was isolated and purified from cyanobacteria using Boom’s method. DNA samples were analyzed by PCR with oligonucleotide primers for 16S rRNA gene and mcyA gene of the operon that encodes a microcystin synthetase. The 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed the presences of cyanobacteria belong to Synechococcus sp., Microcystis aeruginosa, Calothrix sp., Leptolyngbya sp., Limnothrix sp., order Oscillatoriales and order Chroococcales. The sequences obtained from this study were deposited in the database under the accession numbers (GenBank: GU368104–GU368116). PCR amplification of mcyA primers indicated the potential for toxin formation of isolated M. aeruginosa from Lake Gregory. This preliminary study shows that the Lake Gregory is under the potential risk of cyanobacterial toxicity. Clearly more work is needed to extend this finding and clarify if other cyanobacterial isolates have genetic potential to produce microcystin since this lake is utilized for recreational activities.
2398616057	Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) is the key pest of citrus in Florida, responsible for the spread of huanglongbing or citrus greening disease. Feeding damage from CLM larvae facilitates the spread of citrus canker. Insecticides are critical for suppression of these two pests. The experimental block at the Southwest Florida Research and Education Center consisted of 5-yr-old sweet orange “Hamlin” trees bud grafted to “US-802” (Citrus grandis × Poncirus trifoliata) planted at a density of 308 trees/acre. Trees were irrigated with microsprinklers and subjected to conventional cultural practices. Eight treatments and an untreated check, seven trees per plot, were randomly distributed …
2398616130	Determining the etiologic causes of febrile illness in tropical settings provides public health and local community benefits. In the context of a decline in malaria cases in many parts of sub-Saharan Africa, the few studies that have been conducted in recent years to analyze the burden of bacterial infections used traditional blood cultures and identified typhoid fever and Streptococcus pneumoniae as the leading documented causes of nonmalarial bloodstream infections (1–3). However, this method does not enable the identification of intracellular organisms, and most causes of fever remain unknown. In 2008, we initiated a study of the etiologies of fevers of unknown origin in Africa, particularly in Senegal. Our preliminary studies showed the presence of previously known pathogenic microorganisms, such as Borrelia crocidurae, Rickettsia felis, R. conorii, and Coxiella burnetii, and the unexpected presence of Tropheryma whipplei (4–9).  T. whipplei was first considered to be an uncommon bacterium that causes Whipple disease, a rare chronic disease (10). However, T. whipplei is in fact a common bacterium associated with various conditions, such as acute infections (pneumonia and gastroenteritis) and chronic infections (classic Whipple disease and other infections without digestive involvement, including endocarditis and encephalitis) (10–19). T. whipplei can also be carried in human feces and, less commonly, in the saliva (20–23); carriage prevalence varies by the age and exposure of the population and by geographic area (21–30).  T. whipplei is highly prevalent in rural Senegal, where carriage rates reach 75% among children 1,000 blood samples from healthy persons and ambulatory patients with acute fever.
2398616261	The biosynthesis of chitin has been obtained in broken mycelia and protoplasts of the fungus Aspergillus fumigatus. The specific activity of chitin synthase (EC 2.4.1.16) in a membrane preparation from protoplasts derived from the hyphal tips of A. fumigatus was 26.8-fold greater than that of the chitin synthase in broken mycelia, indicating that the active chitin synthase is located primarily in a membrane-bound site at the hyphal tip. Polyoxin D was a potent competitive inhibitor of the enzyme, having Ki 5.2 +/- 0.8 micron with respect to the natural substrate UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine, which has Km 1.58 mM.
2398616292	This study aimed to develop a new set of screening criteria that is easily applicable and highly sensitive for the detection of patients at high risk of Fabry disease (FD) among hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) patients. We prospectively studied 273 consecutive unrelated patients who were referred to HCM clinic for unknown left ventricular hypertrophy. Among the 273 patients, we selected 65 high-risk patients who fulfilled at least one of our newly proposed screening criteria. All 273 patients were assayed for plasma α-galactosidase A (α-GAL A) activity. The new screening criteria were: (1) atypical HCM, (2) history or presence of documented arrhythmia, (3) short PR interval defined as <120 ms on electrocardiogram, and (4) symptoms of autonomic dysfunction. From this screening study, three unrelated patients (4.6%; 2 females and 1 male) were newly diagnosed with FD using α-GAL A activity and mutation analysis of the GLA gene. Using the screening method based on the newly proposed criteria, the prevalence of FD in our HCM population was 4.6% if at least one criterion was met and 18.8% if ⩾3 criteria were met. Therefore, our proposed criteria are easily applicable and highly sensitive for classifying patients at high risk of FD from HCM patients.

2398616419	The CC-chemokine receptor 5 (CCR5) mediates activation of T lymphocytes and macrophages by chemokines and is a major co-receptor for macrophage-tropic HIV-1 strains. Recently, it was shown that the natural CCR5 ligands RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha (MIP-1alpha), MIP-1beta, and amino-terminal modifications of RANTES (Met-RANTES, AOP-RANTES) significantly differ in their abilities to induce sequestration of CCR5 from cellular surfaces. It was hypothesized that these findings may account for the observed differences between these molecules to inhibit HIV infectivity in vitro. Herein we review our work on early regulatory mechanisms that are initiated by ligand binding to CCR5 and that, conceptually, are involved in receptor endocytosis. A better understanding of these mechanisms may provide new therapeutic strategies to prevent HIV infection.
2398616444	We have studied the nuclear distribution of the non-histone HMG-I protein by indirect immunofluorescence in several human and murine somatic cell lines and in growing mouse oocytes. We show that HMG-I, a high mobility-group protein which interacts in vitro with the minor groove of AT-rich B-DNA, is found exclusively in the nucleus and that this localization corresponds to a complex distribution. By comparing the HMG-I-dependent fluorescence signal with the chromatin density determined by Hoechst 33342 or propidium iodide staining, we present evidence for the existence of three HMG-I sub-populations whose contribution to the total fluorescence can be determined using a newly developed quantitative co-localization image analysis program: foci that correspond to regions of heterochromatin, intense dots located within decondensed chromatin, and a more diffuse component extending throughout the nucleoplasm. In addition, we show that these sub-populations differ in their sensitivity to nuclease digestion and in vivo displacement by the minor-groove binder Hoechst 33342. Finally, double immunolabeling of RNA polymerase II-dependent transcription and HMG-I shows that the intense dots are not correlated with sites of high transcriptional activity. We discuss the possibility that these three sub-populations reflect distinct and separable biological functions of the HMG-I protein.
2398616549	The invention relates to new antigenic proteins which can be used to simulate the immunity of cats (Felidae) against infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV), and to fragments or derivatives thereof. The invention also relates to vaccines which comprise such antigenic proteins or peptides. The nucleotide sequence and amine acid sequence of a gene coding for protein of an FIPV-strain are indicated in figure 1.
2398616663	Sonic extracts of Salmonella enteritidis, serotype enteritidis, contain a factor which inhibits eukaryotic cell-free protein synthesis tested on a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system and on a poly(U)-dependent system from Artemia salina embryos. The factor is heat-labile, does not diffuse through dialysis bags and is precipitated by ammonium sulphate. A 78% recovery of the factor was obtained in the 60-80 per cent ammonium sulphate saturation range, with a 3.3-fold purification. The factor binds to DEAE-cellulose. In the fraction eluted at 0.55 M NaCl, SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis shows only two protein bands (Mr 55,000 and 29,000). While the inhibitory activity on protein synthesis of the crude factor is fairly stable at 4 degrees C, it becomes very labile after DEAE-cellulose chromatography. The ID50 of the partially purified factor was less than 0.55 microgram (20-fold purification).

2398616942	The striatum is the major input station of the basal ganglia. It receives a wide variety of inputs from all areas of the cerebral cortex. In particular, there are several parallel loop circuits, such as the motor, oculomotor, dorsolateral prefrontal, lateral orbitofrontal, and anterior cingulate loops, linking the frontal lobe and the basal ganglia. With respect to the motor loop, the motor-related areas, including the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsal and ventral premotor cortices, presupplementary motor area, and rostral and caudal cingulate motor areas, send inputs to sectors of the putamen in combination via separate (parallel) and overlapping (convergent) pathways. Such signals return to the cortical areas of origin via the globus pallidus/substantia nigra and then the thalamus. The somatotopical representation is maintained in each structure that constitutes the motor loop. Employing retrograde transsynaptic transport of rabies virus, we have recently investigated the arrangement of multisynaptic pathways linking the basal ganglia to the caudal aspect of the dorsal premotor cortex (the so-called F2). F2r, the rostral sector of F2, has been shown to be involved in motor planning, whereas F2c, the caudal sector of F2, has been shown to be involved in motor execution. We analyzed the origins of multisynaptic inputs to F2r and F2c in the basal ganglia. Our results indicate that the 2 loop circuits connecting the F2r and F2c with the basal ganglia may possess a common convergent window at the input stage, while they have parallel divergent channels at the output stage.
2398617142	Physalins B and F were isolated and characterized from the ethanolic extract of the whole plant of Physalis angulata L. (Solanaceae). Both physalin B and physalin F inhibited the growth of several human leukemia cells: K562 (erythroleukemia), APM1840 (acute T lymphoid leukemia), HL-60 (acute promyelocytic leukemia), KG-1 (acute myeloid leukemia), CTV1 (acute monocytic leukemia) and B cell (acute B lymphoid leukemia). Physalin F showed a stronger activity against these leukemia cells than physalin B, especially against acute myeloid leukemia (KG-1) and acute B lymphoid leukemia (B cell). From the structural features, the active site seems to be the functional epoxy group for physalin F and the double bond for physalin B located at carbon 5 and 6; the former is much more active than the latter as regards anti-leukemic effects.
2398617152	In the two decades since the invention of DNA sequencing, only a tiny fraction of the human genome has been decoded—about 1% of the 3000 mega-base pair (Mbp) total. It is therefore somewhat daunting to consider that the Human Genome Project [[HN1][1]] has committed to completing the remaining 99%
2398617154	The effects of double, simultaneous, or successive lysogenisation of BSS strain ofS. aureus by two staphylococcal phages, both isolated from the same strain, have been studied. These phages (φRE andφD) are easily distinguished electronmicroscopically by the morphology of the virions as well as by the aspect of the plaques on the BSS. Lysogenization of BSS byφD is always accompanied by repression ofβ-haemolysin (conversion), but lysogenisation byφRE is only rarely accompanied by the loss of (δ-haemolysin (the frequency of the phenomenon suggests a transduction). In double lysogenization of BSS strain byφRE andφD, the sequence of lysogenisation does not, apparently, play an important role.

3139605386	The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway plays a vital role in cell proliferation, apoptosis, metabolism, and angiogenesis in various human cancers, including head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). In the present study, we aimed to clarify the role of AKT, which is a major downstream effector of the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway, in HNSCC. We first investigated the mRNA expression of AKT isoforms using RNA-sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. We observed a specific elevation of AKT3 expression in HNSCC tissues when compared with that in normal tissues. Furthermore, AKT3 expression correlated with genes related to the immunosuppressive microenvironment more than the other AKT isoforms and PIK3CA. Accordingly, we focused on AKT3 and performed a knockdown approach using an HNSCC cell line. AKT3 knockdown cells exhibited impaired proliferation, a shift in the cell cycle from G2/M to G1/G0 phase, an increase in apoptotic cells, and downregulation of gene expression related to immunosuppression, as well as the knockdown of its upstream regulator PIK3CA. We also performed immunohistochemistry for both AKT3 and PIK3CA using surgical specimens from 72 patients with HNSCC. AKT3 expression in tumor cells correlated with immune cell infiltration and unfavorable prognosis when compared with PIK3CA. These findings suggested that AKT3 expression is a potential biomarker for predicting the immunoreactivity and prognosis of HNSCC. Furthermore, the isoform-specific inhibition of AKT3 could be developed as a novel cancer therapy that efficiently suppresses the PI3K-AKT-mTOR pathway.
2398617711	Favourable burial conditions and self-limiting decomposition processes led to an extraordinarily well molecular preservation of the Mesolithic human skull finds from the Ofnet cave (district Nordlingen, Bavaria). Beyond the extraction of bone collagen, a selection of serum proteins from bone was identified immunologically. Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios from collagen gave clues to dietary behaviour including nursing practices. Diverging results after the application of biochemical protocols (for protein cleaning) and biophysical methods (for stable isotope analysis) are of particular interest: while the first approach failed to quantitatively eliminate anorganic contaminations, the second left some organic, exogenous residues in the samples. Thus, methods for protein extraction must vary according to problem solution and ultimate aim of the study. Taking this into account, application of invasive methods is also encouraged to rare and valuable skeletal finds.
2398617981	Mammalian monoclonal antibodies directed against the lipid A-core part of the endotoxin of gram (-) bacteria of different kinds, characterised in that the antigen used for immunising the immunocompetent cells is a complete lipopolysaccharide of gram (-) bacteria whose lipid A-core part is externalised.
2398618037	"HL-A typing of 144 NPC patients and 236 controls revealed an increased frequency of 1st locus HL-42 (relative risk = 2.24) and an increased frequency of unidentified antigens at the 2nd locus (relative risk = 2.60) in the NPC patients. HL-A2 and the 2nd locus ""blank"" appeared to act together (HL-A2 blank haplotype) in determining NPC risk in highest-risk Cantonese, whereas in relatively lower-risk non-Cantonese Chinese (Hokkiens, Teochews) they appeared to act independently. Only the ""blank"" had an increased frequency in Malay NPC patients. Thus there was an indication that the strength of the HL-A association with NPC reflected the 30-50-fold difference in incidence between highest-risk Cantonese and lowest-risk Indians. In Singapore, HL-A segregation patterns in families of nine Chinese NPC patients confirmed that the ""blank"" was a genetic phenomenon. A new 2nd locus antigen (Singapore-2) has recently been detected. Singapore-2 occurs more frequently in NPC patients and appears to be associated with a high risk for NPC. Since HL-A2 and Singapore-2 are not the risk factors, it is likely that the HL-A association with NPC reflects the existence of disease-susceptibility (DS) genes in linkage disequilibrium with alleles of the HL-A loci. It is proposed that NPC-DS genes may determine differences in immune responsiveness to environmental agents, and thereby determine differences in NPC incidence. If the known altered immune responsiveness of NPC patients to EBV reflects the function of DS genes linked to the high NPC risk HL-A type, then the hypothesis that Epstein-Barr virus has an etiological role in NPC can be tested by several types of prospective studies."
2398618110	The present invention comprises compounds of the general formula (1) in which R1 to R6 are each as defined in claim 1 which are suitable for treatment of disorders which are characterized by excessive or abnormal cell proliferation, and their use for producing a medicament with the aforementioned properties.
3139605587	In C. elegans, 283 clec genes encode a highly diverse family of C-type lectin-like domain (CTLD) proteins. Since vertebrate CTLD proteins have characterized functions in defense responses against pathogens and since expression of C. elegans clec genes is pathogen-dependent, it is generally assumed that clec genes function in C. elegans immune defenses. However, little is known about the relative contribution and exact function of CLEC proteins in C. elegans immunity. Here, we focused on the C. elegans clec gene clec-4, whose expression is highly upregulated by pathogen infection, and its paralogs clec-41 and clec-42. We found that, while mutation of clec-4 resulted in enhanced resistance to the Gram-positive pathogen Bacillus thuringiensis MYBt18247 (Bt247), inactivation of clec-41 and clec-42 by RNAi enhanced susceptibility to Bt247. Further analyses revealed that enhanced resistance of clec-4 mutants to Bt247 was due to an increase in feeding cessation on the pathogen and consequently a decrease in pathogen load. Moreover, clec-4 mutants exhibited feeding deficits also on non-pathogenic bacteria that were in part reflected in the clec-4 gene expression profile, which overlapped with gene sets affected by starvation or mutation in nutrient sensing pathways. However, loss of CLEC-4 function only mildly affected life-history traits such as fertility, indicating that clec-4 mutants are not subjected to dietary restriction. While CLEC-4 function appears to be associated with the regulation of feeding behavior, we show that CLEC-41 and CLEC-42 proteins likely function as bona fide immune effector proteins that have bacterial binding and antimicrobial capacities. Together, our results exemplify functional diversification within clec gene paralogs.
3139605653	PCR-SSCP technology was used to analyze the correlation of polymorphisms IGF2(Insulin-like growth factor) gene with carcass and meat quality traits in 186 Qinchuan cattle at the age of 24-month.C→T mutation in 120 and A→G mutation in 279 of IGF2 gene.Statistical analysis indicated that Qinchuan cattle with genotype BB and DD had significant differences in slaughter weight,carcass weight,carcass length,carcass chest depth and eye muscle area(P0.05).The dif- ference in thickness of back fat was significant(P0.01).Significant differences in marbling,tenderness,pH24 of meat qual- ity(P0.05),but the differences in carcass depth and water holding capacity were not significant(P0.05).Genotype AA, DD were predominant genotypes and A,D were predominant alleles.The population containing B,D allele had more excellent carcass and meat quality than others,especially in the capacity of fat accumulate
2398618239	Detachment from extracellular matrix causes metabolic defects that transformed cells must overcome in order to survive and proliferate outside of their normal niche. A recent report from Jiang et al. published in Nature describes how cancer cells grown in suspension utilize reductive carboxylation of glutamine to transfer reducing power from the cytosol to mitochondria to detoxify reactive oxygen species and promote anchorage-independent growth and survival.
2398618295	"Protein engineering is an emerging discipline that dovetails modern molecular biology techniques with high-throughput screening, laboratory evolution technologies, and computational approaches to modify sequence, structure, and, in some cases, function and properties of proteins. The ultimate goal is to develop new proteins with improved or designer functions for use in biotechnology, medicine, and basic research. One way to engineer proteins is to change their solvent-exposed regions through focused or random ""protein resurfacing."" In this review we explain what protein resurfacing is, and discuss recent examples of how this strategy is used to generate proteins with altered or broadened recognition profiles, improved stability, solubility, and expression, cell-penetrating ability, and reduced immunogenicity. Additionally we comment on how these properties can be further improved using chemical resurfacing approaches. Protein resurfacing will likely play an increasingly important role as more biologics enter clinical use, and we present some arguments to support this view."
2398618452	It is well known that the sex ratio at birth is a biological constant, being about 106 boys to 100 girls. However couples have always wanted to know and decide in advance the sex of a newborn. For example a large number of papers appeared connecting biometrical variables, such as length of follicular phase in the woman menstrual cycle or timing of intercourse acts to the sex of new baby. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian model to validate some of these theories by using an independent database. Results show that there is no effect of the follicular length on the sex of the bay. We also obtain a slightly larger probability, although not significant, of conceiving a female just after the mucus peak day.
2398618487	Summary The lung is an attractive organ for gene thera py due to the presence of cystic fibrosis and α 1 antitrypsin disorders whose genetic basis is known. However, low transfection efficiency, toxicity and immunogenicity issues have limited the success of the treatment strategies. In an attempt to overcome these limitations we formulated an anionic lipid-based vector using the heating method developed in our laboratory. The vector was characterised using atomic force microscopy and other techniques. The vector is completely non-toxic, possesses long term stability and is able to protect DNA from en zymatic degradation. The optimum ratio for transfection of human lung epithelial cells (16HBE14o-) was found to be 7:1 (lipid:DNA). These structures appear to be safe and effi cient in protection and delivery of DNA to the pulmonary tract.
3149555029	Eight indica (Oryza sativa L.) environment_sensitive genic male_sterile (EGMS) lines, 2_2S, K1405S, F131S, 2136S, Pei_Ai 64S, 1290S, GD_1S and N17S, were sequentially seeded with 10-15 d interval at three sites, Wuhan in 1997, Guiyang in 1997 and Sanya in 1997 and 1998, China. The results of investigations on self_sterilities showed that all of eight EGMS lines had stable sterile periods of longer than 30 d at Wuhan. They can be used for seed production of two_line hybrid rice, but can not reproduce themselves. Their stable sterile periods were shorter than 30 d at Guiyang, they can reproduce themselves and can not be used for hybrid seed production. In Sanya, their stable sterile periods were longer than 150 d, all of eight lines can be used for seed production in summer and autumn and reproduce themselves in winter. The fertility of all eight lines were sensitive to temperature. The sensitive stages, sensitive duration and critical point of temperatures (CPT) of fertility alteration in various lines were different. The sensitive stages of 2_2S and K1405S were from 18 d to 9 d before heading, the sensitive durations were 7-10 d and the CPTs were 23.7-24.5 ℃. The sensitive stage, sensitive duration and CPT of F131S were from 17 to 5 d before heading, 13 d and 24.3-24.7 ℃, respectively. The sensitive stage, sensitive duration and CPT of 2136S were from 18 to 12 d before heading, 7 d and 24.6-25.1 ℃, respectively. The sensitive stages, sensitive durations of Pei_Ai 64S, 1290S, N17S and GD_1S were from 24 to 13 d before heading and 10-13 d. And their CPTs were 24.6-25.1 ℃, 25.5-26.2 ℃, 25.4-26.1 ℃, and 24.1-24.7 ℃, respectively.
3149555349	Plant height is a typical quantitative trait that is liable to be influenced by genetic backgrounds and environments.As a novel research material,single segment substitution lines and double segment pyramiding lines in rice will make QTL identifica-tion and epistasis analysis more accurate because of diminishing the interference of genetic backgrounds among plants.In this study,Detection of QTLs controlling plant height and its components and analysis of epistasis effects were done with 16 secon-dary single segment substitution lines and 15 double segment pyramiding lines derived from crossing of primary SSSLs by ran-domized blocks design.The main results showed that 11 QTLs were detected and distributed on chromosomes 4,6,and 10,of which three QTLs controlling plant height,one QTL coffering length of the first inernode from the top,two QTLs harboring length of the second internode from the top,two QTLs for length of the third internode from the top and three QTL controlling length of the fourth internode from the top were included.Twenty-three digenic interactions were detected for plant height and its components,of which 7 interactions occurred between two loci both not having main effects on the traits,and 16 interactions each involved one locus having a main effect at the single-locus level and another locus that did not show significant effect at the sin-gle-locus level.The results indicated that both additive effects of QTL and epistasis effects between QTLs were important genetic components.Efficiency of QTLs identification and epistasis effects analysis between QTLs could be improved using secondary single segment substitution lines and double segment pyramiding lines derived from crossing of primary single segment substitu-tion lines.
2398619016	Tissue regeneration strategies have traditionally relied on designing biomaterials that closely mimic features of the native extracellular matrix (ECM) as a means to potentially promote site-specific cellular behaviors. However, inflammation, while a necessary component of wound healing, can alter processes associated with successful tissue regeneration following an initial injury. These processes can be further magnified by the implantation of a biomaterial within the wound site. In addition to designing biomaterials to satisfy biocompatibility concerns as well as to replicate elements of the composition, structure, and mechanics of native tissue, we propose that ECM analogs should also include features that modulate the inflammatory response. Indeed, strategies that enhance, reduce, or even change the temporal phenotype of inflammatory processes have unique potential as future pro-regenerative analogs. Here, we review derivatives of three natural materials with intrinsic anti-inflammatory properties and discuss their potential to address the challenges of inflammation in tissue engineering and chronic wounds.
2398619287	Objective To investigate the single nucleotide polymorphism of the promoter of HLA-DQB1(QBP)in Chinese Han patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.Methods Case-control design wag applied.Eighty-eight Chinese Han patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and 88 non-Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome controls were admitted.DNA wag extracted from the peripheral white blood cells of the subjects by the phenol-chloroform method.Polymerage chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism(PCR-SSCP)and clone-sequencing were applied to determine the sequences of the promoter of HLA-DQB1.Chromas and Bioedit software were used to analyze the sequences of the promoter of HLA-DQB1.Chi-square test and Fisher exact test were applied to compare the frequencies of bands of QBPs and SNPs for the two groups.Results Sixteen band patterns of HLA-QBP were shown by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis(PAGE).The band frequencies of QBPb(corresponding gene sequence was QBP2.1+77C＞A,χ2=26.01,Pc＜0.001)and QBP1(corresponding gene sequence was QBP3.3,χ2=16.99,Pc＜0.001)were significantly higher in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome than that in normal controls(Pc＜0.001).However,the frequencies of QBPg(corresponding gene sequence wag QBP3.1,χ2=12.10,Pc＜0.05)and QSPn(corresponding gene sequence wag QBP6.1+39G＞A,χ2=14.64,Pc＜0.05)were significantly lower in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome than those of the controls.Twelve SNPs were found in all subjects.The frequency of C allele at position-189C/A in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome was significantly higher than that in controls(χ2=45.92,P=0.000).However,the frequency of G allele at position-227G/A in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome Was significantly lower as compared with that in the normal controls(χ2=15.63,P=0.000).Conclusions C allele of-189C/A is a genetically susceptible factor of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome and G allele of-227G/A is the protective factor of Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada syndrome.

2398619453	Inhibin is a glycoproteic hormone mostly produced by the gonads. Through a feedback at the pituitary level, it selectively inhibits the release of follicle-stimulating hormone. In mammals, inhibin has been found also in some extragonadal tissues such as placenta, pituitary, adrenal, spleen, kidney, brain and spinal cord. At present, no information is available about the existence of inhibin in reptiles. The aim of the present work is to localise, through immunocytochemical methods, the sites of inhibin production in male lizards during the main phases of the reproductive cycle: the culmination phase (April-June), the early regressive phase (early July), the maximal regressive phase (August) and the winter stasis (January). In the testis, immunostaining is mainly localised in the Leydig cells during the early regressive phase, while it is observed in the Sertoli cells during the maximal regressive phase. In the epididymis, the immunostaining is present only during the reproductive period at the level of secreting cells and inside its ducts. In the adrenal gland, after immunostaining, both chromaffin and steroidogenetic tissues are inhibin-positive during the whole spermatogenetic cycle, though with variable intensity throughout the year: cross-reaction appears more evident from January to April (winter stasis and culmination phase) and weaker in June. However, in captive animals, the reaction persists in chromaffin cells, but disappears in steroidogenetic cells. The functional meaning of the presence of inhibin as a factor in the local regulation of spermatogenesis is discussed.
2398619527	The effect of oxidative stress on the rat small intestine was investigated by pretreatment of isolated segments from the jejunum with hydrogen peroxide or cumene hydroperoxide. Both peroxides induced responses in the small intestine, viz. a contraction followed by a slow relaxation. The contraction could be blocked by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin and the phospholipase A2 inhibitor quinacrine, suggesting a role for prostaglandins in the response. Pretreatment of intestinal segments with the peroxides diminished the muscarinic cholinergic response to methacholine. The lipoxygenase inhibitor nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) both protected against the damage induced by cumene hydroperoxide, but did not influence the effect of hydrogen peroxide on the muscarinic response. In contrast to hydrogen peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide induced lipid peroxidation in intestinal membranes, which could also be blocked by NDGA or BHT. We conclude that cumene hydroperoxide alters the muscarinic response in the rat jejunum by the induction of lipid peroxidation, whereas the damage by hydrogen peroxide is probably induced intracellularly.
2398619533	The tumor suppressor gene p53 has been shown to be mutated in 50% of acute lymphoblastic T-cell-leukemia (T-ALL) cell lines, all of which were established from T-ALL cases in relapse. In these lines both alleles of the p53 gene were independently affected by point mutation. In contrast, in human solid tumors possessing a mutated p53 allele, the second wild-type p53 suppressor allele is often lost by deletion rather than altered by mutation. This suggests that in T-ALL cell lines, the product encoded by the second mutated allele provides the cells with an additional oncogenic stimulus, beyond the loss of suppressive activity
2398619605	The in vitro microculture technique was used to develop a relatively simple bioassay for estimating chloroquine (CQ) in plasma or serum. Chloroquine concentrations were determined by multiplying the maximum inhibitory dilution of plasma/serum required to inhibit growth of the CQ-sensitive FC27 isolate of Plasmodium falciparum by the minimum inhibitory concentration of CQ against the same isolate. Human serum samples spiked with CQ gave similar measurements using both bioassay and high-performance liquid chromatography. The antimalarial activity of plasma or serum samples collected from 13 patients treated with CQ was equivalent to the sum of the combined activity of CQ and its metabolite, mono-desethylchloroquine. The concentration of these components using the bioassay could be expressed conveniently in terms of CQ concentration equivalents. This bioassay can be used to estimate drug concentrations without the use of sophisticated methods or equipment. Since it is based on the microculture technique, it can be easily carried out in conjunction with the drug susceptibility test to assess CQ treatment failures in malaria patients.

2398619785	Melanoblasts (MBs) are melanocyte precursors that are derived from neural crest cells (NCCs). We recently demonstrated the multipotency of MBs; they differentiate not only into pigmented melanocytes but also other NCC derivatives. We herein describe methods for the isolation of MBs from mouse skin by flow cytometry. Methods to culture isolated MBs that retain their multipotency and isolation methods for MBs using gene-modified mouse are also described.
3139606264	This study was conducted to investigate the effects of Clostridium butyricum on growth performance, immune function, and cecal microflora in broiler chickens challenged with Escherichia coli K88. Three hundred sixty 1-d-old broiler chickens were randomly divided into 4 treatments: negative control (NC) birds were fed a basal diet and not challenged with E. coli K88; positive control (PC) birds were fed a basal diet and challenged with E. coli K88; C. butyricum treatment (CB) birds were fed a diet containing 2 × 107 cfu C. butyricum/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88; and colistin sulfate treatment (CS) birds were fed a diet containing 20 mg of colistin sulfate/kg of diet and challenged with E. coli K88. Birds fed CB had greater (P < 0.05) BW than the PC birds from 3 to 21 d postchallenge. Birds fed CB had greater (P < 0.05) serum IgA and IgY at 14 d postchallenge, greater (P < 0.05) serum IgM at 21 d postchallenge, and greater (P < 0.05) mucosal secreted IgA at 3 and 7 d postchallenge than the PC birds. Birds fed CB had greater concentrations of serum complement component 3 at 14 d postchallenge, and greater (P < 0.05) concentrations of serum complement component 4 at 3, 7, and 14 d postchallenge than the PC birds. Birds in the CS or CB treatments had less cecal E. coli population at 3, 7, and 21 d postchallenge, and less cecal Clostridium perfringens counts at 21 d postchallenge compared with the PC birds. The CB treatment increased (P < 0.05) the population of cecal Lactobacillus at 3 d postchallenge and the number of cecal Bifidobacterium at 3, 14, and 21 d postchallenge in comparison with the PC treatment. The results indicate that dietary supplementation of CB promotes growth performance, improves immune function, and benefits the cecal microflora in Escherichia coli K88-challenged chickens.

3149555457	By surveying the 70 composting plants in Gyeonggi Province, the total commercial production of livestock faeces composts (LFCs) in 2008 was estimated to be about 480,000 Mg year-1 and they were manufactured mainly by using both mechanical mixer and bottom air blower. LFCs were composed mainly of chicken faeces 29.2%, pig+chicken faeces 23.1%, pig faeces 20.0%, livestock faeces+oil cake 12.3%, pig+ chicken+cattle faeces 10.8% and pig+cattle faeces 4.6%. On the basis of the current official standard which was revised on March 2010, 11 composts out of surveyed 76 ones did not meet the LFCs quality standard (LQS) due to inadequate content of water (5), OM/N (1), NaCl (2) and Zn (3). The OM/N declined by adding chicken faeces and oil cake, while Ca content increased by the addition of chicken faeces and NaCl increased by adding cattle faeces.
3149555500	Avaliacoes estatisticas do uso de racao extrusada e peletizada, em cultivos do camarao Litopenaeus vannamei, nas condicoes de campo, foram realizadas com o objetivo de determinar as vantagens sobre os indices zootecnicos dos camaroes. Analises foram feitas utilizando-se 481 cultivos, provenientes de oito fazendas comerciais do nordeste do Brasil.

Para densidades de 60 camaroes/m2 a diferenca no FCA foi de 18,8% menor quando se utilizou racao peletizada, a producao foi 7,2% maior utilizando-se racao peletizada, o consumo de racao foi 8,5% menor com racao peletizada e a produtividade foi 10,3% maior quando a racao extrusada foi utilizada.
2398619855	Two studies of experimentally induced Brucella abortus infections in dogs are reported. Twenty dogs in experiment 1 were fed approximately 4.8 X 10(10) colony forming units of B. abortus strain 2308 (BA 2308), and 11 dogs in experiment 2 were fed approximately 3.4 X 10(14) BA 2308. Serum samples from each infected dog and noninfected control were tested on the day of infection and at weekly and biweekly intervals post-infection (PI) for antibodies to B. abortus. The standard tube agglutination (STA) and rivanol (RIV) mean log-titers of the infected dogs in the 2 experiments were compared statistically on the day of infection and on PI days 7, 14, 21, 35, 42 and 49. The STA and RIV titers of the infected dogs in experiment 2 were significantly higher than were those of the dogs in experiment 1. Brucella abortus was isolated from 29 infected dogs in experiments 1 and 2 including 10 dogs, which were seronegative when cultured.
2398619883	Pneumonia is considered to be one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The outcome depends on both, proper antibiotic treatment and the effectivity of the immune response of the host. However, due to the complexity of the immunologic cascade initiated during infection, the latter cannot be predicted easily. We construct a biomathematical model of the murine immune response during infection with pneumococcus aiming at predicting the outcome of antibiotic treatment. The model consists of a number of non-linear ordinary differential equations describing dynamics of pneumococcal population, the inflammatory cytokine IL-6, neutrophils and macrophages fighting the infection and destruction of alveolar tissue due to pneumococcus. Equations were derived by translating known biological mechanisms and assuming certain response kinetics. Antibiotic therapy is modelled by a transient depletion of bacteria. Unknown model parameters were determined by fitting the predictions of the model to data sets derived from mice experiments of pneumococcal lung infection with and without antibiotic treatment. Time series of pneumococcal population, debris, neutrophils, activated epithelial cells, macrophages, monocytes and IL-6 serum concentrations were available for this purpose. The antibiotics Ampicillin and Moxifloxacin were considered. Parameter fittings resulted in a good agreement of model and data for all experimental scenarios. Identifiability of parameters is also estimated. The model can be used to predict the performance of alternative schedules of antibiotic treatment. We conclude that we established a biomathematical model of pneumococcal lung infection in mice allowing predictions regarding the outcome of different schedules of antibiotic treatment. We aim at translating the model to the human situation in the near future.
2398619887	One hundred and sixty Columbia- and Suffolk-cross intact male and female growing lambs (8 wk of age) were used in an 84-d feeding trial to determine the effect of two levels dietary Ca and Zn on weight gain, feed utilization and several blood and tissue traits. Two levels of Ca (.5 and .8%) and two levels of Zn (20 and 100 ppm) were fed in a 2 X 2 factorial arrangement of dietary treatments. There was no effect of diet on performance or on blood traits. Columbia lambs had heavier fleeces at slaughter than Suffolks (P less than .01) and males had heavier fleeces than females (P less than .01). Based on the similarity in performance among lambs fed the four diets differing in Ca and Zn level, it is concluded that a dietary Ca level of .5% and a Zn level of 19 to 26 ppm is adequate for normal weight gain, feed utilization, liver and humerus ash concentrations and blood plasma concentrations of Ca, P, Zn, total protein, albumin, alkaline phosphatase and blood hemoglobin and hematocrit. Further, it appears that an elevated level of dietary Ca does not precipitate a clinical Zn deficiency in the growing lamb, in contrast to the general observation in growing swine.
2398619901	Pancreatic cancer, like most other cancers, is fundamentally caused by mutations in specific genes. Many of the genes targeted in pancreatic cancer have been identified in the past decade, and an understanding of these genes and their function has helped identify familial forms of pancreatic cancer, define the precursor lesions from which invasive pancreatic cancers arise, and will soon lead to gene-specific therapies for this disease. This article reviews the tumor-suppressor genes, oncogenes, and DNA repair genes targeted in pancreatic cancer, and presents clinical applications based on our understanding of the genetic basis of pancreatic cancer.
2398620029	OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: The presence of oxytocin (OT) and its putative participation to the phenotypic plasticity of CRH neurones in the stressed jerboa was investigated. We analysed by immunocytochemistry the OT expression within the hypothalamic parvicellular paraventricular nucleus (pPVN) of male jerboas submitted to an acute immobilization (30 min). RESULTS: OT presence was clearly demonstrated in the pPVN of the jerboa and no significant difference in the number of OT immunolabeled cells was observed whatever the experimental conditions. Interestingly, CRH-immunoreactive neurons coexpressed OT within cell bodies and terminals in a similar way both in control and stressed animals. The level of coexpression was regionally heterogeneous and was not sensitive to the stress immobilization. CONCLUSION: The present data reveal for the first time the occurrence of OT in hypothalamic pPVN neurons of the jerboa. Moreover, this OT expression level does not change upon an acute immobilization stress. These new data, coupled together with our previous work in the jerboa, incontestably establish a clear dichotomy between a stress-responsive CRH/CCK system and a stress non-responsive OT/VP system in the pPVN.
2398620385	Revertant somatic mosaicism has been described in an increasing number of genetic disorders including primary immunodeficiency diseases. Both back mutations leading to restoration of wild-type sequences and second-site mutations resulting in compensatory changes have been demonstrated in mosaic individuals. Recent studies identifying revertant somatic mosaicism caused by multiple independent genetic changes further support its frequent occurrence in primary immunodeficiency diseases. Revertant mosaicism acquires a particular clinical relevance because it may lead to selective growth advantage of the corrected cells, resulting in improvement of disease symptoms or atypical clinical presentations. This phenomenon also provides us unique opportunities to evaluate the biological effects of restored gene expression in different cell lineages. Here we review the recent findings of revertant somatic mosaicism in primary immunodeficiency diseases and discuss its clinical implications.
3149555862	Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, characterized by progressive loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, intraneuronal deposition of misfolded proteins known as Lewy bodies, and chronic neuroinflammation. PD can arise from monogenic mutations, but in most cases, the etiology is unclear. Viral infection is gaining increasing attentions as a trigger of PD. In this study, we investigated whether the PD-causative 620 aspartate (D) to asparagine (N) mutation in the vacuolar protein sorting 35 ortholog (Vps35) precipitated herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. We observed that ectopic expression of Vps35 significantly reduced the proliferation and release of HSV-1 virions; the D620N mutation rendered Vps35 a partial loss of such inhibitory effects. Tetherin is a host cell protein capable of restricting the spread of encapsulated viruses including HSV-1 and SARS-Cov-2, both of which are implicated in the development of parkinsonism. Compared with cells overexpressing wildtype Vps35, cells expressing mutant Vps35 with D620N had less Tetherin on cell surfaces. Real-time and static cell imaging revealed that Tetherin recycled through Vps35-positive endosomes. Expression of Vps35 with D620N reduced endosomal dynamics and frequency of motile Tetherin-containing vesicles, a sign of defective production of recycling carriers. Our study suggests that the D620N mutation in Vps35 hinders Tetherin trafficking to cell surfaces and facilitates virus spread.

3149556314	Abstract We describe the first reported intergeneric hybrid to naturally occur between two subspecies belonging to different genera, Dactylorhiza fuchsii subsp. sooana (genus Dactylorhiza) and Pseudorchis albida subsp. tricuspis (genus Pseudorchis), as × Pseudorhiza nieschalkii (Senghas) P.F.Hunt nothosubsp. siculorum H.Kertesz & N.Anghelescu, 2020. The hybrid was found and digitally photographed for the first time by Hajnalka Kertesz in June, 2020, within Terra Siculorum, in one of the Natura 2000 protected areas, known as Harghita Madaras, ROSCI00090. Following detailed morphometric analysis using 67 characters and molecular karyological analyses, we identified this unique specimen as an intergeneric hybrid, new to science. The hybrid, an F1 generation plant, most likely representing a single intergeneric pollination event, is phenotypically intermediate between its parental species in most of the characters scored, but it significantly closely resembles Pseudorchis albida subsp. tricuspis parent. Since the parental species occurred in near proximity (1-10 meters distance), we suggest that the production of this hybrid required a minimum travel distance of ca 1-10 meters, by the pollinators and frequent exchange of pollen between the parental species was very likely. The parental species and the hybrid, which display a considerable synchronicity in their flowering time, overlap in pollinator community, sharing various species of Hymenopterans and Dipterans, very abundant in the heathland. This Terra Siculorum hybrid is thus best described as a rarely occurring intergeneric hybrid that shows strong Pseudorchis albida subsp. tricuspis parental dominance in inheritance patterns.
3149556377	Abbot (Jour. Exp. Zool. Nov. 1918) finds that the land isopods, Oniscus and Porcellio, are negatively phototactic to all intensities from 0.01 C.M. to 100 C.M., whenever not immersed in water. He concludes that the orientation is direct and not by selection of random movements; and that this negative phototaxis is apparently a factor in fitting them for life on land by aiding to keep them in a suitably moist habitat. The negative quality is more pronounced in Oniscus, which has the more restricted habitat.
3149556628	An eight week study was conducted in which cattle rumen epithelial tissue scrapings meal (CRETSM) was substituted for fishmeal in growing rabbit diets to reduce feed formulation cost and environmental pollution. One hundred and twenty growing rabbits were divided into six groups of twenty rabbits each which was assigned to six diets that had 0, 20, 40, 60 80 and 100 percent fishmeal in it replaced with CRETSM in a Completely Randomized Design. Data collected were feed intake, weight gain, feed : gain ratio, production cost, carcass characteristics and nutrient digestibility. Data were analyzed by ANOVA. Weight gained by the rabbits fed 0, 20, 40, 60 and 80 percent fishmeal in their diets replaced were similar but were higher (p<0.05) than that fed only CRETSM. Similar trend was observed in carcass weight and protein digestibility. Feed cost decreased with increase level of CRETSM in the diets while production cost was lower for the rabbits fed diets that contained CRETSM. Poor feed utilization was observed in the rabbits fed only CRETSM. Feed intake, organ weights and nutrient digestibility were unaffected. It was concluded that CRETSM can replace 80% fishmeal in growing rabbit diet.

3149556659	Background and Aims Early developmental events in microsporogenesis are known to play a role in pollen morphology: variation in cytokinesis type, cell wall formation, tetrad shape and aperture polarity are responsible for pollen aperture patterning. Despite the existence of other morphologies, monosulcate pollen is one of the most common aperture types in monocots, and is also considered as the ancestral condition in this group. It is known to occur from either a successive or a simultaneous cytokinesis. In the present study, the developmental sequence of microsporogenesis is investigated in several species of Asparagales that produce such monosulcate pollen, representing most families of this important monocot clade. Methods The developmental pathway of microsporogenesis was investigated using light transmission and epifluorescence microscopy for all species studied. Confocal microscopy was used to confirm centripetal cell plate formation. Key Results Microsporogenesis is diverse in Asparagales, and most variation is generally found between families. It is confirmed that the whole higher Asparagales clade has a very conserved microsporogenesis, with a successive cytokinesis and centrifugal cell plate formation. Centripetal cell wall formation is described in Tecophilaeaceae and Iridaceae, a feature that had so far only been reported for eudicots. Conclusions Monosulcate pollen can be obtained from several developmental pathways, leading thus to homoplasy in the monosulcate character state. Monosulcate pollen should not therefore be considered as the ancestral state unless it is produced through the ancestral developmental pathway. The question about the ancestral developmental pathway leading to monosulcy remains open. a 2004 Annals of Botany Company
2398620618	New biochemically marked Djungarian hamster cell line (DX-TK-) was established. These cells are resistant to 5-bromodeoxyuridine (25 mkg/ml) and deficient in thymidine kinase activity (TK-). Due to this biochemical defect they have lost the ability to grow in HAT medium. DX-TK- cells are malignant. They grow as tumours after the inoculation to newborn Djungarian hamsters. Tumorigenecity of DX-TK- cells was decreased as compared with the parent TK+ cell line. DX-TK- cell line is a hypodiploid cell culture (26 chromosomes) with 7 chromosome markers easily identified by means of G-band staining. This line is a new model for somatic cell genetic experiments, particularly for somatic cell hybridization.
2398620912	Streptomyces sp. AD001 is a Gram-positive soil actinomycetes secreting an uncharacterized 2,4-dichlorophenol (DCP) oxidizing enzyme, whose activity is similar to the previously known Actinomycetes lignin-peroxidase (ALiP). This extracellular peroxidase was purified from Streptomyces sp. AD001 as a single protein band on an SDS-PAGE by ammonium sulfate fractionation, Q-sepharose, concanavalin A, and Bio-Gel HTP column chromatographies. The molecular mass of the purified peroxidase was determined by SDS-PAGE to be 45.2 kDa, and 49.7 kDa with MALDI-TOF-MS, respectively. The highest level of peroxidase activity was observed at pH 7.5 and 30 o C. The amino terminal sequence of the purified peroxidase (G-E-P-E-E-G-N-V-D-G-T-L) showed no significant homologies to any known proteins, suggesting that Streptomyces sp. AD001 may secrete a novel kind of bacterial peroxidase. Initial rate kinetic data of the 2,4-DCP oxidation were best modeled with a random-binding bireactant system.
2398621014	We have previously shown that extrathymic rearrangements of T-cell receptor (TcR) gamma and delta chain genes occur in the peripheral lymphoid tissues of athymic nude mice. To further determine where the TcR gene rearrangements occur in nude mice, we investigated the rearrangement and expression of the TcR genes in the long-term cultured bone marrow (LTBM) cells which were homogenous in developments without mature T cells as assessed by FACS analysis. The LTBM derived from euthymic mice contained TcR gamma and delta chain genes in germline configuration, while gene rearrangements of both locus were detected in the LTBM cells from nude mice. These results suggested that gamma and delta gene rearrangements do occur in the bone marrow cells of nude mice and that the T-cell precursors in bone marrow may be increased in frequency in such animals.
3139606571	The powerful quantitative genetic design of identical and fraternal twins reared apart (112 pairs) and matched twins reared together (111 pairs) was employed to assess the extent of genetic influence on individual differences in cognitive abilities during the last half of the life span. General cognitive ability yielded a heritability estimate of about .80 in two assessments 3 years apart as part of the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging. This is one of the highest heritabilities reported for a behavioral trait. Across the two ages, average heritabilities are about .60 for verbal tests, .50 for spatial and speedof-processing tests, and .40 for memory tests. For general cognitive ability, the phenotypic stability across the 3 years is .92 and stable genetic factors account for nearly 90% this stability. These findings suggest that general cognitive ability is a reasonable target for research that aims to identify specific genes for complex traits.

3149557298	Critical to conservation efforts and other investigations at low taxonomic levels, DNA sequence data offer important insights into the distinctiveness, biogeographic partitioning and evolutionary histories of species. The resolving power of DNA sequences is often limited by insufficient variability at the intraspecific level. This is particularly true of studies involving plant organelles, as the conservative mutation rate of chloroplasts and mitochondria makes it difficult to detect polymorphisms necessary to track genealogical relationships among individuals, populations and closely related taxa, through space and time. Massively parallel sequencing (MPS) makes it possible to acquire entire organelle genome sequences to identify cryptic variation that would be difficult to detect otherwise. We are using MPS to evaluate intraspecific chloroplast-level divergence across biogeographic boundaries in narrowly endemic and widespread species of Pinus. We focus on one of the world’s rarest pines – Torrey pine (Pinus torreyana) – due to its conservation interest and because it provides a marked contrast to more widespread pine species. Detailed analysis of nearly 90% (� 105 000 bp each) of these chloroplast genomes shows that mainland and island populations of Torrey pine differ at five sites in their plastome, with the differences fixed between populations. This is an exceptionally low level of divergence (1 polymorphism ⁄ � 21 kb), yet it is comparable to intraspecific divergence present in widespread pine species and species complexes. Population-level organelle genome sequencing offers new vistas into the timing and magnitude of divergence within species, and is certain to provide greater insight into pollen dispersal, migration patterns and evolutionary dynamics in plants.

3149558173	Background and Aims: The influenza virus hemagglutinin is the major surface protein of the influenza A virus which is composed of HA1 and HA2 subunits. HA1 has an important role in  binding of virus to cells and designing neutralizing antibodies. Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) and Bacillus subtilis ( B. subtilis ) both are known as the most useful prokaryotic hosts to express recombinant proteins. The aim of this study was to clone and express recombinant HA1 protein in E. coli and B. subtilis bacteria. Material and Methods: HA1 gene was cloned into pET-28a vector and pHT43 shuttle vector and then, both transformed to E. coli . The recombinant plasmids were extracted and then transformed into the BL21 and WB600 as expressing hosts. After induction with isopropyl-β-d-thiogalactoside (IPTG), expressed recombinant protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Finally, the expressed protein was confirmed by the Western blot. Results: The accuracy of pET-28a-HA1 construct was confirmed by colony PCR and enzymatic digestion analysis. Emerging bands with the expected molecular weight on SDS-PAGE confirmed the successful expression in two hosts. Conclusion: This study demonstrated a strategy for production and purification of recombinant protein in large scale to test as vaccine candidate against influenza and it’s potentially immunogenicity be assessed in animal models.
3149558491	SUMMARY During a recent large tularemia outbreak in Bulgaria we found several cases that were remote from the main focus. One case had an unusual mode of transmission. A hunter acquired tularemia through a nail scratch from a buzzard (Buteo buteo) and consequently developed a typical ulceroglandular form of the disease. The diagnosis was confirmed by serological methods and successful cultivation. Comparative strain typing was performed by high-resolution multi-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The isolated strain was identical to one of the outbreak genotypes. We consider that this case represents a bird-to-human transmission of F. tularensis.

3149559228	Plant-based mosquito control methods may use as a supplementary malaria vector control strategy. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of smoking ethno-medicinal plants on indoor density and feeding activity of malaria vectors at early hours of the night and its residual effect after midnight in southern Ethiopia. Both field and tent trials were conducted to evaluate the impact of smoking Juniperus procera leaves, Eucalyptus globulus seeds and Olea europaea leaves in Kolla Shara Village from July 2016 to February 2017. For the field trial, five grass-thatched traditional huts (three for ethno-medicinal plants and two as control [only charcoal smoking and non-charcoal smoking]) were used. Indoor host-seeking mosquitoes were collected by CDC light traps. A Latin square design was employed to minimize the bias due to the variation in house location and different sampling nights. For the tent experiment, 25 3–5-day-old starved wild female Anopheles mosquitoes reared from the larvae were released into the tents where a calf was tethered at the mid-point of each tent. A total of 614 Anopheles mosquitoes belonging to 5 species were collected from 5 huts, of which 93.4% was An. arabiensis; O. europaea, E. globulus and J. procera reduced the indoor density of An. arabiensis, with the mean percentage drop of 80%, 73% and 70%, respectively. In the tent trial, smoking of these plants had significant knockdown effects and inhibited feeding on the calves (F = 383.5, DF = 3, P < 0.01). The mean knockdown effect due to O. europaea was relatively high (17.7 ± 0.54; 95% CI 16.8–18.6), while it was only 0.9 ± 0.1 (95% CI 0.29–1.52) in the control tents. All the test plants used in the tent trial caused significantly inhibited feeding activity of An. arabiensis on the host (F = 383.5, DF = 3, P < 0.01). About 94.5%, 89.5% and 86% of mosquitoes were unfed because of the smoking effect of O. europaea, E. globulus and J. procera, respectively, whereas only 19.5% were unfed in the control tent. Smoking ethno-medicinal plant materials reduced indoor density of malaria vectors and inhibited feeding on calves inside the tents. Thus, plant-based mosquito control methods may play a vital role in reducing mosquito bites in the early hours of the night and thereby reduce residual malaria transmission.
3149559266	To extend 8 BAC contigs, which were previously located in the 56.1—68 cM region of the chromosome 4 of the Oryza sativa indica GuangLuAi4, 14 pairs of primers were designed according to the terminal sequences of the existing seed BACs and were deliberately divided into 3 groups. With the 3 groups of primer mixtures, 233 pools of BAC DNA that represent 22 368 BAC clones from O.sativa indica GuangLuAi4 genomic library were screened. 65 positive clones corresponding to the 8 contigs were isolated and 29 clones of them were confirmed to be extended to the seed BACs by end-sequencing and fingerprinting. The protocol greatly enhanced the efficiency of the contig extension and was also superior for its specificity, sensitivity and reusability to the colony in situ hybridization which is a conventional method employed in contig extension and physical map construction.

2055233543	The Iroquois (Irx) genes encode evolutionary conserved homeoproteins. We report that Xenopus genes Irx1 and Irx3 are expressed and required during different stages of Xenopus pronephros development. They are initially expressed during mid-neurulation in domains extending over most of the prospective pronephric territory. Expression onset takes place after kidney anlage specification, but before pronephric organogenesis occurs. Later, during nephron segmentation, expression becomes restricted to the intermediate tubule region of the proximal-distal axis. Loss- and gain-of-function analyses, performed with specific morpholinos and inducible wild-type and dominant-negative constructs, reveal a dual requirement for Irx1 and Irx3 during pronephros development. During neurula stages, these genes maintain the specification of the pronephric territory and define its size. This seems to occur, at least in part, through positive regulation of Bmp signalling. Subsequently, Irx genes are required for proper formation of the intermediate tubule. Finally, we find that retinoic acid signalling activates both Irx1 and Irx3 genes in the pronephros.
2055233589	Diversification of the primary antibody repertoire occurs in young rabbit appendix. As a prelude to molecular investigation of whether human appendix has a similar role, we compared the lymphoid morphology and distribution of common B- and T-cell subsets in frozen and/or paraffin-embedded normal appendix specimens at various ages. IgA, IgM and IgG staining patterns were similar in frozen human and rabbit appendices. The elongated follicles of the young human and rabbit appendices regressed with age to resemble Peyer's patches. Although similar in morphology to the bursa, human and rabbit appendix follicles differ in that they do not involute completely with age and contain significant numbers of germinal center (GC) T cells although the number is low early in life. If the human appendix functions as a primary lymphoid organ, it may occur during the first few months of age when the GC T-cell density is low.
2055233596	Summary. Gonadotrophin-like activity in the cultures of mouse placentae, from Days 10 to 18 of gestation, was determined by using a sensitive mouse Leydig cell testosterone bioassay. Thelimit of detection of the bioassay was 0\m=.\05mi.u. for the 2nd International Standard of hCG. Serial dilution of placental culture media gave dose\p=n-\responsecurves parallel to those of the hCG standard. Gonadotrophin-like activity was detected in cultures of placentae from different stages of gestation, and a biphasic variation appeared: the first peak of activity was present at Day 12 (0\m=.\853 \m=+-\0\m=.\070mi.u. hCG) while the second appeared on Day 17 of gestation (0\m=.\595 \m=+-\ 0\m=.\093mi.u. hCG). These results suggest that the mouse placenta is capable of secreting a gonadotrophin-like factor in vitro.
2055233601	There is much concern about the increasing presence in the environment of synthetic chemicals that are able to disrupt the endocrine system. Among these compounds, 4-nonylphenol (4-NP) is one of the most studied xenoestrogens, due to its widespread accumulation in water sediment and consequent presence in fatty acid of aquatic organisms. Here, we have used a zebrafish microarray representing 16,399 genes to study the effects of 4-NP and estradiol-17beta (E2) in adult male zebrafish in order to elucidate the mechanism of action of 4-NP compared with that of E2. The microarray results showed that both 4-NP and E2 induced a strong expression of vitellogenin (VTG), the sex related precursor of the yolk proteins in oviparous vertebrates. Both treatments induced elevated protein turnover upregulating genes involved in proteolysis and those that are constituents of the ribosome. Many genes regulated by 4-NP and E2 are involved in energy metabolism, oxidative stress defense mechanisms, xenobiotic metabolism, and lipid metabolism. A different pattern of expression in the two treatments was found for genes involved in oxidative stress, since E2 seems to induce the mechanism of detoxification, while 4-NP seems to inhibit this protective mechanism of the cell. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the microarray approach can contribute significantly to the understanding of expression patterns induced by E2 and 4-NP in male zebrafish. The results also demonstrate that 4-NP is able to act through an alternative pattern to that of estradiol-17beta, modulating the expression of the same genes in a different manner.
2055233682	Abstract Group-0 turbot Scophthalmus maximus L. were fed on artificial diets for 13 months, at 15° C. Partially defined diets containing about 40% protein were used and fish were fed once per day with moist pellets. The mean weight of the fish, at the beginning of the experiment, was 3.5 g. During the first 6 months, a fish gained 15 g weight on average, and 40 g in the following 6 months. The final mean weight was 62 g, and the final mean total length, 15.3 cm. The daily growth rate was 0.7% and the protein efficiency ratio (P.E.R.) ranged between 1.4 and 2.1. For fish fed on natural food at 15° C, the results were similar for the first 9 months. Subsequently, these fish grew faster than those fed artificial diets.
2055233719	Adjustments in the geometry of the separation zone of an inclined parallel plate sedimenter, previously developed, permitted an extensive increase in the volumetric clarification rate of broth containing yeast (S. cerevisiae). The prototype, having an internal capacity of 1340 ml, was fed with fermentation broth containing 18.8% v/v cells, while 16.4 ml/min of clarified broth containing 0.3% v/v cells was removed in the overflow. The underflow, containing 23.8% v/v cells, was recycled to the fermenter at a rate of 60.6 ml/min. These results demonstrated the viability of using exclusively gravitational sedimentation for cellular recycling in continuous alcoholic fermentation. Without a doubt, this system represents the simplest technological alternative among those thus far proposed for continuous alcoholic fermentation. The low cost of installation, maintenance and operation permitted projection of its application for any scale of production.
2055233733	Abstract Conversion of thyroxine (T 4 ) to triiodothyronine (T 3 ), which was demonstrated in the 6000-g supernatant fraction of kidney homogenates prepared from Rana ridibunda frogs, was influenced by substrate (0.19–1.5 μ M ) and homogenate (39–625 mg kidney/ml) concentration and by temperature (19.5–36.5°) and duration (1 hr vs 2 hr) of incubation. Heating destroyed 5′-monodeiodinase activity. Addition of dithiothreitol (DTT) to the reaction mixture appeared to be essential to quantitate T 3 production, which even increased markedly in the copresence of ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA). Sensitivity of the DTT + EDTA-stimulated enzyme to propylthiouracil inhibition (25–45%) was discussed in relation with the ambient thiol concentration.
2055233742	The amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) has been applied to prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection of cystic fibrosis. The nucleotide sequence of both alleles of the PstI restriction fragment length polymorphism at the KM19 locus, which displays linkage disequilibrium with cystic fibrosis, has been determined. ARMS enables direct analysis of alleles of this polymorphism in DNA isolated from chorionic villus biopsy or white blood cells.
2055233753	The aim of this study was to characterise an oral bacterial isolate possessing extracellular bacteriolytic activity and to determine the basic properties of this activity. The lytic strain L1 was a gram-positive pleomorphic rod that grew only under anaerobic conditions. Glucose and raffinose were fermented whereas catalase and urease were not produced. The activity spectrum of a crude lytic fraction was restricted to strains of Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus . On the basis of its molecular weight (>30 kDa) as well as sensitivity to heat and trypsin, the factor(s) has a proteinaceous component. The activity was highly sensitive to EDTA suggesting that cations may be essential for optimal activity. Sulfhydryl groups are also of major importance in the lytic process as activity was highly stimulated by dithiothreitol and inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonic acid. Strain L1 was found to grow on a solid basal medium containing heat-killed A. naeslundii cells, and suggests a physiological role for the bacteriolytic activity. The bacteriolytic activity demonstrated in the present study may constitute a selective advantage for establishment of the bacteria in a complex ecosystem like the oral cavity. Keywords: bacteriolytic activity, enzyme, oral bacteria, oral ecology, Actinomyces .
2055233776	During embryonic development of homeothermic animals like birds and mammals transition from ectothermy to endothermy occurs especially in precocial species of both taxa. Based on some evolutionary aspects of the development of endothermy the review focuses on the prenatal development of endothermy and of the thermoregulatory system using the precocial bird as a model. During final incubation precocial bird embryos have all the prerequisites to respond to environmental (temperature) influences in a nearly appropriate way. Autonomic, neuronal and molecular mechanisms underlying the development of endothermy are established and the transition of the thermoregulatory system from a control system without feedback into a system with feedback mechanisms occurs. Precocial bird embryos are endothermic, but not homeothermic if incubation temperature decreases below the normal level, which seems to be associated with summit metabolism. At increased incubation temperatures the embryos are able to stabilize their body temperature. Therefore, above normal temperatures, homoeothermy can occur over a limited temperature range.
2055233838	The effects of microinjection of naloxone, an opiate receptor antagonist, into the medial preoptic area (MPO) and diagonal band of Broca (DBB) on luteinizinghormone (LH) and prolactin (PRL) secretion were examined in the intact male rat and female ratin diestrus 1. In both the male and female rats, the injection of 50 μg naloxone at 1300h produced an acute, two- to three-fold increase in serum LH, attaining the peak at 20min. The PRL concentration in the female 20 min-2h after the injection was significantly lower than in the saline-injected rat. In the male rat, naloxone caused a decrease in the PRL concentration in the late afternoon when a small rise occurred in the saline-injected rat, although it caused no immediate changes. In addition to these hypophysiotropic effects, naloxone injected in the MPO and DBB unexpectedly had seizurogenic actions. More than 40% of the animals of both sexes given an injection of naloxone had behavioral seizures, which began after about 20 min and were repeated intermittently at 15-20 min intervals through the sampling period of 6 h. In the LH and PRL response to naloxone, there was no significant difference between animals with and without seizure response in both sexes. The results suggest that in the preoptic opioid system there is no difference according to sex in the control of LH, and only a small one, if any, in the control of PRL. Further, on the basis of previous reports, there is a GABAergic system in the preoptic region, that is antagonized by naloxone and causes the activation of cortical neuronal activity.
2055233861	Translational control at the initiation step has been recognized as a major and important regulatory mechanism of gene expression. Eukaryotic initiation factor-3a (eIF3a), a putative subunit of the eIF3 complex, has recently been shown to have an important role in regulating the translation of a subset of mRNAs and is found to correlate with the prognosis of cancers. In this study, using nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cells as a model system, we tested the hypothesis that eIF3a negatively regulates the synthesis of nucleotide excision repair (NER) proteins, and, in turn, cellular response to treatments with DNA-damaging agents such as cisplatin (cis-dichlorodiammine platinum(II) (CDDP)). We found that a CDDP-sensitive sub-clone S16 isolated through limited dilution from an NPC cell line CNE-2 has increased eIF3a expression. Knocking down its expression in S16 cells increased cellular resistance to CDDP, NER activity and synthesis of the NER proteins XPA, XPC, RAD23B and RPA32. Altering eIF3a expression also changed the cellular response to CDDP and UV treatment in other NPC cell lines. Taken together, we conclude that eIF3a has an important role in the CDDP response and in NER activity of NPCs by suppressing the synthesis of NER proteins.
2055233873	Clinical, histopathological and ultrastructural findings of caprine dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB) with autosomal recessive inheritance are reported. The goats presented with exungulation, erosions, crusts and scars on the skin and ulcers in the oral cavity. Microscopically, the skin showed subepidermal separation with clefts filled occasionally with clear eosinophilic fluid, cellular debris or neutrophils. Ultrastructurally, the site of blister formation was the sublamina densa in the epidermal basement membrane zone. In skin with blister formation and in clinically uninvolved skin, the basal lamina was preserved, but the anchoring fibrils were sparse and rudimentary. A twin brother of an affected kid was mated over 5 years with his mother; three out of the 10 kids born presented with epidermolysis bullosa, indicating that the disease has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance. It is suggested that the disease is similar to human severe generalized recessive DEB.
2055233894	We examined the behavioural ecology of mothers and calves during the first year of life to identify variables predicting calf mortality among bottlenose dolphins. Specifically, we investigated whether the primary cause of calf mortality was poor calf condition or shark predation. Seventy-five per cent of calves that died (N = 12) showed visible signs of poor health compared with 4.7% of the survivors (N = 21). Calves that spent more time swimming in infant position (in contact under the mother) in the first year of life were more likely to die by 3 years of age than calves that spent less time swimming in infant position. No other behavioural or ecological measures tested were associated with calf mortality. We suggest that the mother and/or calf may compensate for poor calf health by increasing the time spent in contact with the mother. In contrast, frequent mother–calf separation and high rates of calf socializing and foraging are proposed to be indicators of vigour. Although most of our results do not support the predation hypothesis, mothers altered one behaviour in relation to predation risk. Mothers rested less in deep water during the warm months, where and when predation risk was high, than during the cool months, when predation risk was low, suggesting that predation risk influenced maternal vigilance. However, calf mortality was not higher in warm months than in cool months. Our results suggest that poor calf condition, not predation, is the primary cause of calf mortality.
2398621379	A single injection of the LRH agonist, Wy-40,972, under the right ovarian bursa (IB) on any individual day (D) 1-7 in the pregnant rat increased still further the compensatory ovarian weight gain produced by hemicastration (HC) alone. Conversely, a single subcutaneous (sc) injection during the same period abolished the compensatory hypertrophy and reduced the weight of the remaining ovary to that of the ovary of the intact rat and below. The single sc or IB injections of Wy-40,972 were most effective in delaying implantation when administered on D3-4 or 4, respectively. Subcutaneous administration on D5, 6, or 7 produced an antifertility effect, whereas IB administration on any of these 3 days failed to modify the pregnancy. These data demonstrate that the LRH agonist, Wy-40,972, acts directly on the ovary with regard to both weight increase and delay of blastocyst implantation. The results are discussed in relation to hormonal requirements for implantation and desensitization of the ovary.
2398621445	The roles of microorganisms in traditional alcoholic fermentation are often assumed based on abundance in the starter and activity in pure culture. There is a serious lack of hard evidence on the behavior and activity of individual microbial species during the actual fermentation process. In this study, microbial succession and metabolite changes during 7days of traditional Vietnamese alcoholic fermentation were monitored. Special attention was devoted to starch degradation. In total, 22 microbial species, including 6 species of filamentous fungi (Rhizopus microsporus, Rhizopus arrhizus, Mucor indicus, Mucor circinelloides, Cunninghamella elegans, Aspergillus niger), 1 yeast-like fungus (Saccharomycopsis fibuligera), 7 yeasts (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Clavispora lusitaniae, Wickerhamomyces anomalus, Lindnera fabianii, Pichia kudriavzevii, Candida rugosa, Candida tropicalis), and 8 bacteria (Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus helveticus, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus hominis, Bacillus megaterium, Enterobacter asburiae, Pediococcus pentosaceus) were identified. Despite the presence of a complex microbiota in the starter, the fermentation process is consistent and involves a limited number of functional species. Rapid change in microbial composition of fermentation mash was observed and it was correlated with ethanol content. Microbial biomass reached maximum during first 2days of solid state fermentation. Acidification of the medium took place in day 1, starch degradation in days 2, 3, 4, and alcohol accumulation from day 3. Although Sm. fibuligera dominated by cell count amongst potential starch degraders, zymography indicated that it did not produce amylase in the fermentation mash. In mixed culture with Rhizopus, amylase production by Sm. fibuligera is regulated by the moisture content of the substrate. Rhizopus was identified as the main starch degrader and S. cerevisiae as the main ethanol producer. Bacterial load was high but unstable in species composition and dominated by acid producers. M. indicus, Sm. fibuligera, W. anomalus and bacteria were regarded as satellite microorganisms. Their possible influence on organoleptic quality of fermentation product was discussed.
2398621475	Visual stimuli occurring naturally are rich in instances of objects delineated from the backgrounds only by differences in luminance, which is called first-order stimuli, as well as those defined by differences of contrast or texture, referred to as second-order stimuli. The neuronal mechanism for processing second-order stimuli is still unclear. In this study, we compared the responses of cat LGN (lateral geniculate nucleus) cells to second-order stimuli at five temporal frequencies to their responses to first-order stimuli. Our results showed that most LGN cells can be evoked by second-order stimuli, and their firing rates to second-order stimuli decreased relative to first-order stimuli as temporal frequency increased from 0.5 to 8 Hz; moreover the ratio of a nonlinear to linear factor had a higher value in the responses to second-order stimuli than to first-order stimuli. We also found that the responses of Y-cells to second-order stimuli were significantly higher than the responses of X-cells, suggesting the Y-cells have a more important role in the processing of second-order stimuli. All these results reveal that first-order and second-order signals might be processed in separate ‘streams’ of the visual system.
2398621598	Nerve growth factor, an important nutrition factor for neuronal survival, growth, development and maintenance of neuronal functions, consists of three kinds of subunit (alpha 2, beta and gamma 2), but only the subunit beta-NGF has the biological activity. beta-NGF coding sequence is located in a single exon of NGF gene. In our study, a pair of specific primers (29 mers) has been designed and synthesized with ABI 318 A DNA synthesizer. The upstream primer includes an initiation codon and the 1st to 20th base of the exon. The downstream primer includes the complementary sequence of 334 to 354 base of the exon and a stop codon. The full-length DNA fragment of beta-NGF gene has been successfully obtained from human brain cDNA library in lambda ZAPII/EcoRI and human brain genomic DNA respectively by using polymerase chain reaction. The reaction program consists of denaturing at 93 degrees C for 1 min, annealing at 55 degrees C for 1 min, and extending at 72 degrees C for 2 min. Both amplified products of 350 bp in length coincide with the exon coding sequence and are enough for the analysis of restriction mapping, DNA sequencing and construction of expression vector.
2398621787	In our approach to control reactive oxygen species produced as a result of oxidative stress experienced by cassava roots during harvesting, a phenomena which causes postharvest physiological deterioration in the roots, we transformed cassava variety TMS 60444 with the AtAOX1a gene, driven by the 35S promoter, using agrobacterium-mediated approach. Extracted genomic DNAs of putative transgenic lines were screened using polymerase chain reaction technique (PCR). Messenger RNA was extracted from selected PCR-positive lines for reverse transcription-PCR analysis for gene expression. To screen positive lines for gene function, leaf lobes from two transgenic lines with a line carrying an empty vector and the wild type were subjected to somatic embryogenesis (SE), a known oxidative stress process. The results show that the wild type, at 16 days after initiation (DAI) of the leaf lobes on callus initiation medium, had the highest (100%) number of leaf lobes that produced at least one observed organised embryogenic structure (OES). This was followed by PEV-3, the empty vector plant with 50% OES production, while PB-3 had the least percent (20%) of leaf lobes with OES. PB-3 line also had no OES at all in five out of the seven periods of data collection. During the period, the wild type recorded the highest attainable OES quality score of 2.0 (on a scale of 1-5 where 1=bad and 5=excellent) at the first initiation cycle. Both the transgenic lines and the empty-vector plantlet recorded quality score of 1.0. It seems AtAOX1a only hinders OES development, but exerts little effect on the quality, if OES does not degenerate after development.

2398621817	The fertility of male coypu sperm following seminal vesicle extirpation was investigated using the penetration test into the egg of Syrian golden hamster (Mesocricetus auratus). Ejaculates were obtained from five males by means of electro-ejaculation under halothane narcosis. The results of the zona-free hamster eggs (ZFHE) penetration test showed that the ejaculates of all the surgically treated coypu males were fertile and that ZFHE value fluctuated from 54 to 76.6%. The results obtained in experiments with natural mating revealed that the extirpation of male coypu seminal vesicles did not affect their fertility. In total 47 foetuses were found post mortem in ten coypu females covered by surgically treated males, which on average represented 4.7 foetuses per female.
2943189693	The progress in identification of genotypes with roots showing greater ability to penetrate compacted soils under moisture stress and understanding the physiological basis and morphological expression of the characteristics associated is fundamental to improving crop’s tolerance to drought and to increase productivity under individual and combined stress conditions. Our objectives were to: (i) determine genotypic differences in root penetration ability of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) using two methods (compacted soil layers and wax-petrolatum layers) to simulate soil compaction; and (ii) identify the morpho-physiological characteristics associated with the ability to penetrate compacted layers under well-watered and intermittent drought conditions in a greenhouse environment. Six common bean genotypes of different origin (Andean, Mesoamerican and interspecific) were tested in two trials. In the first trial, we evaluated genotypic differences in morpho-physiological characteristics that were associated with the root’s ability to penetrate compacted soil layers of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.6 g cm−3 bulk densities. In the second trial, we used another method to determine genotypic differences in root’s ability to penetrate wax-petrolatum layers of low, medium, and high mechanical impedance. The conditions for root growth were severely restricted by compaction and aggravated by drought stress. The medium level of mechanical impedance of wax petrolatum layer method showed the best results to evaluate bean genotypes for soil compaction tolerance. Among the six genotypes tested, ALB 91 (an interspecific line) was identified as the one with the greatest root penetration ability compared with A774 which showed the lowest root penetration ability under both well-watered and drought conditions.
2943189923	The number of annotated long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) continues to grow; however, their functional characterization in model organisms has been hampered by the lack of reliable genetic inactivation strategies. While partial or full deletions of lncRNA loci disrupt lncRNA expression, they do not permit the formal association of a phenotype with the encoded transcript. Here, we examined several alternative strategies for generating lncRNA null alleles in zebrafish and found that they often resulted in unpredicted changes to lncRNA expression. Removal of the transcription start sites (TSSs) of lncRNA genes resulted in hypomorphic mutants, due to the usage of either constitutive or tissue-specific alternative TSSs. Deletions of short, highly conserved lncRNA regions can also lead to overexpression of truncated transcripts. In contrast, knock-in of a polyadenylation signal enabled complete inactivation of malat1, the most abundant vertebrate lncRNA. In summary, lncRNA null alleles require extensive in vivo validation, and we propose insertion of transcription termination sequences as the most reliable approach to generate lncRNA-deficient zebrafish.
2943189966	Abstract In male goats, being in permanent visual contact with females in estrus does not prevent seasonal variation in certain endocrine hormone levels and sexual activities. In this study, we tested whether continuous and full contact with females in estrus prevented seasonal endocrinological variation in bucks. In 1 experiment (Exp. 1), we verified that the sudden introduction of goats in estrus increased the plasma concentrations of androgen in bucks during the nonbreeding season under our experimental conditions. In another experiment (Exp. 2), we tested the ability of estrous goats to prevent seasonal inhibition of LH and androgen secretions in bucks kept in permanent and full contact with them. In Exp. 1, 3 groups of bucks (n = 5 in each group) were isolated from females from the months of July to January. On January 27, one group continued being isolated from females; a second group was exposed to ovariectomized, untreated goats; and a third group was exposed to ovariectomized goats with induced estrus. Plasma androgen concentrations were determined every 2 h from 8 h before to 8 h after the introduction of females. The introduction of estrus-induced goats significantly increased androgen concentrations, which were higher than in the isolated bucks, as well as in those exposed to untreated goats (P 0.05). We conclude that full contact and sexual interactions with estrus-induced goats failed to stop the seasonality of LH and androgen plasma concentrations of bucks, although bucks could respond to the introduction of females by acute increases in plasma LH and androgen.
2943189981	Nucleoprotein (N) is a key element in rabies virus (RABV) replication. To further investigate the effect of N on RABV, we manipulated an infectious cDNA clone of the RABV HEP-Flury to rearrange the N gene from its wild-type position of 1 (N-P-M-G-L) to 2 (P-N-M-G-L), 3 (P-M-N-G-L), or 4 (P-M-G-N-L), using an approach that left the viral nucleotide sequence unaltered. Subsequently, viable viruses were recovered from each of the rearranged cDNA and examined for their gene expression levels, growth kinetics in cell culture, pathogenicity in suckling mice and protection in mice. The results showed that gene rearrangement decreased N mRNA transcription and vRNA replication. As a result, all viruses with rearranged genomes showed worse replication than that of rHEP-Flury in NA cells at a MOI of 0.01, but equivalent or slightly better replication levels at a MOI of 3. Consequently, the lethality in suckling mice infected with N4 was clearly attenuated compared with rHEP-Flury. However, the protection to mice was not enhanced. This study not only gives us insight into the understanding of the phenotype of RABV N gene rearrangement, but also helps with rabies vaccine candidate construction.
2943190009	"""The species Ixora coccinea L. is a shrub used to decorate gardens and parks. It is a plant that blooms all year round and because of its colorful colors, it is demanded all over the world. Most Ixora species are slow growing, so their propagation by cuttings using growth regulators and different substrates, can allow intensive exploitation. The objective of this work was to determine the rooting of three varieties of Ixora coccinea using three substrates and the growth regulators naphthalene-acetic acid (NAA) and indole-butyric acid (IBA). Axillary buds were collected from three varieties of Ixora that include pink, yellow and red colors. NAA and IBA were used at doses of 1, 1.5 and 2 mL kg1 and the substrates used were sand, burnt rice and forest soil. The axillary buds of each color were treated with the doses of the growth regulators and deposited in each substrate. They remained in the greenhouse for 60 days. At the end of the experiment, it was quantified; height (cm), maximum root length (cm), number of roots, percentage of survival and rooting and the data were analyzed by means of a Tukey test (P0.05). The results indicated that axillary buds of Ixora coccinea treated with NAA and IBA and, using any substrate as support, allowed reaching an optimal morphological development ensuring the survival and rooting of the plants in 100%."""
2943190074	Summary Giant pandas are unusual in belonging to a primarily carnivorous clade and yet being extremely specialized herbivores that feed almost exclusively on highly fibrous bamboo [ 1 ]. Paradoxically, they appear inconsistently adapted to their plant diet, bearing a mix of herbivore and carnivore traits. Herbivore traits include a skull, jaw musculature, and dentition that are adapted for fibrous diets and a specialized “pseudo-thumb” used for handling bamboo [ 2 , 3 ]. They have lost functional versions of the T1R1 gene codes for umami taste receptors, which are often associated with meat eating [ 3 ]. They also have an herbivore-like subcellular distribution of the metabolic enzyme alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase [ 4 ]. But meanwhile, giant pandas have a digestive tract [ 5 ], digestive enzymes [ 6 ], and a gut microbiota composition that resemble those of carnivores and not of herbivores [ 6 , 7 ]. We draw on recent developments in multi-dimensional niche theory [ 8 ] to examine this apparent paradox. We show that the pandas’ diet clustered in a macronutrient space among carnivores and was distinct from that of herbivores. The similarity with carnivore diets applied not only to the ingested diet but also to the absorbed diet, with the absorbed macronutrient ratios similar to those of the ingested foods. Comparison of the macronutrient composition of pandas’ milk with those of other species shows that the carnivore-like dietary macronutrient composition extends across the life cycle. These results cast new light on the seemingly incongruous constellation of dietary adaptations in pandas, suggesting that the transition from carnivorous and omnivorous ancestry to specialized herbivory might be less abrupt than it might otherwise appear.
2943190123	The invention discloses a tobacco CC-NBS-LRR resistance gene NtRRS3 gene and application thereof in resisting bacterial wilt by tobaccos, and belongs to the field of plant gene engineering. The NtRRS3 gene obtained through cloning from a bacterial wilt resisting variety Yanyan 97 of the tobaccos is supplied firstly, and a nucleotide sequence of the NtRRS3 gene is shown as SEQ ID No.1. According to the application, the NtRRS3 gene is transferred into the tobaccos to carry out functional verification. Shown by a result, an over-expressed NtRRS3 gene can remarkably improve the resistance of susceptible varieties to bacterial wilt. The separated NtRRS3 gene is an important gene for regulating and controlling the resistance of the tobaccos to the bacterial wilt, can be used to improve the resistance of the tobaccos to the bacterial wilt, and has an important application prospect in the aspects of molecular breeding for resisting bacterial wilt by the tobaccos and the like.
2943190216	A field experiment was conducted during Rabi season of 2012–13 and 2013–14 to study fodder yield, quality and nutrients uptake potential of different varieties of oats and barley. The trial consisted of fourteen treatments having eight notified varieties of oats, three notified varieties of barley and three combinations of mixed crop of oats variety (Kent) with different barley varieties. Single cut was taken when crop was at milking to dough stage for recording data. Overall, oats varieties produced more fodder yield compared to barley and mixed crop treatments. Among oats varieties, the highest mean green fodder yield (26.74 t ha−1) and mean dry matter yield (8.29 t ha−1) was recorded in oats variety JHO 822. Among barley varieties, RD 2715 recorded the highest mean green fodder yield (23.07 t ha−1) and crude protein yield (0.80 t ha−1). But the highest mean dry fodder yield (7.59 t ha−1) was observed in barley variety RD 2035. Among mixed crop treatments, Kent + RD 2552 recorded the highest mean green, dry and crude protein yield of 25.15, 7.54 and 0.73 t ha−1, respectively. Crude protein (10.5 to 10.8%) and dry matter (31.97 to 35.12%) contents were higher in barley varieties as compared to oats varieties (8.6 to 9.1% and 29.18 to 34.72%).
2055233956	In a similar manner to sequence database searching, it is also possible to compare three-dimensional protein structure. Such methods can be extremely useful because a structural similarity may represent a distant evolutionary relationship that is undetectable by sequence analysis. In this review, we summarise the most popular structure comparison methods, show how they can be used for database searching, and then describe some of the most advanced attempts to develop comprehensive protein structure classifications. With such data, it is possible to identify distant evolutionary relationships, provide libraries of unique folds for structure prediction, estimate the total number of folds that exist, and investigate the preference for certain types of structures over others.
2055233959	In heliothine moths, the male-specific olfactory system is activated by a few odor molecules, each of which is associated with an easily identifiable glomerulus in the primary olfactory center of the brain. This arrangement is linked to two well-defined behavioral responses, one ensuring attraction and mating behavior by carrying information about pheromones released by conspecific females and the other inhibition of attraction via signal information emitted from heterospecifics. The chance of comparing the characteristic properties of pheromone receptor proteins, male-specific sensory neurons and macroglomerular complex (MGC)-units in closely-related species is especially intriguing. Here, we review studies on the male-specific olfactory system of heliothine moths with particular emphasis on five closely related species, i.e., Heliothis virescens, Heliothis subflexa, Helicoverpa zea, Helicoverpa assulta and Helicoverpa armigera.
2055233960	Abstract Chitinase that appears as a single band by electrophoresis was purified from stable fly pupae. The chitinase has no cation requirements for activity, and a broad pH optimum around 5. The molecular weight of the chitinase, as determined by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, is 48,000, and the isoelectric point is 4.85. Kinetic properties were determined using acetylated chitosan. The K m is 33 m m and V is 1.21 μmol/min/mg protein. The insect growth regulator diflubenzuron had no effect on chitinase activity.
2055233981	Earthworm fibrinolytic enzyme component A (EFE-a) possesses an S1 pocket, which is typical for an elastase-like enzyme, but it can still hydrolyze varieties of substrates, and it exhibits wide substrate specificity. Former structure studies suggested that the four-residue insertion after Val(217) might endow EFE-a with this specificity. Based on the native crystal structure at a resolution of 2.3A, we improved the native crystal structure to 1.8A and determined its complex structure with the inhibitor Meo-Suc-Ala-Ala-Pro-Val-CMK at a resolution of 1.9A. The final structures show that: (1) EFE-a possesses multisubstrate-binding sites interacting with the substrates; (2) significant conformation adjustment takes place at two loops binding to the N-terminal of the substrates, which may enhance the interaction between the enzyme and the substrates. These characteristics make the substrate-specificity of EFE-a less dependent on the property of its S1-pocket and may endow the enzyme with the ability to hydrolyze chymotrypsin-specific substrates and even trypsin-specific substrates.
2055233991	During a survey of the freshwater aquatic and limno-terrestrial diatom flora of the Maritime Antarctic Region, six taxa belonging to the genus Muelleria that could not be identified were observed. Based on detailed LM and SEM observations, these six taxa have been described as new taxa: Muelleria desseiniana sp. nov., M. levkoviana sp. nov., M. nogae sp. nov., M. spauldingiana sp. nov., M. subsabbei sp. nov. and M. undulatoides sp. nov. Comments are made on their taxonomic position and how they can be distinguished from other species in this genus. Brief notes on the ecology and distribution of the six taxa are added. A compiled list of all Muelleria taxa described worldwide is included in this paper.
2055233999	We report on a neonate with a disorder of sex development, Prader 3-4 external genitalia and a palpable structure in the right inguinal canal suggestive of gonadal tissue. Chromosome studies on blood lymphocytes showed monosomy of chromosome X. Laparoscopy identified a streak-like gonad on the left side, unicorn uterus and a dysgenetic testis on the right, attached to a Fallopian tube. Because of the unilateral palpable gonad and the presence of ambiguous genitalia we investigated further for the presence of Y material. Quantitative fluorescent PCR analysis of material from the dysgenetic gonad and skin fibroblasts revealed the presence of chromosome Y-derived sequences, suggesting sex chromosome mosaicism. In 45,X/46,XY mosaicism, chromosome studies carried out on peripheral lymphocytes do not always reflect the proportion of cell lines in the gonads. The detection of Y chromosome material in a dysgenetic gonad is extremely significant, due to the high risk of malignant transformation.
2055234039	After lambing in late November, oestrus and ovulation were induced by using a CIDR device and PMSG in early weaned (N = 13) or lactating (N = 14) Border Leicester x Scottish Blackface ewes between 23 and 29 days after parturition. Ewes were intrauterine inseminated under laparoscopic visualization 54-55 h after CIDR-device withdrawal and eggs recovered on Day 3 of the cycle. Ovum recovery and fertilization rates were higher in lactating than in early weaned ewes, with fertilization being achieved as early as 24 days post partum in both groups. Of the 7 early weaned and 11 lactating ewes yielding eggs, fertilization occurred in 4 and 7 ewes respectively. A total of 20 embryos were transferred to the normal uterine environment of 15 recipient ewes in which the interval from parturition was greater than 150 days. Pregnancies were successfully established in 9 recipient ewes, resulting in the birth of 10 viable lambs. Prolactin concentrations were significantly higher (P less than 0.001) in lactating than in early weaned ewes throughout the study. Nevertheless, normal luteal function (as assessed by daily progesterone concentrations) was exhibited by 12 of 14 lactating and 8 of 13 early weaned ewes. Two post-partum donors in which the corpora lutea completely failed to secrete progesterone yielded fertilized eggs which developed to term when transferred to a normal uterine environment. The results show that sheep oocytes can be fertilized using laparoscopic intrauterine insemination as early as 24 days after parturition and that the resulting embryos are viable when recovered on Day 3 after oestrus and transferred to a normal uterine environment.
2055234065	Marijuana is a widely used drug that impairs memory through interaction between its psychoactive constituent, Δ-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ9-THC), and CB1 receptors (CB1Rs) in the hippocampus. CB1Rs are located on Schaffer collateral (Sc) axon terminals in the hippocampus, where they inhibit glutamate release onto CA1 pyramidal neurons. This action is shared by adenosine A1 receptors (A1Rs), which are also located on Sc terminals. Furthermore, A1Rs are tonically activated by endogenous adenosine (eADO), leading to suppressed glutamate release under basal conditions. Colocalization of A1Rs and CB1Rs, and their coupling to shared components of signal transduction, suggest that these receptors may interact. We examined the roles of A1Rs and eADO in regulating CB1R inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission in the rodent hippocampus. We found that A1R activation by basal or experimentally increased levels of eADO reduced or eliminated CB1R inhibition of glutamate release, and that blockade of A1Rs with caffeine or other antagonists reversed this effect. The CB1R–A1R interaction was observed with the agonists WIN55,212-2 and Δ9-THC and during endocannabinoid-mediated depolarization-induced suppression of excitation. A1R control of CB1Rs was stronger in the C57BL/6J mouse hippocampus, in which eADO levels were higher than in Sprague Dawley rats, and the eADO modulation of CB1R effects was absent in A1R knock-out mice. Since eADO levels and A1R activation are regulated by homeostatic, metabolic, and pathological factors, these data identify a mechanism in which CB1R function can be controlled by the brain adenosine system. Additionally, our data imply that caffeine may potentiate the effects of marijuana on hippocampal function.
2055234066	In this study, the karyotypes of ten species of aphids from Himachal Pradesh (Northwestern Himalayas), India, including new chromosome records for two species, have been reported. The chromosomes of other five aphid species collected from different host plants from this region were also re-investigated.
2055234081	To produce anticipated output of any crop, the site specific nutrients management (SSNM) is essential for balance and adequate nutrients supply without impairing the inherent fertility status of soil. For cowpea seed production and to maintain soil nutrient status, a field experiment was conducted with nine treatments (nutrients combinations) to find out appropriate SSNM practice. Nutrients especially N, P, K, S, Zn and Bo requirement for cowpea seed production was estimated to 30, 60, 50, 30, 15 and 2.0 kg per hectare respectively and treated as 100% of SSNM. Growth and development parameters were significantly influenced with the treatments. Maximum plant height (61.9 cm) was recorded when crop was fed with 125 per cent of SSNM. However minimum plant height (54.8 cm) was recorded in case of SSNM-N. Leaf Area Index (LAI) at 60 DAS ranged from 3.37 to 3.91. Nodules dry weight was significantly influenced by boron treatments apart from nitrogen and other as well. Maximum seed yield was obtained (2237.2 kg /ha) in the plot fertilized with 125 per cent of SSNM and minimum (1343.5 kg/ha) was recorded in the plot fertilized with state recommendation. Highest and lowest gross ( 40270/- and  24183/-) was recorded with 125 per cent of SSNM and with state recommendation respectively. Application of 125 per cent of SSNM recorded maximum uptake of nitrogen (205.3 kg / ha) which is at par with 100 % of SSNM. None of the treatment influences significantly soil fertility and physico-chemical properties of the soil rather slight improvement were recorded in all the observed parameters though considerable build-up of available P and exchangeable K was noticed in plots fertilized with SSNM.
2055234087	Observations were made on living neuroblasts (Nbs) of the grasshopper (Chortophaga viridifasciata) embryo during a 4-h recovery period following 1-h in vitro exposure to 10(-8), 10(-6), and 10(-4) M mitomycin C (MMC). None of these concentrations affected the duration of mid-mitosis (prometaphase, metaphase, anaphase), but one as low as 10(-8) M causes a small reduction in the rate at which Nbs move through the remainder of the cell cycle, primarily by retarding their progress through S. As the concentration is increased there is slower movement through S and also prophase (there are no true G1 and G2 periods in the rapidly dividing Nb: 4-h cell cycle at 38 degrees C). A significant proportion of the cells exposed to 10(-4) M are blocked for 1 or more h at very late prophase, i.e., just before nuclear membrane breakdown. In such retarded prophases the chromosomes resemble c-metaphase chromosomes even though the nuclear membrane remains intact. Mass spectrometry data revealed that one lot of the MMC used contained one or more impurities.
2055234117	Abstract Avian erythrocytes export cyclic AMP by a means that prostaglandins A 1 and A 2 , but not other eicosanoids, inhibit (EC 50 ≈ 45 nM). Several insect pheromones and the fatty acyl components of common membrane phospholipids also inhibit cyclic AMP efflux (EC 50 ≈ 3O μM). The presence of at least one double bond in the acyl chain enhances the effect. Unlike PGA, fatty acids probably do not act via formation of a glutathione adduct but very likely by altering membrane fluidity. Inhibition of cyclic AMP export provides a mechanism by which products of phospholipid metabolism can influence the cyclic AMP signaling pathway.
2055234202	"The large utilization of coccidiostats in dairy herds has raised the question regards the best product to use, based on better animal performance. Sixty-four Holstein calves were randomly assigned to four treatments at 10 (±4) d of age to evaluate calf performance when fed approved coccidiostats available on the market in Arizona, USA. Calves received a dry calf starter without (control) or with one of the following coccidiostats: lasalocid, 30 mg kg-1; decoquinate, 19 mg kg-1; and monensin, 30 mg kg-1. Calves received 3.6 kg d-1 of a commercial 22% CP:20% fat milk replacer until 6 wk of age. Calves were offered starter ""ad libitum"" up to 2 kg d-1, and calves had free access to water throughout the trial. Alfalfa hay was offered ""ad libitum"" after weaning. Performance and dry matter intake (DMI) were monitored for 20 weeks and broken down in different periods of measurement (0-6, 7-12 and 13-20 weeks, respectively). Despite the lower dry matter intake and weight gain for females on monensin treatment during the whole period, differences among coccidiostats were seldom observed under the conditions of this study. Good calf management and the dry, hot climate of Arizona perhaps diminished the chances for subclinical and chronic disease appearance which negated potential differences and differences in calf performances."
2055234231	Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex and enigmatic syndrome of unknown origin and etiology enclosing a broad spectrum of phenotypic manifestations. PCOS pathophysiology combines reproductive and metabolic abnormalities into a heterogeneous disorder that has pervasive and devastating health consequences. Inquiring the generative roots of the syndrome, it has become increasingly apparent the role of the environment as a determinant factor. Experimental exposure to industrial endocrine disruptors has been related with the impairment of normal reproductive function and metabolic regulation possibly favoring the development of or aggravating PCOS-resembling clinical disorders. Industrial chemicals may reflect the contributing role of an unfavorable environment to unveil PCOS characteristics in genetically predisposed individuals or further deteriorate the hormonal and fertility imbalances of PCOS-affected females.
2055234236	The Gram-positive bacterium Listeria monocytogenes is widely distributed in the environment and capable of causing food-borne infections in susceptible individuals. In this study, we investigated the cell envelope stress response in L. monocytogenes. Whole-genome transcriptional profiling was performed to investigate the response upon exposure to the cell wall antibiotic cefuroxime. Differential expression (at least twofold) of 558 genes was observed, corresponding to 20 % of the L. monocytogenes genome. The majority of genes that were strongly induced by cefuroxime exposure have cell-envelope-related functions, including the dlt operon and the gene encoding penicillin-binding protein PBPD2. A large overlap was observed between the cefuroxime stimulon and genes known to be induced in L. monocytogenes in blood and during intracellular infection, indicating that the cell envelope stress response is active at various stages of the infectious process. We analysed the roles of the two-component systems LisRK and CesRK in the cell envelope response, showing that activation of the most highly cefuroxime-induced genes was LisR- and CesR-dependent. In addition, multiple VirRS- and LiaSR-regulated genes were found to be induced in response to cefuroxime exposure. In total, 53 % of the genes upregulated at least fourfold by cefuroxime exposure are under positive control by one of the four two-component systems. Using genetic analyses, we showed that several genes of the cefuroxime stimulon contribute to the innate resistance of L. monocytogenes to cefuroxime and tolerance to other cell-envelope-perturbing conditions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate central roles for two-component systems in orchestrating the cell envelope stress response in L. monocytogenes.
2055234306	It is essential to develop a technique to culture purified skin-derived mast cells (SMCs) to facilitate immunological research on allergic diseases in dogs. This study was performed to develop an efficient culture system for canine SMCs and to characterize the cells in comparison to canine bone marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs). Enzymatically digested skin biopsy samples were cultivated in serum-free AIM-V medium supplemented with recombinant canine stem cell factor. Three to five weeks after the initiation of culture, mast cells were collected by a magnetic activated cell separation system using anti-c-Kit antibody. The collected cells were composed of a uniform population showing morphological characteristics of mast cells with a round or oval nucleus and abundant toluidine blue-positive metachromatic granules in the cytoplasm. The results of flow cytometric analysis for the presence of cell membrane c-Kit and Fc epsilon receptor I (FcepsilonRI) indicated that approximately 90% of the cells were mast cells. The cytoplasmic granules were positive for both tryptase and chymase. Apparent dose-dependent degranulation was induced by antibody-mediated cross-linking of immunoglobulin E (IgE) bound to the cells. These cytological and immunological characteristics observed in SMCs were mostly similar to those observed in BMMCs; however, IgE-mediated degranulation was significantly lower in SMCs than BMMCs. The culture system for canine SMCs developed in this study would be useful in understanding the pathophysiology and developing anti-allergic therapeutics in canine allergic dermatitis.
2055234308	This study aimed to evaluate the herbicidal activity of picloram on the biomass of the remediation plants Eleusine coracana and Panicum maximum after cultivation in a soil contaminated with this herbicide. These species were grown in three soils, differentiated based on texture (clayish, middle, and sandy, with 460, 250, and 40 g kg(-1) of the clay, respectively), previously contaminated with picloram (0, 80, and 160 g ha(-1)). After 90 days, the plants were harvested and an extract was produced by maceration of leaves and stems of these plants. It was applied to pots containing washed sand, comprising a bioassay in a growth chamber using soybean as a bioindicator for picloram. Soil and plant samples were analyzed by HPLC. The results showed the presence of picloram or metabolites with herbicidal activity in the shoots of E. coracana and P. maximum at phytotoxic levels with regard to soybean plants, indicating that they work only as phytoextractors and that the presence of straw on the soil surface can promote recontamination within the area. It is not recommended to cultivate species susceptible to picloram in areas where it was reported remediation by E. indica and P. maximum and still present residues of these species.
2398622257	Roffwarg et al. have proposed two complementary hypotheses to account for the finding that rapid eye movement (REM), or Active, Sleep occurs in large quantities in infancy and then drops off as the organism matures. The first assumes that the immature nervous system lacks inhibitory control and that the diminution of REM sleep reflects the maturation of the CNS. The second hypothesis postulates that REM sleep also serves a functional role, namely, to stimulate the central nervous system, thereby facilitating growth and maturation. A set of deductions, derived from the second hypothesis, was tested by analyzing the sleep-wake data of 22 normal infants. These were confirmed. The key findings were that the behavioral state of Quiet Alert correlated -0.82 with the state of Active Sleep and that this correlation was independent of maturational changes in the infants.

Cwp 1 is fused to the C-terminus of the scaffoldin protein and a secretion signal, such as Trichoderma reesei XYN2 is fused to the N-terminus of the chimeric scaffoldin protein. The scaffoldin protein is chimeric and comprises at least one C. cellulolyticum cohesin domain and at least one C. Thermocellum cohesin domain. The invention also includes a vector for expression of such a fusion protein.
2398622470	Influenza outbreaks by highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, such as H5N1, have caused significant morbidity and mortality in poultry and mammals. Though the risk of community-level spread of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) remains to be low since the transmission of influenza virus from animals to humans is not common, HPAI may acquire changes in receptor-binding specificity that lead to human to human transmission. Cases of sporadic infection in humans have been increasing every year and the continuous spread has posed a threat to animal and human health. Vaccination remains to be the most effective strategy to prevent and control the spread of influenza viruses. Other than conventional inactivated whole virus vaccine, several vaccine strategies have been adopted in order to universally defend against H5N1s infection, including subunit vaccine, viral v ector-based vaccine, chimeric epitope vaccine strains and HA stalk-based vaccine.

3149559868	A new and distinct cultivar of Symphoricarpos plant named ‘Kolmaswet’, characterized by its compact, upright and outwardly spreading plant habit; short stems and internodes, bushy and dense habit; freely flowering habit; numerous red purple-colored berries; and good garden performance.
3149559969	A 60-day feeding trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary chromium methionine (Cr-Met) supplementation on growth performance, digestive enzymes, hematological characteristics, and carbohydrate metabolic key enzyme activities in juvenile common carp (Cyprinus carpio). Seven diets (32.2% crude protein, 6% crude lipids of dry matter) were formulated to contain graded levels of Cr3+ (0.31, 0.43, 0.57, 0.73, 1.13, 1.90 and 3.64 mg/kg, respectively). Each diet was randomly assigned to triplicate groups of 60 juvenile common carp (approximately 40.95±4.80 g), which were stocked in plastic tanks. The results indicated that the highest weight gain (WG), specific growth rate (SGR), feed efficiency (FE), and protein efficiency ratio (PER), were observed in fish fed the diet containing 1.13 mg/kg Cr3+. There were no significant differences in the wholebody compositions; however the glycogen levels in the muscle and hepatopancreas in fish fed the basal diet were lower than those fed the other diets. The insulin (INS) and glycogen (GC) concentrations in the serum were not significantly influenced by the dietary Cr-Met levels. However, fish fed the basal diet had higher glucose and cortisol concentrations, and lower insulin receptor (ISR) and LDH concentrations in the serum than those fed diets supplemented with Cr-Met. Fish fed the 1.13 mg/kg Cr3+ diet had significantly higher hexokinase (HK), 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (6-PFK1), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH), glycogen synthase (GS), and lower phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) activities than those fed the basal diet. Based on the two-slope broken line model analysis between SGR and dietary Cr3+ levels, the optimal dietary Cr3+ supplement level was estimated to be 1.09 mg/kg for juvenile common carp.
3149560040	Using an F2 population including 200 individuals derived from a cross combination between two japonica rice DL115 with large grain and XL005 with small grain,which were significantly different on alkali digestion value (ADV),the quantitative trait loci for ADV were identified by composite interval mapping with SSR markers.The results showed that ADV exhibited a normal continuous distribution in F2 population,indicating that ADV is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple genes.A total of three QTLs conferring ADV were detected in intervals of RM14870-RM1284,RM3838-RM3351,and RM1812-RM332 on chromosomes 3,5,and 11,and explained 6.5%,10.3% and 8.1% of the observed phenotypic variance,respectively.The allele of qADV5 was derived from XL005 with less ADV,and the alleles of qADV3 and qADV11 were derived from DL115 with bigger ADV.The gene action was controlled by dominance and over-dominance.
2943190331	Bees play an important role in maintaining biodiversity by promoting the pollination of numerous plant species. Recent global climate changes are affecting the average air temperature, thereby altering the biological processes of many species. The objective of this study was to evaluate the adaptation of Apis mellifera L. bees to temperature increases and their responses to thermal homeostasis in the colony. Research was performed at the Federal University of Paraiba Laboratory of Bees using three treatments: Control, 33 °C and 40 °C. For the latter two treatments, colonies were kept in a 24 m² climate chamber with an opening at the hive entrance, giving the bees access to the outside environment. The following parameters were evaluated: difference between internal and external hive temperature, thorax surface temperature and total protein concentration in the hemolymph. Internal colony temperature varied according to the external hive temperature. Nurse bees that care for larvae exhibited higher heat production, expressed as thorax surface temperature. Total protein content in the hemolymph was highest in the 40 °C treatment and decreased with ambient temperature. External hive temperature influences internal hive temperature, and nurse bees have higher capacities for thermogenesis.

2943190450	"Camouflage is a method by which animals obtain concealment from other animals by blending in with their environment. Of the cephalopods, the octopods have an extra-ordinary ability to match their surroundings by changing the colour and texture of their skin. Skin patterns of the common octopus, O.vulgaris, are built up hierarchically from elements, units and components. Chronic patterns are longlasting, and are most commonly worn by Octopus; acute patterns last only seconds or minutes. Patterns are made up of components. Light and dark (chromatic) components can be distinguished, as well as components related to skin texture, or those related to posture and movement of arms, mantle, funnel, head and eyes. Components combined in series with like components and in parallel with unlike components, comprise whole patterns. At close range, Octopus skin is seen to be made up of units; patches surrounded by grooves. Papillae often arise from the centre of patches. each ""chromatic unit"" is made up of 3 types of elements. Most superficially lie differently coloured chromatophores; underneath these are two types of reflecting elements, reflecting cells and leucophores. Chromatophores can be expanded or retracted by their radial muscle fibres, which are under nervous control. The nervous control system is hierarchical: the paired anterior and posterior chromatophore lobes send nerves to innervate chromatophores of the head, arms and mantle. These lobes receive fibres form the paired lateral lobes which, in turn, receive fibres from the paired optic nerves, the ultimate controllers of chromatophores. Interestingly, O.vulgaris is found to be colour-blind. However, this animal is very capable of discerning differences in brightness, and this information is used to regulate the state of the chromatophores, thereby matching the tone of the surroundings. The reflector cells and leucophores (especially revealed in bright light when chromatophores are contracted) reflect incident wavelengths. The colour-blind Octopus is able to perfectly match its surroundings by actively forming a good intensity match using its chromatophores, thereby incidentally revealing a reflecting system that is able to match the background hues. Thus, if Octopus takes care of the luminance, the colour takes care of itself resulting in perfect camouflage."

2943190632	Propagule pressure is a leading determinant of population establishment. Yet, an experimental understanding of how propagule size and number (two principal parts of propagule pressure) determine establishment success remains incomplete. Theoretical studies suggest that the timing between introduction events, a component of propagule number, can influence establishment success. However, this dynamic has rarely been explored experimentally. Using Escherichia coli engineered with an Allee effect, we investigated how the timing of two introduction events influences establishment. For populations introduced below the Allee threshold, establishment occurred if the time between two introduction events was sufficiently short, with the length of time between events further reduced by reducing growth rate. Interestingly, we observed that as the density of bacteria introduced in one introduction event increased, the time between introduction events that allowed for establishment increased. Using a mathematical model, we provide support that the mechanism behind these trends is the ability of the first population to modify the environment, which can pave the way for establishment of the second population. Our results provide experimental evidence that the temporal distribution of introduction events regulates establishment, furthering our understanding of propagule pressure and may have implications in invasion biology and infectious disease.
2943190737	The poultry industry in Malaysia is fast growing but has become under threat due to inclusion bodies hepatitis (IBH) caused by strains of fowl adenovirus (FADV). The present study was carried out to propagate a field isolate of FAdV (UPM T27) and examine its pathogenicity in chicken egg embryo and chicken embryo liver cells. Five Specific Pathogen Free (SPF) chicken eggs were inoculated with 0.1mls of the FAdV UPMT27 isolate via chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) sac route. Supernatant from liver homogenate of dead embryo were used to infect freshly prepared chicken embryo liver (CEL) cells and observed for cytopathic effects for serial passages. Subsequently, passage 1 and 2 isolates were stained with H&E and observed under the microscope. Results show 100% mortality of the eggs at 11 days post inoculation and 100% CPE were observed at 4 dpi respectively. Eosinophilic inclusion bodies were also observed in the hepatocyte after H&E staining. These results confirmed that UPMT27 FAdV isolated from Malaysia are highly pathogenic and can be successfully propagated in CEL cells for future studies of the virus.
2943190817	The dynamics of nest-dwelling mites from the nests of the great tit in the protected area of Kamchia Mountain in Northeastern Bulgaria was investigated. The mite fauna inhabiting the nests of great tit differs significantly in terms of the degree of infestation, species richness, abundance and structure of communities in study years. There are statistically significant differences in the specimens’ number between 2014 and the other years 2012, 2013 and 2015. The mite species such as Dermanyssus gallinae, Androlaelaps casalis and Ornithonyssus sylviarum demonstrated significant changes in the abundance over the study years. A relation between the abundance of a species and the species diversity in the nests was not registered. Comparison of the annual dynamics of mites in the nests of great tit and the nests of semi-collared flycatcher for the same period of time and for the same environment, showed similarities—a significant fluctuation in the abundance of mites over the years and differences—in the species richness. Regarding the structure of the communities, both similarities and differences were recorded.
2943190854	Chrysoperla externa (Hagen 1861) is a generalist predator with a high degree of adaptability to different environments, which has allowed it to have a wide geographical distribution and to be considered as an alternative in biological control programs. This functional response study was performed to evaluate its predatory capacity on Melanaphis sacchari (Zehntner 1897), as prey. The L3 instar showed the highest prey consumption at each evaluated. The logistic regression analysis showed that the linear coefficient P1 of each larval instar was negative and significant (L1: P1 = - 0.1225 ± 0.0183, X2 = 44.8626, P = 0.0001*; L2: P1 = - 0.0747 ± 0.0265, X2 = 7.9182, P = 0.0049*; L3: P1 = - 1.1136 ± 0.6898, X2 = 2.6058, P = 0.01065*), which indicates that the consumption trend of each instar corresponds to a type II functional response. The highest attack coefficients (a) (0.00625 ± 0.000573) and the shortest handling times (Th) (1.0132 ± 0.0918) were observed in L3, meaning that this instar needs less time to identify, locate, capture and consume its prey. Based on these results, it can be inferred that C. externa can be considered as a natural enemy of M. sacchari.
2943190961	A malaria continua sendo um serio problema de saude publica amplamente distribuida nas regioes tropicais e subtropicais no mundo. No Brasil, a doenca ainda apresenta elevado numero de ocorrencias, no qual o Plasmodium vivax (P. vivax) e responsavel pela maioria dos casos. Uma das principais maneiras de controle desta enfermidade esta ligada ao seu diagnostico correto logo nos estagios iniciais, o que o metodo diagnostico por microscopia, ainda considerado “padrao ouro”, muitas vezes nao e capaz de proporcionar. Isso demonstra a necessidade de producao e distribuicao de testes de diagnostico que nao dependam de muitos equipamentos e profissionais qualificados, e que sejam capazes de fornecer resultados rapidos e acurados, mesmo em regioes remotas. Portanto, o presente trabalho promoveu o desenho de peptideos sinteticos contra regioes especificas da proteina Lactato Desidrogenase de Plasmodium (pLDH) e a imunizacao de camundongos para obtencao de anticorpos policlonais contra estes, dos quais apenas dois deles tiveram resposta de anticorpos especificos satisfatoria. O reconhecimento destes anticorpos a proteina nativa de LDH de Plasmodium vivax foram confirmados atraves de imunofluorescencia. Estudos futuros sao necessarios para confirmar a especificidade dos anticorpos, para serem avaliados com marcadores de infeccoes de malaria que possam compor um kit de diagnostico nacional de malaria.
2943191182	A Gram-stain-negative, aerobic, nitrogen-fixing bacterium, designated strain L461T, was isolated from leaves of Bryophyllum pinnatum growing at the South China Agricultural University. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated it as a member of the genus Azotobacterclosely related to Azotobacter beijerinckiiJCM 20725T (97.82 % similarity) and Azotobacter chroococcumATCC 9043T (97.34 %). Its major fatty acid components were C16 : 1 ω9c and C16 : 0. Its predominant isoprenoid quinone was Q-9. Its major polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, aminophospholipid, phospholipid and one unknown lipid. Its DNA G+C content was 64.9 mol% (Tm). DNA–DNA relatedness values between strain L461T and the reference strains of A. beijerinckiiand A. chroococcumwere 46.43 and 28.23 %, respectively. Biological and biochemical tests, protein patterns, genomic DNA fingerprinting, and comparison of cellular fatty acids distinguished strain L461T from the closely related Azotobacterspecies. Based on these data, the novel species Azotobacter bryophylli sp. nov. is proposed, with the type strain L461T (=KCTC 62195T=GDMCC 1.1250T).
2398622665	Studies were carried out on the occurrence of the Ixodic ticks in farm animals in the province of Camaguey, Cuba. Most spread proved to be the Boophilus microplus and Amblyomma cajennense species. As many as three waves of parasitic activity were seen with B. microplus: at the end of the winter season, in the months of May and June, and in the autumn (October and November). Only one wave was there with the activity of A. cajennense, covering the period of March-September.
2398622720	"In order to study the most abundant GABAA receptor subtypes expressed in cholinergic, dopaminergic, noradrenergic and serotonergic neurons (i.e., in neurons of the so-called ""global"" projection systems), we employed double-immunocytochemical techniques combining the labeling of GABAA receptor alpha1, alpha2 and alpha3 subunit with markers for these cells. Cholinergic neurons in the striatum, habenula, and pedunculo-pontine nucleus were immunonegative for the alpha1 subunit, and most were also alpha2-immunonegative. However, cholinergic neurons in the striatum, septum and pedunculo-pontine nucleus were alpha3 immunopositive. Dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta were highly immunopositive for the alpha3, and noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus were immunoreactive for the alpha3 and the alpha2-subunit; although neurons of these areas were negative for alpha1. Similarly, serotonergic neurons in raphe also showed a high level of labeling of alpha3, while there was a lack of immunoreactivity for the alpha1-subunit, and only some individual neurons were positive for the alpha2 subunit. As the presence of different alpha-subunits confers specific physiological and pharmacological properties to GABAA receptors, the abundance of receptors containing the alpha3 subunit (and the scarcity of receptor subtypes including the other alpha-subunits studied) may have important implications for the GABAergic regulation of brain ""global"" or ""diffuse"" projection systems."
2398622738	The epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) neutralizing enzyme soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) is a neuronal enzyme, which has been localized in both the cytosol and peroxisomes. The molecular basis for its dual localization remains unclear as sEH contains a functional peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS). Recently, a missense polymorphism was identified in human sEH (R287Q) that enhances its peroxisomal localization. This same polymorphism has also been shown to generate weaker sEH homo-dimers. Taken together, these observations suggest that dimerization may mask the sEH PTS and prevent peroxisome translocation. In the current study, we test the hypothesis that dimerization is a key regulator of sEH subcellular localization. Specifically, we altered the dimerization state of sEH by introducing substitutions in amino acids responsible for the dimer-stabilizing salt-bridge. Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) fusions of each of mutants were co-transfected into mouse primary cultured cortical neurons together with a PTS-linked red fluorescent protein to constitutively label peroxisomes. Labeled neurons were analyzed using confocal microscopy and co-localization of sEH with peroxisomes was quantified using Pearson’s correlation coefficient. We find that dimer-competent sEH constructs preferentially localize to the cytosol, whereas constructs with weakened or disrupted dimerization were preferentially targeted to peroxisomes. We conclude that the sEH dimerization status is a key regulator of its peroxisomal localization.
2398622816	Polycomb proteins such as the B lymphoma Mo-MLV insertion region 1 homolog (BMI1) are essential chromatin factors for the self-renewal and differentiation of embryonic and adult stem cells. BMI1 also plays a critical role in osteogenesis as Bmi1-deficient mice display a skeletal phenotype caused by the exhaustion of the mesenchymal stem cell pool. In this study, we have studied the role of BMI1 in the osteogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells (hASCs). BMI1 protein, but not RNA levels, increases during in vitro osteogenic differentiation of hASCs. Overexpression of BMI1 leads to an osteogenic priming of hASCs under nondifferentiating conditions and enhanced osteogenesis upon differentiation, along with increased BMP2 and WNT11 expressions. Conversely, knockdown of BMI1 expression reduces osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, our studies indicate that during osteogenic differentiation of hASCs, BMI1 is a downstream target of GSK3 signaling. BMI1, therefore, acts as a pro-osteogenic differentiation factor in hASCs and hence it is a promising target for active modulation of hASC-derived osteogenesis.
2398622913	Abstrcat Objective: To assess the efficacy of denaturing high-performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) as a new screening assayfor sequence variation in SNP detecting and new approach to SNP genotyping. Methods: DHPLC was used to screen SNPs in 8 DNA pools each consisting of DNA from 5 individuals,and genotype the identified SNPs in 150 Chinese subjects from Hong Kong. Results: Seventeen SNPs were identified:12 were novel and 5 were previously reported; 11 were found in screening stage and the other 6 were found in genotyping stage; 2 were only found in Caucasian samples; 3 showed ethnic difference of minor allele frequency(MAF); 7 were common with the MAF0.05 in Chinese samples. Conclusion: The results demonstrated the efficiency of DHPLC in screening SNPs when coupled with DNA pooling strategy,and in genotyping SNPs.
2398623215	This study was aimed at establishment whether preliminary determination of colonization factor antigens CFA may be useful in selection of potentially pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli with serological types belonging to ETEC and 750 isolates of E. coli from children with symptoms of diarrhoea. Enterotoxigenicity of strains was evaluated by suckling mice test and culture of Y1 cell tissue. Colonization factor antigens CFA were evaluated on the basis of slide agglutination and agar gel immunodiffusion with application diagnostic sera prepared for this study. Ability of enterotoxin production was found in 25% strains of E. coli with serological types belonging to ETEC. In 90% these strains were isolated from cases of epidemic diarrhoea. ETEC strains were found in 11% of hospitalized children and in 5% who were treated outside of hospital because of diarrhoea. MRHA adhesins occurred on 80% of ETEC strains were all diagnosed as CFA/I. CFA/II were not found and in only three strains non-fimbrial CFA/IV was present. Preliminary determination of CFA during selection of ETEC strains presents as a very sensitive method (97%) and is also highly specific (99%). Application of this method will result in significant increase of affectivity of biological tests directed toward determination of E. coli enterotoxigenicity.

2398623355	Loss of function mutations in the plant homeodomain factor 6 (PHF6) are responsible for the Borjeson–Forssman–Lehmann syndrome, a familial X-linked intellectual disability disorder, and are observed in approximately 20% of adult T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALLs) and 3% of adult acute myeloid leukemias (AMLs). However, mutations in B-cell lineage malignancies are notably absent. Interestingly, our recent work has uncovered PHF6 as a positive growth regulator in B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) through a genome-scale in vivo loss-of-function screen. To identify the molecular mechanism by which PHF6 acts to promote B-ALL growth in vivo, we utilized CRISPR-Cas9 to delete Phf6 in murine B-ALL cells. Transplantation of Phf6 knockout cells (Phf6KO) into immunocompetent syngeneic recipients significantly extends disease latency and survival, therefore validating PHF6 as a bona fide positive growth regulator of B-ALL in vivo. Strikingly, these mice develop lymphoma-like disease with complete penetrance, characterized by significantly enlarged lymph nodes, decreased disease burden in the spleen and increased expression of the canonical T-cell marker CD4, suggesting that Phf6KO B-ALL cells transdifferentiated to cells resembling those of the T-cell lineage. To dissect the mechanism by which PHF6 regulates this lineage decision, we carried out a combination of RNA sequencing and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analyses in Phf6WT and Phf6KO cells. RNA sequencing analysis revealed many differentially expressed genes in Phf6KO B-ALL cells , including gene sets involved in pathways important for B-cell development. ChIP-sequencing analysis of PHF6 and several histone marks (H3K27Ac, H3K27me3, H3K4me3) in Phf6WT B-ALL cells revealed that PHF6 and H3K27Ac signals co-localize close to the transcription start site of a significant proportion of differentially expressed genes. Transcription factor binding motif analysis revealed significant enrichment for several well-described master regulators of B-cell development, including PU.1, EGR-1, EBF-1, NF-κB and TCF3/TCF12. Notably, a number of these predicted transcription factors co-immunoprecipitated with PHF6 in Phf6WT B-ALL cells. These findings reveal an essential role for PHF6 in the maintenance of B-cell identity in B-ALL by activating, directly or indirectly, genes that are crucial for B-cell lineage commitment. Collectively, these results indicate that loss-of-function of PHF6 in B-ALL leads to transdifferentiation to the T-cell lineage, potentially explaining the apparent absence of PHF6 mutations in human B cell-lineage malignancies.

3149560608	Dear Editor,Akabane virus(AKAV),an orthobunyavirus,is transmitted primarily by biting midges and is widely distributed throughout the world except the Europe.AKAV was first isolated from mosquitoes in Japan(Oya et al.,1961).Although pregnant cows,ewes,and goats infected with AKAV exhibit no clinical signs of disease,in utero infections result in abortion,premature birth,stillbirth,and
2055234379	In vitro translation of liver mRNA from estrogen-treated Xenopus frogs yields two abundant polypeptides in the range of 20 kDa. DNA clones for one of these translation products were isolated and shown to be complementary to mRNA for the heavy subunit of ferritin. The predicted Xenopus amino acid sequence shares about 86% identity with the ferritin heavy chain from bullfrogs and about 70% identity with the comparable mammalian and avian proteins. Clone identity was confirmed by hybridization selection followed by in vitro translation into translation products of 19.5-20 kDa. The nearly full-length cDNA clone, termed XlferH1, comprises 868 nucleotides plus 22 adenosines of the poly(A) tail, including 134 nucleotides of the 5'-untranslated region, a 528-base coding region for 176 amino acids, and a 206-nucleotide 3'-untranslated region. The clone lacks 22 nucleotides from the 5' end of the mRNA. The level of ferritin mRNA in the liver of estrogen-treated frogs was determined over time. The amount of this mRNA relative to total RNA decreased about 3-fold 14 days after estradiol-17 beta was administered. However, the hormone also elevated total RNA in the liver about 24-fold. Hence, the total ferritin mRNA content of the liver increased to about 8 times its initial amount. This pattern of gene expression was very similar to that for serum retinol binding protein. The estrogen induction of these two mRNAs appeared to parallel the overall stimulation of hepatic RNA synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2055234420	Mycotoxins are toxic chemical compounds of low molecular weight produced by moulds. Throughout the years, the resistance of ruminants to mycotoxins has been assumed to be an almost absolute fact and the negative effects of these metabolites have been largely neglected by dairy farmers. However, such resistance should not be taken for granted as ruminants are fed various feed materials which might contain several different mycotoxins and in some cases, grazing animals might consume other mycotoxins via pasture. Metabolisation of mycotoxins in the rumen is not equivalent to complete detoxification. Moreover, its potential degradation is highly dependent on rumen microflora stability and pH, which vary according to feed composition and to the direct antimicrobial activity of mycotoxins. Young animals, high-yielding cows and animals in the transition period should be given particular attention as they are more susceptible to the negative effects of these toxic metabolites. A brief overview on the occurrence of these toxic compounds in commodities commonly used in dairy feeds will set the scene for a review of their impacts on rumen function and rumen health, reproduction, feed intake and performance, carry-over into milk, liver toxicity and foot health/lameness and other metabolic disorders.
2055234421	A rat mutant, whitish chalk-like teeth (wct), with white, chalk-like abnormal incisors, was discovered and morphologically and genetically characterized. The mutant rats showed tooth enamel defects that were similar to those of human amelogenesis imperfecta. The wct mutation was found to disturb the morphological transition of ameloblasts from secretory to maturation stages and to induce cyst formation. This mutation also disturbs the transfer of iron into the enamel, resulting in the whitish chalk-like incisors. A genetic linkage study indicated that the wct locus maps to a specific interval of rat chromosome 14 between D14Got13 and D14Wox2. Interestingly, the human chromosomal region orthologous to wct, a 5.5-Mb interval in human chromosome 4q21, is a critical region for the locus of human amelogenesis imperfecta AIH2. These results strongly suggest that this wct mutant is a useful model for the identification of genes responsible for amelogenesis imperfecta and molecular mechanisms of tooth development.
2055234448	As a result of a taxonomic study of the genus Mimosa L. for Flora de Nicaragua, Flora Mesoamericana, and Flora de M6xico, six new combinations at the infraspecific level, two new names at the specific level, and two changes of series category at the supraspecific level, are herein proposed. These taxa occur mainly in southeastern Mexico (states of Veracruz, Tabasco, Oaxaca, Chiapas, and the Yucatan Peninsula) as well as in Central America. RESUMEN. Como uno de los resultados del estudio taxon6mico del g6nero Mimosa L. para la Flora de Nicaragua, la Flora Mesoamericana y la Flora de MLxico, se proponen seis combinaciones nuevas a nivel infraespecffico, dos nombres nuevos a nivel especifico, asf como dos cambios en la categorfa de serie a nivel supraespeciffico, para los taxa existentes principalmente en el sureste de M6xico (estados de Veracruz, Tabasco, Oaxaca, Chiapas y la Peninsula de YucatAn) asf como en Centroam6rica. The genus Mimosa is characterized by biparipinnate leaves; haplostemonous or diplostemonous flowers, these disposed in capitate or spicate inflorescences; and articulate or unarticulate legumes with persistent margins. It comprises 480 to 500 species, of which 90% are American with the rest distributed in Africa and Asia. Most of the diversity is found in the tropics as well as in arid and semiarid regions at elevations from sea level up to 2250 m. Several species grow in temperate areas at 2000-2750 m (Grether, 1978; Lewis & Elias, 1981; Barneby, 1991). A taxonomic treatment of the genus for Flora Mesoamericana included 47 species with 28 varieties (Grether, 1997). In Nicaragua, 19 (40%) of these species have been found. Mexico is considered the second distributional center of the genus after Brazil: 100 to 110 species are known to occur in the country, and about 60% of them are endemic to different regions of it (Grether & Martfnez-Bernal, 1996). According to Barneby (1991), the genus in the New World comprises five sections: Mimadenia, Habbasia, Batocaulon, Calothamnos, and Mimosa; each of these includes series. Section Mimosa has been divided into three series, and series Mimosa into 37 subseries. The aim of this paper is to formalize and validate new combinations, new names, synonymies, and lectotypifications at the series, species, and variety level to accompany the taxonomic treatment of Mimosa in Flora de Nicaragua, Flora Mesoamericana, and Flora de Maxico. 1. Series Acantholobae Barneby Series Acantholobae is characterized by shrubby or arboreous species with lanceolate-oblong, oblong, or elliptic legumes, these 1-2.5 cm wide and with entire valves; the inflorescences are capitate or spicate. The group mainly occurs in Mexico and Central America, although Mimosa acantholoba (Humboldt & Bonpland ex Willdenow) Poiret var. acantholoba extends to Ecuador and Peru. Barneby (1991) considered series Acantholobae to comprise five varieties of M. acantholoba. Within this species, he accepted variation of inflorescences from globose to subglobose capitula or spikes and variation of legumes from lanceolate-oblong to oblong or elliptic, with valves glabrous, setose, or echinate. However, he described M. seticuspis as a distinct species. Within series Acantholobae, the following new combinations are proposed: Mimosa acantholoba (Humboldt & Bonpland ex Willdenow) Poiret var. seticuspis (Barneby) R. Grether, comb. et stat. nov. Basionym: Mimosa seticuspis Barneby, Mem. New York Bot. Gard. 65: 109. 1991. TYPE: El Salvador. Depto. Santa Ana: 15 km W of Metapan on low-lying ground N of Lago de Guija, 22 Feb. 1989, C. E. Hughes 1256 (holotype, NY; isotype, MEXU). In my opinion, this taxon should be treated at the infraspecific level because of its capitate inflorescences. The main difference with Mimosa acantholoba var. acantholoba is the narrower legume, NovoN 10: 29-37. 2000.

2055234453	Two forms of long-term depression (LTD), triggered by activation of NMDA receptors (NMDARs) and metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs), respectively, can be induced at CA1 synapses in the hippocampus. Compared with NMDAR-LTD, relatively little is known about mGluR-LTD. Here, we show that protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTP) inhibitors, orthovanadate and phenylarsine oxide, selectively block mGluR-LTD induced by application of the group I mGluR agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG-LTD), because NMDAR-LTD is unaffected by these inhibitors. Furthermore, DHPG-LTD measured using whole-cell recording is similarly blocked by either bath-applied or patch-loaded PTP inhibitors. These inhibitors also block the changes in paired-pulse facilitation and coefficient of variation that are associated with the expression of DHPG-LTD. DHPG treatment of hippocampal slices was associated with a decrease in the level of tyrosine phosphorylation of GluR2 AMPA receptor (AMPAR) subunits, an effect blocked by orthovanadate. Finally, in dissociated hippocampal neurons, orthovanadate blocked the ability of DHPG to reduce the number of AMPA receptor clusters on the surface of dendrites. Again, the effects of PTP blockade were selective, because NMDA-induced decreases in surface AMPAR clusters was unaffected by orthovanadate. Together, these data suggest that activation of postsynaptic PTP results in tyrosine dephosphorylation of AMPARs and their removal from the synapse.
2055234488	Although the RNase H-dependent mechanism of inhibition of gene expression by chemically modified antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) has been well characterized, little is known about the interactions between ASOs and intracellular proteins that may alter cellular localization and/or potency of ASOs. Here, we report the identification of 56 intracellular ASO-binding proteins using multi-step affinity selection approaches. Many of the tested proteins had no significant effect on ASO activity; however, some proteins, including La/SSB, NPM1, ANXA2, VARS and PC4, appeared to enhance ASO activities, likely through mechanisms related to subcellular distribution. VARS and ANXA2 co-localized with ASOs in endocytic organelles, and reduction in the level of VARS altered lysosome/ASO localization patterns, implying that these proteins may facilitate ASO release from the endocytic pathway. Depletion of La and NPM1 reduced nuclear ASO levels, suggesting potential roles in ASO nuclear accumulation. On the other hand, Ku70 and Ku80 proteins inhibited ASO activity, most likely by competition with RNase H1 for ASO/RNA duplex binding. Our results demonstrate that phosphorothioate-modified ASOs bind a set of cellular proteins that affect ASO activity via different mechanisms.
2055234532	Establishment and maintenance of stable muscle attachments is essential for coordinated body movement. Studies in Drosophila have pioneered a molecular understanding of the morphological events in the conserved process of muscle attachment formation, including myofiber migration, muscle–tendon signaling, and stable junctional adhesion between muscle cells and their corresponding target insertion sites. In both Drosophila and vertebrate models, integrin complexes play a key role in the biogenesis and stability of muscle attachments through the interactions of integrins with extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands. We show that Drosophila importin-7 (Dim7) is an upstream regulator of the conserved Elmo–Mbc→Rac signaling pathway in the formation of embryonic muscle attachment sites (MASs). Dim7 is encoded by the moleskin (msk) locus and was identified as an Elmo-interacting protein. Both Dim7 and Elmo localize to the ends of myofibers coincident with the timing of muscle–tendon attachment in late myogenesis. Phenotypic analysis of elmo mutants reveal muscle attachment defects similar to those previously described for integrin mutants. Furthermore, Elmo and Dim7 interact both biochemically and genetically in the developing musculature. The muscle detachment phenotype resulting from mutations in the msk locus can be rescued by components in the Elmo signaling pathway, including the Elmo–Mbc complex, an activated Elmo variant, or a constitutively active form of Rac. In larval muscles, the localization of Dim7 and activated Elmo to the sites of muscle attachment is attenuated upon RNAi knockdown of integrin heterodimer complex components. Our results show that integrins function as upstream signals to mediate Dim7–Elmo enrichment to the MASs.
2055234568	There is growing evidence that two, or possibly more, neurotransmitters can coexist within the same neurone. In particular, the presence of a peptide and a biogenic amine has been demonstrated in the same terminals of central and peripheral neurones. These findings have led to the hypothesis that neurotransmitters, coexisting within the same neurones, can interact at pre- or postsynaptic sites in a functionally coordinated manner. However, interactions between neurotransmitters contained in distinct neuronal systems terminating within the same region of the central nervous system (CNS) can be envisaged. We have examined this last possibility in the cerebral cortex, an area of the CNS where the two neurotransmitters vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and noradrenaline are contained in separate neuronal systems and where they both stimulate the formation of cyclic AMP. We report here that vasoactive intestinal polypeptide and noradrenaline act synergistically to stimulate the formation of cyclic AMP and that this synergistic interaction is antagonized by the specific alpha-adrenergic antagonist phentolamine.
2055234648	The complete genome sequence of the largest known double-stranded DNA virus, mimivirus, reveals the presence of a gene (denoted R355) that potentially encodes a cysteine protease that is expressed late (after 6 h) in the infectious cycle of the virus. In order to verify a sequence-based functional prediction and understand its role during the infectious process, the R355 protein was produced to assay its proteolytic activity and solve its three-dimensional structure. Here, the preliminary crystallographic analysis of the recombinant viral protein is reported. The crystals belonged to the orthorhombic space group P212121, with a monomer in the asymmetric unit. A MAD data set was used for preliminary phasing using the selenium signal from a selenomethionine-substituted protein crystal.
2055234670	Sea cucumbers, Apostichopus japonicus, experience seasonally high water temperatures during the summer months and enter aestivation to survive. Aestivation is characterized by strong metabolic rate depression which is supported by a series of strategies including reorganizing metabolic processes, suppressing cell functions, enhancing cytoprotective mechanisms, and altered gene expression. The respiratory tree tissue of the sea cucumber is an excellent material for studying aestivation, undergoing obvious atrophy during aestivation. The present study analyzed the global gene expression profile of respiratory tree tissue of A. japonicus during aestivation by constructing and screening three libraries representing key stages of aestivation: non-aestivation (NA), deep-aestivation (DA), and arousal from aestivation (AA) using RNA-seq. A total of 1240, 1184 and 303 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified following the criteria of |log2 ratio|≥1 and FDR≤0.001 in comparisons of DA vs. NA, AA vs. NA and DA vs. AA. A set of respiratory tree specific DEGs was identified the first time and, in addition, common DEGs that were responsive to aestivation in both respiratory tree and intestine were identified. Functional analysis of DEGs was further performed by GO enrichment analysis and respiratory tree specific GO terms were screened out and provide interesting hints for further studies of the molecular regulation of aestivation in A. japonicus.
2055234671	Volatile sulphur compounds (VSCs) are of prime importance in the overall aroma of cheese and make a significant contribution to their typical flavours. Thus, the control of VSCs formation offers considerable potential for industrial applications. Here, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) from different ecological origins were screened for their abilities to produce VSCs from L-methionine. From the data presented, VSC-forming abilities were shown to be strain-specific and were correlated with the C-S lyase enzymatic activities determined using different approaches. High VSCs formation were detected for those strains that were also shown to possess high thiol-producing abilities (determined either by agar plate or spectrophotometry assays). Moreover, differences in C-S lyase activities were shown to correspond with the enzymatic potential of the strains as determined by in situ gel visualization. Therefore, the assessment of the C-S lyase enzymatic potential, by means of either of these techniques, could be used as a valuable approach for the selection of LAB strains with high VSC-producing abilities thus, representing an effective way to enhance cheese sulphur aroma compounds synthesis. In this regard, this study highlights the flavour forming potential of the Streptococcus thermophilus STY-31, that therefore could be used as a starter culture in cheese manufacture. Furthermore, although C-S lyases are involved in both biosynthetic and catabolic pathways, an association between methionine and cysteine auxotrophy of the selected strains and their VSCs-producing abilities could not be found.
2055234674	Abstract 5-(Aziridin-1-yl)-2,4-dinitrobenzamide (CB 1954) is an anti-tumour prodrug which recently entered clinical trials in combination with Escherichia coli nitroreductase in a gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) context. A Phase I trial of the prodrug, however, revealed dose-limiting hepatotoxicity (transaminitis). The aim of this study was to find out whether the prodrug undergoes reductive metabolism in human liver to cytotoxic metabolites which may contribute to this clinical toxicity. CB 1954 (2.5–250 μM) was incubated with human liver preparations (2–8 mg/mL of S9, cytosolic or microsomal proteins) in the presence of NAD(P)H (1 mM). The NADH- and NADPH-dependent formation of both 2- and 4-nitroreduction products was demonstrated, with NADPH being the preferred cofactor, by HPLC and mass spectrometry. The major metabolite formed in all three human liver preparations was the 4-hydroxylamine, a potent DNA cross-linking cytotoxin. The 2-hydroxylamine and 2-amine metabolites were also detected, both of which have also been demonstrated to be highly cytotoxic. 2-Nitroreduction was far greater in S9 compared with cytosol and was not detected in microsomal preparations. Although 2- and 4-nitroreduction of CB 1954 was inhibited under hyperoxic conditions, substantial metabolism was observed under atmospheric oxygen levels. These studies demonstrate that human liver is capable of aerobic reductive bioactivation of CB 1954 to cytotoxic metabolites in vitro, possibly involving multiple enzymes, which may account for the clinical hepatotoxicity observed.

2055234698	The t(8;21) is perhaps the most frequent chromosomal translocation associated with acute myeloid leukemia. The translocation creates a fusion protein that consists of the DNA binding domain of the RUNX1 transcription factor fused to the MTG8 transcriptional co-repressor to create a potent transcriptional repressor. Here, we discuss the possibility that the t(8;21) fusion protein represses tumor suppressors that regulate the RAS signaling pathway and the p53 oncogenic checkpoint.
2943191265	Bradykinin (BK) is one of the kinin peptides and preferentially binds to bradykinin B2 receptor (BDKRB2). A recent study indicated that BK played an important role in the occurrence and progression of cancer. In this study, we evaluated the serum BK levels in 130 cervical cancer (CC) cases (including 65 cases with pre‑ and post‑surgery paired samples, another 65 cases with only pre‑surgery samples), 35 cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) cases (pre‑ and post‑surgery paired) and 35 control cases. We found that BK was overexpressed in patients with CC compared to patients with CIN and the control group. When combined with squamous cell carcinoma‑related antigen (SCCA), the diagnostic efficacy of BK was prominently enhanced. Moreover, we detected the expression level of the BK receptor BDKRB2 in CC, CIN and normal cervical tissues and observed a higher expression in the CC and CIN tissues than in the normal cervix. We then explored the possible mechanisms of action of BK in promoting the progression of CC. When BK was added to the cell culture medium, human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) angiogenesis increased and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in CC cell lines was also elevated. The BK antagonist, HOE140, exerted an opposite effect. The knockdown or the overexpression of BDKRB2 in CC cell lines further confirmed its oncogenic role in angiogenesis. Taken together, the findings of this study suggest that BK may be a diagnostic biomarker for CC and may notably improve the diagnostic efficacy when combined with SCCA. BK promotes the progression of CC by upregulating the expression of VEGF via BDKRB2 and subsequently facilitating angiogenesis.
2943191443	This thesis aimed to identify and parameterise the factors affecting host susceptibilityto parasitism.The model system chosen was the caecal nematode Heterakis gallinarum, infectingthe ring-necked pheasant Phasianus colchicus. It has become increasingly importantto examine the characteristics within hosts that affect susceptibility to parasitism ascurrent control methods are becoming more restricted. Non-invasive parasite controlprocedures for game birds could solve many of the problems associated with largescaleanthelmintic usage and resultant resistance.The research was undertaken using pheasants naive to parasite infection that wereorally challenged with H. gallinarum eggs, or using individuals previously exposed toparasitism that were again naturally exposed.The results showed that host susceptibility to parasitism was affected by variation inthe T-cell mediated immune response of the pheasant host, possible acquired immuneresistance of the pheasant to H. gallinarum parasitism, nutritional stress interactingwith body condition, and possible trade-offs between condition, spleenic response,secondary sexual ornaments and H. gallinarum parasitism. H. gallinarum did notseem to affect pheasant morbidity subsequent to parasite challenge.
2943191703	The field experiments on the population dynamics of the mustard sawfly Athalia lugens proxima (Klug) were conducted in the Instructional farm of Junagadh Agricultural University, Junagadh, Gujarat in two successive rabi seasons of 2012–13 and 2013–14. Correlation analysis of the pooled data revealed that the maximum and minimum temperature influenced the larval population negatively; while relative humidity in the morning and evening were positively (0.5363) and negatively (−0.1120) influencing, with their mean values exhibiting negative correlation. The estimate of determination coefficients (R2 = 0.7647) revealed that all the weather factors viz., temperature, relative humidity, sunshine hours, wind speed and rainfall had a major role on the population buildup.
2943191765	The evolution of sex determination mechanisms and sex chromosomes has always been a central research topic in evolutionary biology. Because the sex determination process occurs during the early stage of development, and the regulation of sex-linked genes often involves non-coding RNAs and epigenetic modifications, this topic is an interdisciplinary hotspot with developmental biology and molecular biology. This review elaborates on the importance and origin of sex, numerous ways of sex determination, and the mechanisms of sex chromosome evolution. We will summarize the reported sex-determining genes and introduce the population genetic models under which the sex chromosomes evolve without homologous recombination. To date, only a few sex-determining genes have been discovered, but they have already exhibited a great diversity beyond biologists’ expectation. Future research directions will focus on identifying more upstream sex-determining genes for plants and animals and their downstream sex-determining pathways. New genome research and gene knockout techniques will develop other appropriate model organisms in this area, and to ultimately address the basic biological questions that why different organisms need to evolve such a great variety of sex-determining ways and how they transit to each other.
2943191870	Flores is one of the four largest islands in the East Nusa Tenggara Province, of Indonesia. Flores still has forest areas with adequate biological diversity. However, empirical data about the biodiversity of plant resources is limited. The NKRI Expedition to Subregion 6 Ende was carried out to reveal the biodiversity of plant resources on Flores. In the expedition's inventory of plants observed, two species of the genus Amorphophallus belonging to the Araceae family were recorded. These are Amorphophallus muelleri Blume and Amorphophallus paeoniifolius (Dennst.) Nicolson.
2398623394	With substrate culture, this paper studied the effects of different concentrations of cinnamic acid on the physiological characteristics of Cucumis sativus seedling. The results showed that 25 micromol.L(-1) of cinnamic acid had an inhibition effect on carotenoids, but a promotion effect on chlorophyll a and b. 50 micromol.L(-1) of this compound could significantly inhibit the photosynthetic rate, transpiration rate and root activity (P < 0.05), and this effect was getting stronger when the concentration was higher. 150 micromol cinnamic acid.L(-1) had a significant inhibition effect on chlorophyll a and b (P < 0.05). Cinnamic acid had a weak inhibition effect on root activity when its concentration was low (25-50 micromol.L(-1)), but the effect was significant when the concentration was high (100-150 micromol.L(-1)), which became stronger with the longer handling time (P < 0.05).
2398623648	Blood cell indices and parameters of haemostasis were studied in the common marmoset. The majority of the results were similar to those found in man. Differences from man were that the prothrombin time was shorter in the marmoset, higher concentrations of aggregating stimuli were required to cause platelet aggregation, and marmoset platelets did not aggregate under the influence of adrenalin. There was sexual dimorphism evident in the data for fibrinogen concentration and for platelet count, both of which were higher in females than in males. Marmoset platelets were very similar in ultrastructure to those of man.
2055234794	Purpose To determine whether aqueous humor, the in vivo source of nutrients for trabecular meshwork cells, alters cellular and molecular characteristics in primary trabecular monolayer cell cultures when compared with standard culture conditions. Methods Human primary trabecular meshwork cell cultures were grown in DMEM supplemented with 50% human aqueous humor (DMEM-AH), heat-denatured DMEM-AH, 10% fetal bovine serum (DMEM-FBS, the standard culture supplement), or heat-denatured DMEM-FBS. Confluent trabecular cells were assayed for cell propagation and morphology for 21 days. Protein expression profiles of trabecular cell lysates were analyzed by two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Western blot analysis was used to determine the protein expression of myocilin and TIMP-1 in conditioned media collected from trabecular cells at 5, 10, 15, and 21 days. Myocilin expression was also analyzed by Western immunoblots after addition of dexamethasone (10(-7) M) or ascorbic acid (29 mg/dL). Results Trabecular cells supplemented with DMEM-AH for 21 days showed decreased cell proliferation when compared with DMEM-FBS (11% vs. 141%). Cellular morphology was also altered: Trabecular cells incubated in DMEM-AH showed larger-, broader-, and flatter-appearing cells than did the more spindle-shaped cells grown in DMEM-FBS. Protein profiles of trabecular cell lysates isolated from cells incubated in DMEM-AH differed from those incubated in DMEM-FBS. In DMEM-AH-conditioned medium, myocilin expression was increased and TIMP-1 expression was decreased at day 21. Induction of myocilin by dexamethasone was observed in conditioned medium isolated from cells treated with DMEM-FBS (442%), but only a 10% increase in myocilin was observed beyond the normal induction in DMEM-AH. Daily administration of ascorbic acid to DMEM-AH failed to increase myocilin expression beyond that obtained with DMEM-AH. Conclusions Addition of human aqueous humor rather than FBS to trabecular monolayer cell cultures triggers significant changes in cellular and molecular characteristics. The protein component of aqueous humor is responsible for these changes. Aqueous humor supplementation may maintain cultured trabecular cells in a more physiologic state.
2055234827	Abstract Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) has become endemic in the Thai swine industry, causing economic losses and repeated outbreaks since its first emergence in 2007. In the present study, 69 Thai PEDV isolates were obtained from 50 swine herds across Thailand during the period 2008–2012. Both partial and complete nucleotide sequences of the spike (S) glycoprotein and the nucleotide sequences of ORF3 genes were determined to investigate the genetic diversity and molecular epidemiology of Thai PEDV. Based on the analysis of the partial S glycoprotein genes, the Thai PEDV isolates were clustered into 2 groups related to Korean and Chinese field isolates. The results for the complete spike genes, however, demonstrated that both groups were grouped in the same cluster. Interestingly, both groups of Thai PEDV isolates had a 4-aa (GENQ) insertion between positions 55 and 56, a 1-aa insertion between positions 135 and 136, and a 2-aa deletion between positions 155 and 156, making them identical to the Korean KNU series and isolates responsible for outbreaks in China in recent years. In addition to the complete S sequences, the ORF3 gene analyses suggested that the isolates responsible for outbreaks in Thailand are not vaccine related. The results of this study suggest that the PEDV isolates responsible for outbreaks in Thailand since its emergence represent a variant of PEDV that was previously reported in China and Korea.
2055234851	Abstract The terminal regions of monomeric hook protein from Salmonella typhimurium are known to be highly mobile and exposed to the solvent. Although hook protein exhibits an unusual far UV circular dichroism spectrum, resembling that of random coil structures, our calorimetric experiments clearly demonstrate that the molecule has a compact ordered core. The compact part probably consists of three domains as suggested by deconvolution analysis of the calorimetric melting profiles. Secondary structure prediction, together with the analysis of fat-UV circular dichroism spectra, has shown that the domains of monomeric hook protein contain β-sheeted structures without significant α-helical content. The polymerization of hook protein is accompanied by the stabilization of its disordered terminal regions into a predominantly α-helical domain. Evaluation of circular dichroism data suggests that about 45 terminal residues are involved in helical segments. Coiled-coil prediction indicates that whereas the whole carboxy-terminal helical region of hook protein has a strong bundle-forming potential, there is only a single short amino-terminal segment exhibiting weak coiled-coil forming tendencies. The formation of α-helical bundles in commonly believed to be a key event during the polymerization of the axial structure of bacterial flagella. To clarify the role of helical bundle formation in hook assembly, proteolytic fragments of hook protein with truncations of various lengths in their carboxy-terminal disordered regions were generated, and their polymerizational behavior was investigated. We found that even fragments completely lacking the main helix-forming carboxy-terminal regions can polymerize into filaments in vitro under appropriately high salt concentrations. Our results suggest that, although helical bundle formation may occur during self-assembly, governing precise subunit packing and playing an important role in the stabilization of hook filaments, it is not the principal interaction mainly responsible for the development of their filamentous structure.
2055234922	Abstract The somatic cell nuclear transfer technique has been applied to various mammals to produce cloned animals; however, a standardized method is not applicable to all species. We aimed here to develop optimum procedures for somatic cell cloning in nonhuman primates, using common marmosets. First, we confirmed that parthenogenetic activation of in vitro matured oocytes was successfully induced by electrical stimulation (three cycles of 150 V/mm, 50 μsec × 2, 20 min intervals), and this condition was applied to the egg activation procedure in the subsequent experiments. Next, nuclear transfer to recipient enucleated oocytes was performed 1 h before, immediately after, or 1 h after egg activation treatment. The highest developmental rate was observed when nuclear transfer was performed 1 h before activation, but none of the cloned embryos developed beyond the eight-cell stage. To investigate the causes of the low developmental potential of cloned embryos, a study was performed to determine whether the p...
2055234927	We report on an unusual pathological finding of astrocytes, observed in the brain of a 16-year-old African-American male with severe intellectual disability and spastic quadriplegia. The brain showed bilateral pericentral, perisylvian polymicrogyria and pachygyria, in conjunction with a large number of hypertrophic astrocytes with eosinophilic granular cytoplasmic inclusions. The astrocytic abnormality was more severe in the dysgenetic area but present throughout the cerebral cortex. Astrocytic inclusions stained with acid fuchsin, azocarmine and Holzer's stain, and were immunoreactive for GFAP, S-100, and ubiquitin, but not for αB-crystallin, filamin, vimentin, nestin, tau or α-synuclein. Based on the case and a review of the literature, the authors postulate that these astrocytic inclusions in the cerebral cortex reflect abnormalities in radial glial developmental processes, such as migration, differentiation, or glial-neuronal interaction function during neuronal migration.
2055234935	Transmembrane-4 L-six family member-1 (TM4SF1) is a small plasma membrane glycoprotein that regulates cell motility and proliferation. TM4SF1 is an attractive cancer target because of its high expression in both tumor cells and on the vascular endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels. We generated mouse monoclonal antibodies against human TM4SF1 in order to evaluate their therapeutic potential; 13 of the antibodies we generated reacted with extracellular loop-2 (EL2), TM4SF1’s larger extracellular, lumen-facing domain. However, none of these antibodies reacted with mouse TM4SF1, likely because the EL2 of mouse TM4SF1 differs significantly from that of its human counterpart. Therefore, to test our antibodies in vivo, we employed an established model of engineered human vessels in which human endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFC) and human mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) are incorporated into Matrigel plugs that are implanted subcutaneously in immunodeficient nude mice. We modified the original protocol by (1) preculturing human ECFC on laminin, fibronectin, and collagen-coated plates, and (2) increasing the ECFC/MSC ratio. These modifications significantly increased the human vascular network in Matrigel implants. Two injections of one of our anti-TM4SF1 EL2 monoclonal antibodies, 8G4, effectively eliminated the human vascular component present in these plugs; they also abrogated human PC3 prostate cancer cells that were incorporated into the ECFC/MSC Matrigel mix. Together, these studies provide a mouse model for assessing tumor xenografts that are supplied by a human vascular network and demonstrate that anti-TM4SF1 antibodies such as 8G4 hold promise for cancer therapy.
2055234993	Although no species lives in isolation in nature, efforts to grow organisms for use in biotechnology have generally focused on a single-species approach, particularly where a product is required at high purity. In such scenarios, preventing the establishment of contaminants requires considerable effort that is economically justified. However, for some applications in biotechnology where the focus is on lower-margin biofuel production, axenic culture is not necessary, provided yields of the desired strain are unaffected by contaminants. In this article, we review what is known about interspecific interactions of natural algal communities, the dynamics of which are likely to parallel contamination in industrial systems. Furthermore, we discuss the opportunities to improve both yields and the stability of cultures by growing algae in multi-species consortia.
2055235027	The embryonic body pattern of Chironomus samoensis, as well as other chironomids, can be altered dramatically by irradiating their eggs with ultraviolet light (UV). Anterior UV irradiation leads to the formation of double abdomen embryos whose anterior segments are replaced by posterior segments with reversed polarity. Most double abdomens are symmetrical showing a mirror image duplication of the posterior six or seven segments. However, in some cases the anterior end of the double abdomen is shorter, and comprises fewer segments, than its posterior counterpart. These asymmetries range from moderate to extreme. They involve the juxtaposition, at the plane of polarity reversal, of disparate segments. The same range of symmetrical and asymmetrical double abdomens is also formed spontaneously in an apparently mutant strain of C. samoensis. There are striking similarities between this natural variant and the Drosophila melanogaster mutant bicaudal which are also discussed with respect to models of embryonic pattern formation.
2055235055	Summary In continuation of previous experiments in adult rats (6) the alteration in content and composition of lung phospholipids (PL) and lung structure of newborn rats of different gestational age was studied after three administrations of the amphiphilic drugs imipramine (75 mg/kg b.w.) and chloroquine (50 mg/kg b.w.). The fetuses were obtained by Cesarean section on day 20, 21, or 22 of gestation. Morphological examinations of the lungs of drug treated 21-day-old fetuses revealed a substantially better aeration than nontreated controls. 20 and 22 days old fetuses showed no differences in aeration between drug and saline treated rats. Analogous results were obtained with respect to the 1 h survival rate of newborns. Furthermore, imipramine and chloroquine cause a premature development of the pneumocytes type II as shown by electron microscopy. An increased PL content as well as disaturated phosphatidylcholine (DSPC) and phosphatidylglycerol (PG) proportion of fetal lungs, especially in animals born on day 21 of gestation, were found after drug treatment. The results suggest an acceleration of maturation of the pneumocytes type II in fetal lungs induced by amphiphilic drugs.
2055235064	The authors previously demonstrated that intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies (1-3 microm) in the mouse locus coeruleus under light and electron microscopy are characteristically stained using the Holmes modified method. We reported that one inclusion body existed in almost all neurons of the locus coeruleus. The present study examined whether similar inclusion bodies are present in the Syrian hamster (weight, about 60 g). Paraffin sections stained with the modified Holmes' method dis played numerous small inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of cells in the locus coeruleus. Epon sections (1 microm thick) stained using toluidine blue were observed under light microscopy, and numerous small inclusion bodies were again observed. Under electron microscopy observation, inclusion bodies (<1 microm in diameter) predominantly comprised small granular materials, similar to those described by previous investigators. Although inclusion bodies were devoid of a limiting membrane, the relation ship to cytoplasmic organelles was unclear. However, free and polyribosomes were occasionally noted in close proximity to inclusion bodies. Inclusion bodies may thus be formed from ribosomes. Intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in the hamster locus coeruleus differed in appearance compared with inclusion bodies in the mouse locus coeruleus.
2055235098	Papaver bracteatum, native to Iran and southern Russia, has been grown successfully in many countries. Research in the northwest United States has confirmed the potential for its commercial production as a source of the alkaloid thebaine. Potential for the chemical conversion of thebaine into codeine, one of man’s most widely used alkaloidal medicinal agents, is reviewed. Economic and social advantages of growing this species over opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) are discussed. The value of the seed oil for cooking and industrial use is considered.
2055235113	Abstract We have measured in vivo the uptake of 16α-[ 18 F]estradiol (FES) by target tissues in the immature rat at increasing dose levels (obtained by dilution of [ 18 F]FES with unlabeled estradiol). This was done to examine the binding capacity of target tissues in vivo and to determine whether the uptake in receptor-rich tissues was flow limited, as this has implications concerning the appropriateness of using receptor-rich tissues in experimental animals as models for FES uptake by receptor-poor breast tumors in humans. We also wanted to establish the dose level of the anti-estrogen tamoxifen required to block target tissue uptake of FES. We found that in untreated rats, specific uptake in the uterus saturated at c . 180 pmol/g, in the ovary at c . 54 pmol/g and in the muscle at c . 2 pmol/g. At an intermediate dose of tamoxifen (570 μg/kg), uptake saturated at somewhat lower levels, and at a high tamoxifen dose (1710 μg/kg), yet lower specific uptake was evident. In the FES titrations at low dose levels of FES, both the uterus and the ovaries, but not the muscle, showed characteristics of flow-limited uptake, i.e. the uptake-to-dose ratio reached a maximum level. This flow limitation suggests that only when receptor levels are sufficiently low will the FES uptake be related to receptor concentration. While receptor-rich tissues such as the rat uterus will show this flow limitation, the receptor concentration in most primary and metastatic human breast tumors is sufficiently low, so that the uptake should parallel receptor content. In in vivo distribution studies, target tissues (or tumors) with low receptor content will be more fully saturated and ligand more readily displaced. Also, uptake by secondary target tissues (i.e. those with a lower content of estrogen receptor, such as muscle, thymus and kidney) may be better models for assessing the effectiveness of new breast tumor imaging agents than uptake by receptor-rich tissues.
2055235136	Transgenic mice that allow mutant cells to be visualized in situ were used to study variation in tumors. These mice carry the G11 placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP) transgene, a mutant allele rendered incapable of producing its enzyme product by a frameshift caused by insertion of a tract of G:C base pairs in a coding region. Spontaneous deletion of one G:C base pair from this tract restores gene function, and cells with PLAP activity can be detected histochemically. To study tumors, the G11 PLAP transgene was introduced into the polyoma virus middle T antigen mammary tumor model. Tumors in these mice exhibited up to 300 times more PLAP+ cells than normal tissues. PLAP+ cells were located throughout each tumor. Many of the PLAP+ cells were singlets, but clusters also were common, with one cluster containing >30,000 cells. Comparison of these data to simulations produced by computer models suggested that multiple factors were involved in generating mutant cells in tumors. Although genetic instability appeared to have occurred in most tumors, large clusters were much more common than expected based on instability alone.
2055235179	Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a bone cell mitogen that affects osteoblastic function by suppressing type I collagen synthesis. The investigators in this study examined whether bFGF also regulates interstitial collagenase and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in osteoblast-enriched cells isolated from 22-day fetal rat calvariae. After exposure to 600 pM bFGF, interstitial collagenase messenger RNA (mRNA) levels, as determined by Northern hybridization analysis, increased after 2 h and were maximally stimulated to approximately 13-fold at 6 h. Exposure of osteoblast-enriched cells to 0.06-6 nM bFGF increased collagenase mRNA in a dose-dependent manner, and bFGF also increased immunoreactive collagenase measured in the culture medium by Western blot analysis. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide, as well as two inhibitors of protein kinase C, staurosporine and sangivamycin, prevented the bFGF induction of collagenase transcripts, whereas indomethacin, an inhibitor of prostag...
2055235191	The technique of extracellular space tracing with horseradish peroxidase is adapted for labeling the transverse tubular system (T system) in rat heart. In rat ventricular muscle the T system shows extensive branching and remarkable tortuosity. The T system can only be defined operationally, since it does not display specific morphological features throughout its entire structure. Owing to branching of the T system, a sizable proportion of the apposition between the T system and L system (or closed system) occurs at the level of longitudinal branches of the T system and is not restricted to the Z line region. The regions of apposition between the T system and L system are analyzed in rat ventricular muscle and skeletal muscle (diaphragm) and compared with the intercellular tight junctions (nexuses) of heart muscle by the use of a photometric method. The over-all thickness of the nexus is significantly smaller than that of T-L junctions in both cardiac and skeletal muscles. The thickness of the membranes of the T and L systems are not significantly different in the two muscles, but the gap between both membranes is larger in the heart. In atrial muscle the following two types of cells are found: (a) those cells with a well-developed T system in which the tubular diameter is quite uniform and the orientation predominantly longitudinal and, (b) cells with no T system, but with a well-developed L system. Atrial cells possessing a T system are richly provided with specific granules and show little micropinocytotic activity, whereas cells devoid of T system show intense micropinocytotic activity and few specific granules. The possible functional implications of these findings are discussed.
2055235209	The significance of melanotropic hormones as physiologic regulators of cutaneous pigmentation in humans is still controversial. Until recently, no direct effect for melanotropins could be demonstrated on human melanocytes. Here we present conclusive evidence that alpha-melanotropin (alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone, alpha-MSH) and the related hormone corticotropin (adrenocorticotropic hormone, ACTH) stimulate the proliferation and melanogenesis of human melanocytes maintained in culture in a growth medium lacking any AMP inducer. The minimal effective dose of either hormone is 0.1 nM. In time-course experiments, the increase in cell number and tyrosinase activity became evident after one treatment of the melanocytes with 100 nM alpha-MSH for 48 hr. The mitogenic effect gradually increased to 50-270% above control, depending on the individual melanocyte strain, with continuous treatment with 100 nM alpha-MSH for 8 days, whereas the melanogenic effect became maximal (70-450% increase above control) after 4 days of treatment. Western blot analysis of tyrosinase and the tyrosinase-related proteins TRP-1 and TRP-2 revealed that alpha-MSH increased the expression of those three melanogenic proteins. This was not accompanied by any change in their mRNA levels after brief (1.5-24 hr) or prolonged (6 days) treatment with 100 nM alpha-MSH, suggesting that the increased expression of these melanogenic proteins was due to posttranscriptional events. These results demonstrate both mitogenic and melanogenic effects of alpha-MSH and ACTH on human melanocytes. That both hormones are effective at subnanomolar concentrations, combined with the presence of melanotropin receptors on human melanocytes, strongly suggests that these melanotropins play a physiologic role in regulating human cutaneous pigmentation.
2055235218	Background:  The aim of the present work was to study the potential effect of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) of immunoglobulin superfamily on the invasion and metastasis of salivary adenoid cystic carcinoma (SACC).    Method:  The expressions of ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and NCAM of forty cases with SACC were examined by immunohistochemical methods using respective kits.    Results:  A significant relation showed between the expression level and histological differentiation, expression of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 in solid SACC was greatly increased compared with NCAM; SACC with metastatic lymph node or local recurrence displayed significant relationship to the up-regulation of ICAM-1 and VCAM-1, and to the down-regulation of NCAM.    Conclusions:  It is proposed that ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 may play a role in the invasion and metastasis of SACC. NCAM may be an invasion-resistant adhesion molecule.
2055235237	The levels of corticosterone were estimated by the HPLC method in the adrenal glands of stressed (5 h constant swimming) male albino mice treated with Trichopus zeylanicus, Withania somnifera and Panax ginseng preparations and compared with non-treated stressed and normal controls. The treatments increased the corticosterone levels in all the groups. The physical endurance (increased survival time) of swimming mice also increased in all the treated groups, except in the group treated with Withania somnifera powder (500 mg/kg, p.o.).
2055235251	Ernst Mayr’s influence on philosophy of biology has given the field a particular perspective on evolution, phylogeny and life in general. Using debates about the tree of life as a guide, I show how Mayrian evolutionary biology excludes numerous forms of life and many important evolutionary processes. Hybridization and lateral gene transfer are two of these processes, and they occur frequently, with important outcomes in all domains of life. Eukaryotes appear to have a more tree-like history because successful lateral events tend to occur among more closely related species, or at a lower frequency, than in prokaryotes, but this is a difference of degree rather than kind. Although the tree of life is especially problematic as a representation of the evolutionary history of prokaryotes, it can function more generally as an illustration of the limitations of a standard evolutionary perspective. Moreover, for philosophers, questions about the tree of life can be applied to the Mayrian inheritance in philosophy of biology. These questions make clear that the dichotomy of life Mayr suggested is based on too narrow a perspective. An alternative to this dichotomy is a multidimensional continuum in which different strategies of genetic exchange bestow greater adaptiveness and evolvability on prokaryotes and eukaryotes.
2055235267	Neuronal circuits underlying rhythmic behaviors (central pattern generators: CPGs) can generate rhythmic motor output without sensory input. However, sensory input is pivotal for generating behaviorally relevant CPG output. Here we discuss recent work in the decapod crustacean stomatogastric nervous system (STNS) identifying cellular and synaptic mechanisms whereby sensory inputs select particular motor outputs from CPG circuits. This includes several examples in which sensory neurons regulate the impact of descending projection neurons on CPG circuits. This level of analysis is possible in the STNS due to the relatively unique access to identified circuit, projection, and sensory neurons. These studies are also revealing additional degrees of freedom in sensorimotor integration that underlie the extensive flexibility intrinsic to rhythmic motor systems.
2943192547	Size variation of both males and females leads to taxonomic confusion regarding wholly parasitic euglossines. The six most widespread species, Exaerete frontalis, E. smaragdina, E. dentata, E. trochanterica, E. lepeletieri, and Aglae caerulea, ranged from 12.5 to 28 mm in length (n = 522; 50 females; 472 males), and within species, some were 40-80% larger than others. The size of E. lepeletieri matches E. smaragdina and E. dentata, but not E. frontalis, which it was said to resemble. Female E. lepeletieri, here described from Amazonian Ecuador, has a range shown to also include French Guiana and Suriname. Female Aglae and Exaerete were larger than males. Statistically, female Exaerete tended toward larger individuals more than did males. Each species should parasitize Eulaema and Eufriesea that have comparable size and provisions; thus multiple hosts may cause parasite size variation. Unknown factors may promote host resource partitioning between sympatric parasites, which include up to six in Yasuni Biosphere Reserve, Ecuador, the richest known euglossine community. Scutellum and metafemur punctation, sculpture and the frontal knob of both sexes, and male mesotibial tuft and metafemur permit easy identification of the six common species and E. azteca. Existence of E. kimseyae in Panama is questionable, while E. dentata there is certainly rare. The female tibial scoop, a structure in both Aglae and Exaerete, with a proposed function in material transport, is discussed. No new phylogenetic interpretation is presented.
2943192558	This survey was addressed to the task of studying agronomic performance of the sweet pepper crop Capsicum annuum, Cacique Variety. Four bio-stimulants were applied via foliar pump-pulverizing on the leaves of plants. The land parcel was located in the zone of Chaltura, Imbabura Province, 78° 21’ 66” W; 0° 33’ 33” N, at an elevation of 2,387 m.a.s.l. Main objectives included finding the bio-stimulant that best boosted the plant growth and yield, and identifying its proper dose, as well as its economical analysis. A Completely Randomized Block Design (CRBD) was used –with three replications, nine treatments, and a total of twenty seven experimental units.
2943192862	Switchgrass (Panicum virgatum) is a perennial warm-season grass that produces high biomass yield. Identification of mechanisms for genetic regulation of biomass traits has potential to facilitate genetic manipulation of switchgrass for enhancing biomass yield. The objective of this study was to identify quantitative trait loci for biomass-related traits in a pseudo-F2 population of switchgrass derived from an upland cross with a lowland switchgrass cultivar. Plant height (HT), crown diameter (CD), and plant biomass (PB) were assessed in field studies in 2015 and 2016. Plant height was positively correlated with PB in both years but only correlated with CD in 2016. Positive correlations between CD and PB were found in both years. Six quantitative trait loci (QTLs) were detected, including three QTLs on chromosome 2b for HT (2015) or CD (2016), two 2 QTLs on chromosome 2a for CD and PB in 2016, and one QTL on chromosome 5b for CD in 2016. The logarithm of the odds scores for these QTLs ranged from 4.9 to 8.2, and percentage variance explained ranged from 7.1 to 12.9%. One QTL on chromosome 2b appeared to simultaneously control HT in 2015 and CD in 2016. Homologs of candidate genes related to cell wall development and biosynthesis, hormone regulation, and metabolism were identified within the confidence interval of these QTLs. The findings from this study indicate that these QTLs can be important signals for genetic control of switchgrass growth.
2943193068	Survival of rare and endangered plant species following habitat loss and fragmentation is dependent upon in situ reproduction and population persistence, and establishment in new sites, so that stochastic, local extirpation does not lead to species extinction. Here we investigate if and how vegetative and sexual reproduction, propagule dispersal, and seedling establishment promote in situ persistence and establishment in new sites for the endangered, endemic Chilean tree Gomortega keule, in a landscape experiencing extensive habitat loss and fragmentation. Genetic analyses show G. keule reproduces vegetatively, producing large clone groups and providing a mechanism for long-term in situ persistence. Abundant seed set was observed, but seedling establishment was rare. At the single site where seedlings were observed, parentage analysis revealed seed dispersal over greater distances, and in a more aggregated pattern, than would be expected from gravity dispersal alone. We hypothesize that G. keule may represent a ‘seed dispersal anachronism’, wherein the native seed disperser has been lost and possibly replaced by domesticated cattle. The lack of seedling establishment at most sites raises concerns about the ability of existing populations to expand within existing habitat patches or establish at new locations. Globally, habitat loss and fragmentation, coupled with other environmental changes, pose a particular threat to rare species with small populations, because inbreeding and the loss of mutualists can lead to establishment failure and local extirpation. We propose that analysis of a plant’s reproductive strategies as a whole, in its landscape context, is essential for effective species conservation.
2943193081	Cancer develops as a result of the loss of self-control mechanisms by a cell; it gains the ability to induce angiogenesis, becomes immortal and resistant to cell death, stops responding to growth suppressor signals, and becomes capable of invasion and metastasis. Sphingolipids—a family of membrane lipids—are known to play important roles in the regulation of cell proliferation, the response to chemotherapeutic agents, and/or prevention of cancer. Despite the underlying functions of sphingolipids in cancer biology, their metabolism in different malignant tumors is poorly investigated. Some studies showed marked differences in ceramide content between the tumor and the respective healthy tissue. Interestingly, the level of this sphingolipid could be either low or elevated, suggesting that the alterations in ceramide metabolism in cancer tissue may depend on the biology of the tumor. These processes are indeed related to the type of cancer, its stage, and histology status. In this paper we present the unique roles of bioactive sphingolipid derivative in selected gynecologic malignant and nonmalignant lesions.
3139607555	Sequences of the internal transcribed spacer( ITS) was compared in three seabuckthrons( Hippophae rhamnoides subsp. sinensis,H. tibetana and H. neurocarpa) distributed in Qinghai Province,then the systematic positions of 15 seabuckthron samples were analyzed with Elaeagnaceae angustifolia being outgroup. The results showed that ITS sequences in three seabuckthron species varied in length from 600 to 605 bp. ITS-1,5. 8S and ITS-2 varied from 201 to 203 bp,166 to167 bp and 232 to 236 bp,respectively. The sequence divergence among three seabuckthorn species was also remarkably high. Cluster analysis based on ITS indicated that H. gonicocarpa subsp.litangensis and H. gonicocarpa subsp. goniocarpa were distinct and could be classified as H. gonicocarpa and H. litangensis. H. gyantsensis had the closest genetic relationship with H. salicifolia and the distant relationship with H. rhamnoides subsp. sinensis. The positions of nine subspecies of H. rhamnoides based on morphological classification were different from the results of ITS.
3149560874	Receptor for activated C kinase 1 (RACK1) is WD-40 type scaffold protein, conserved in all eukaryote organisms. Many reports implicated RACK1 in plant hormone signal transduction pathways including in auxin and diverse stress signaling pathways; however, the precise molecular mechanism of its role is not understood. Previously, a group of small compounds targeting the Arabidopsis RACK1A functional site-Tyr248 have been developed. Here, the three different small compounds are used to elucidate the role of RACK1A in auxin mediated lateral root development. Through monitoring the auxin response in the architecture of lateral roots and auxin reporter assays, a small molecule- SD29-12 was found to stabilize the auxin induced RACK1A Tyr248 phosphorylation, thereby stimulating auxin signaling and inducing lateral roots formation. In contrast, two other compounds, SD29 and SD29-14, inhibited auxin induced RACK1A Tyr248 phosphorylation resulting in the inhibition of auxin sensitivity and alternation in the lateral roots formation. Taken together, auxin induced RACK1A Tyr248 phosphorylation is found to be the critical regulatory mechanism for auxin-mediated lateral root development. This work leads to the molecular understanding of the role RACK1A plays in the auxin induced lateral root development signaling pathways. The auxin signal stimulating compound has the potential to be used as auxin-based root inducing bio-stimulant.
2055235342	Free amino acid concentrations have been measured in the tissues of a fetus at risk for argininosuccinic aciduria and of an obligate heterozygous fetus in a mother homozygous for homocystinuria. Argininosuccinic acid was detected in all tissues studied of the homozygous affected fetus from the heterozygous mother. Abnormal concentrations of methionine and cystathionine were observed in the tissues of the fetus who was an obligate heterozygote for homocystinuria. These abnormal free amino acid concentrations occur early in fetal development and may be related to later brain dysfunction.
2055235355	Integrins are transmembrane receptor proteins critical for growth and stabilization of vessels, but the mechanisms by which integrin activities are involved in neoangiogenesis of the eye remain unclear. Specific inhibitors to fibronectin receptor integrin alpha(5)beta(1) impeded pathological neovascularization in vivo. Our objective was to determine whether alpha(5)beta(1) plays a role in ocular angiogenesis, and whether a novel alpha(5)beta(1)-inhibiting small molecule is able to reduce angiogenesis in a model of inflammatory corneal neovascularization. Corneal neovascularization was induced in C57Bl/6 mice by NaOH-application and debridement of the limbal epithelium. Mice were randomized into six groups receiving either no treatment, or intraperitoneal osmotic pumps delivering three different doses of integrin antagonist or control substance on day 10 after scraping. In order to quantify the neovascular response, flatmounts were stained with FITC-CD31. Integrin alpha(5) expression was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantified by semiquantitative western blot analysis. Influence of integrin antagonist treatment on the mRNA expression of VEGF, bFGF and integrin alpha(5) was quantified by real-time RT-PCR. Vascularized corneas demonstrated a strong up-regulation of integrin alpha(5) within affected areas. Animals treated systemically with alpha(5)beta(1)-inhibiting small molecule showed a significant inhibition and regression of corneal neovascularization. PCR analysis evinced a significant up-regulation of VEGF and integrin alpha(5) mRNA levels in injured animals compared to controls, and a significant reduction of integrin alpha(5) mRNA in substance-treated animals compared to control substance, but no significant differences of bFGF levels in all groups. Western blot analysis of integrin alpha(5)beta(1) protein expression showed a trend towards up-regulation in injured animals, both control substance-treated and those treated with the alpha(5)beta(1)-inhibiting small molecule. Systemic delivery of an alpha(5)beta(1)-inhibiting small molecule inhibits and regresses corneal neovascularization induced by mechanical-alkali burn corneal injury. These results suggest an essential role for the integrin alpha(5)beta(1) in pathological neovascular processes of the cornea. Integrin alpha(5)beta(1) inhibitors could become a new approach for treatment of neovascularization in the eye.
2055235367	Molecular investigation of 110 clinical isolates of non-lipid-dependent Malassezia pachydermatis from dogs and cats was carried out by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and chitin synthase 2 (CHS2) gene sequence analyses. The RAPD analysis indicated that the clinical isolates of M. pachydermatis constituted four distinct genetic types (A, B, C and D). Moreover, the results from CHS2 gene analysis completely agreed with those from the RAPD analyses. The clinical isolates of M. pachydermatis were obtained from normal external ears, lesions of atopic dermatitis, flea allergic dermatitis, otitis externa, pyoderma and seborrheic dermatitidis in dogs and cats. Type A consisted of 93 clinical isolates as well as the ex-neotype strain of M. pachydermatis. The isolates of type A M. pachydermatis originated from lesions of all kinds of diseases. They were predominant on dog and cat skin. The other types, B, C, and D were isolated mainly from otitis externa.
2055235402	Rhodococcus sp. NCIMB 9784 is a camphor-degrading Gram-positive organism originally isolated from activated sewage sludge. A 5.4 kbp portion of a proposed camphor degradation gene cluster from this organism was cloned and its nucleotide sequence determined. Four open reading frames (ORFs) were identified encoding proteins possibly involved in camphor metabolism; sequence alignment of the translation products suggested that the ORFs encode for a ferredoxin reductase, acyl-CoA ligase, epimerase and an acyl-CoA dehydrogenase. The last three activities are thought to be involved in the poorly understood late stage of camphor degradation. Our findings are entirely consistent with the proposed formation of a branched 9-carbon acid intermediate (3,4,4-trimethyl-5-oxo-trans-2-hexenoic acid) which has been isolated from the fermentation broth of camphor-grown cells.
2055235406	Using the fluorescence histochemical technique, yellow autofluorescent granules were observed in neurones of the arcuate and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei of the rat (type I cells). In the same nuclei, neurones could be demonstrated showing a formaldehyde-induced yellow fluorescence (type II cells). Microelectrophoresis and special staining methods applied to the pineal gland revealed the autofluorescent compound to be a protein containing a relatively high content of tryptophan. It is probable that the formaldehyde-induced yellow fluorescence is due to the presence of serotonin. In view of investigating a possible functional relationship between the pineal gland and the parvocellular hypothalamic nuclei mentioned, hypothalamic type I and type II cells, as well as autofluorescent and serotonin-containing pinealocytes, if present, were quantified under the following experimental conditions: (1) p-chlorophenylalanine (pCPA) administration, (2) castration, (3) pinealectomy, and (4) pinealectomy followed by substitution using rat and sheep pineal extract. Administration of pCPA caused a decrease in the number of type II and an increase in the number of type I cells, both in the pineal gland and the hypothalamic nuclei. Castration, in contrast, was followed by an increase in the number of autofluorescent pinealocytes, but a decrease of autofluorescent neurones in the hypothalamic nuclei (type I cells) while the number of serotonin-containing pinealocytes increased; decreasing in both hypothalamic nuclei. After pinealectomy the hypothalamic nuclei showed an increase of type I neurones, but a decrease of type II nerve cells. Pinealectomy followed by substitution using pineal extracts restored the number of type I and type II neurones to that normally found in the arcuate and ventromedial hypothalamic nuclei of control animals. The present investigation brings histological evidence of an influence exerted by the rat pineal gland on nuclei forming part of the hypothalamic hypophyseotropic area. The data obtained and some of the literature strongly suggest that the type II neurones, which probably contain serotonin, inhibit, in the same hypothalamic nuclei, the production of luteinizing hormone-releasing factor (LH-RF). As yet, the function of the autofluorescent compound present in the type I neurones is not known.
2055235490	A morphometric study of Potentilla nivea, P unijlora, and P hookeriana, as well as the close relative of the latter, P furcata, has been carried out, and the quantitative data subjected to Canonical Discriminant Analysis. The four taxa belong to the arctic-alpine section Niveae of Potentilla, and material for the analysis was collected in Alaska, U. S. A. The a priori defined groups are based on petiole hair type, the qualitative, and only, character traditionally used to distinguish taxa within Potentilla sect. Niveae. The hair types recognized previously by taxonomists have been vaguely defined, and the intraspecific variation of other morphological characters has never been discussed. Ordination by canonical discriminant analysis was performed to characterize mean differences among species, to obtain insight into group differences, and to estimate character weights from correlations between canonical variates and original variables. The four taxa differ significantly in the canonical analysis of six quantitative characters. Leaflet length, incision depth (length of leaflet teeth), and ovule number are shown to be the most important discriminators. A key to the four taxa, taking into account the intra- vesus interspecific variation, as well as character weights, is provided.
2055235562	Summary  In a 6 × 6 Latin square arrangement, sheep of 41 kg body weight were fed myristic acid [C14:0; 50 g/kg dry matter (DM)] supplemented to two basal diets of forage : concentrate ratios of 1 : 1.5 and 1 : 0.5 and adjusted to dietary calcium (Ca) contents of either 4.2 or 9.0 g/kg DM (the latter only together with C14:0 supplementation). Various variables of energy, fatty acid and Ca metabolism were determined in combined digestibility and respiratory chamber measurements. With C14:0 addition the energy loss via the faeces increased (p < 0.05, post hoc test) without affecting energy digestibility of the complete diet. The apparent digestibility of supplemented C14:0 was higher (p < 0.01) with approximately 0.8 in the forage-based diet than in the concentrate-based diet (approximately 0.6). The elevated levels of plasma C14:0 were mainly accompanied by reduced C18:0 and C18:1 levels. The estimated apparent content of metabolizable energy (ME) of added C14:0 was either 24.5 MJ/kg (concentrate-based diet) or 32.1 MJ/kg (forage-based diet). Extra Ca equalized these differences between basal diets and ME contents amounted to 33.0 MJ/kg on average. As expected from corresponding slight shifts in energy metabolizability, the total efficiency of ME utilization increased (p < 0.1) with C14:0. The lower level of dietary Ca was still within the range recommended, but adding C14:0 to the concentrate-based diet reduced Ca retention in the body of the sheep from 0.9 to −0.1 g/day because of an impaired (p < 0.05, post hoc test) net Ca absorption, whereas no effect was found with the forage-based diet. With C14:0 addition, plasma total phosphorus (P) and serum calcitrol levels increased (p < 0.05, post hoc test) while Ca concentrations did not clearly reflect the reduced net Ca absorption. Increasing the dietary Ca content prevented adverse effects on Ca retention in the concentrate-based diet and improved Ca retention in the forage-based diet. In conclusion, the C14:0 supplementation reduced Ca availability in concentrate-based diets while an additional supply of Ca improved Ca and energy retention. Consequently, Ca supply should exceed recommended levels in diet types where dietary lipids are likely to reduce Ca availability and a compromise in basal diet type has to found to be able to profit best from the energetic value and the methane-suppressing properties of C14:0.
2055235579	Endothelin is a 21 amino acid peptide secreted by endothelial cells and is the most potent vasoconstrictor known. The present study examines regulatory mechanisms of endothelin secretion, focusing on the role of protein phosphorylation. Endothelin secretion was measured by radioimmunoassay in primary cultures of human umbilical vein endothelial cells. While treatment that raised cAMP levels reduced the basal endothelin secretion rate, agents that elevated cGMP had no effect. Downregulation or inhibition of protein kinase C resulted in decreased endothelin secretion, suggesting that protein kinase C regulates endothelin secretion in the opposite direction to cAMP dependent protein kinases Okadaic acid, at concentrations that selectively inhibit protein phosphatases 2A, reduced the endothelin secretion and the effects of okadaic acid and db-cAMP were additive. Endothelin production was stimulated by fetal calf serum and by the protein kinase inhibitor 1-(5-isoquinolinylsulphonyl)-2-methylpiperazine (H7), but was inhibited by the calmodulin antagonist trifluoperazine. The present findings that regulators of cAMP-dependent protein kinases, protein kinase C, calmodulin, and protein phosphatase 2A all affect endothelin secretion suggest that endothelin secretion is controlled by phosphorylation/dephosphorylation of as yet unidentified regulatory proteins within the cell. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
2055235598	In comparison to other complex disease traits, alcoholism and alcohol abuse are influenced by the combined effects of many genes that alter susceptibility, phenotypic expression and associated morbidity, respectively. Many genetic studies, in both animal models and humans, have identified genetic intervals containing genes that influence alcoholism or behavioral responses to ethanol. Concurrently, a growing number of microarray studies have identified gene expression differences related to ethanol drinking or other ethanol behaviors. However, concerns about the statistical power of these experiments, combined with the complexity of the underlying phenotypes, have greatly hampered the identification of candidate genes underlying ethanol behaviors. Meta-analysis approaches using recent compilations of large datasets of microarray, behavioral and genetic data promise improved statistical power for detecting the genes or gene networks affecting ethanol behaviors and other complex traits.
2055235625	Summary: Purpose: Correlations between granule cell dispersion (GCD), collateral mossy fiber (MF) sprouting, and hippocampal cell loss were studied to assess the relation between GCD and synaptic reorganization in the dentate gyrus of patients with epilepsy.    Methods: Twenty specimens from patients with medically intractable temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) were studied along with two control specimens. GCD was considered to be present when the stratum granulosum was wider than 120 μm, the close apposition between the granule cell (GC) soma was lost, and GCs were scattered in the molecular layer (ML). Patterns of MF sprouting were differentiated as wide or narrow according to the area of neo-Timm's staining in the ML. GC loss and volumetric cell-density decreases in the different subfields were assessed.    Results: MF sprouting was observed in 16 (80%) and GCD in nine (45%) cases. A significant correlation was found between MF sprouting and cell loss in all the subfields except the cornu Ammonis field 2 (CA2). A wide band of MF sprouting was associated with severe cell loss. Cases with GCD had a wide band of MF sprouting and also a higher degree of cell loss than cases without GCD.    Conclusion: GCD is associated with a specific pattern of MF sprouting, but cell loss was found to be a major determinant for MF reorganization.
2055235656	Different requirements for reproduction between sexes in dioecious plants can lead to gender-specific physiological responses to environmental constraints. Females generally endure higher reproductive investment and costs than males, displaying lower water and nutrient use efficiency and growth. We studied the ecophysiology of the dioecious shrub Corema album L. (D.) Don. to assess how drought impacts physiological responses and gender dimorphism along an aridity gradient within the species' range. Leaf gas exchange, photochemical efficiency (Fv/Fm), water potential (Ψ), vegetative growth (VG) and leaf C isotopic discrimination and nitrogen content were measured in three populations under markedly different climatic conditions. Physiological responses and growth indicated higher level of stress in the drier environments, leading to increased WUE (Δ) and lower VG. Physiological stress increases among plants were related to incremental changes in the degree of gender dimorphism, with significant effects on Ψ and Fv/Fm (P<0.05); males showed higher VG (P<0.001). Multivariate analysis of instantaneous and integrated measurements revealed gender-related effects across the climatic gradient (P<0.01). Reproduction investment has an effect on the physiological performance and growth of C. album. Gender responses are site-specific, being influenced by climate. The increase in physiological stress with aridity could lead to the potential retreat and variation in structure in these populations if genders are affected differently by the predicted climate change.
2055235685	miRNA gain- and loss-of-function can potently influence cellular behavior in normal physiologic states and in diseases such as cancer. The regulation of miRNA expression and activity by cellular signaling cascades can therefore result in dramatic phenotypic outputs. We previously demonstrated extensive control of miRNA expression by well-characterized oncogenic and tumor suppressor networks including the Myc, Kras, and p53 pathways. We are now employing novel mouse models with gain and loss of miRNA function to investigate the roles of the miRNAs embedded within these signaling pathways and the pathologic consequences when their functions are disrupted. Insights gained from these functional studies have led to the development of novel therapeutic strategies for cancer and other pathologic states based on miRNA delivery. I will present our latest findings related to miRNA regulation in cancer and exploitation of these findings for the development of novel therapeutic approaches.Citation Format: Joshua T. Mendell.

2055235688	An improved method for the detection of deoxythymidine kinase (TK) in human sera is reported. The method which utilizes 125I-iododeoxyuridine (IdUrd) as a substrate was used to measure TK in sera from patients with different diseases. Sera collected during the acute stage of infectious mononucleosis were found to contain elevated levels of TK, in most cases 10–40 times the normal value. The serum TK activity disappeared gradually and reached a normal level within 4 weeks. Sera from patients with other viral infections contained in most cases normal serum TK levels except in connection with measles, rubella, varicella, herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus infections. Additional studies revealed that sera from patients with different types of advanced lymphomas, acute leukemias, chronic granulocytic leukemia and lung cancer of the small-cell type with metastases, contained high TK level which fluctuated in parallel with alterations in activity of the disease. The TK activity in sera from patients with both mononucleosis and tumor disease was characterized by electrophoresis and by its ability to utilize cytidine triphosphate as the phosphate donor. The results showed that the serum TK has the same properties as the human cytosolar TK1, except in connection with varicella.
2055235738	We evaluated age-related changes in serum osteocalcin concentrations in non-periparturient cows and variations in serum osteocalcin concentration in periparturient primiparous and multiparous cows. The serum osteocalcin levels were evaluated in 144 non-periparturient Holstein dairy cows aged 11 days to 10 years; these levels were the highest in the youngest cows, appeared to steadily decrease with age until the time of the first calving, and were subsequently maintained at low levels. Between 14 days before calving and 21 days after calving, the serum osteocalcin levels were significantly higher in the primiparous cows than in the multiparous cows. A comparison between age-matched non-periparturient and periparturient cows showed that serum osteocalcin levels were significantly lowered during late gestation in both primiparous and multiparous cows. These results suggest that serum osteocalcin measurement might be useful for the detection of mineral imbalances at the time of parturition in cows.
2055235778	The transcription factor ecotropic viral integration site 1 (Evi1) is associated with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) in patients due to chromosomal aberration of chromosome 3. Here we show that Evi1 interacts with the histone methyltransferase SUV39H1. The interaction requires the N-terminal part of Evi1 and the H3-specific histone methyltransferase domain, SET, of SUV39H1 without Evi1 having an inhibitory effect on SUV39H1 methyltransferase activity. Presence of SUV39H1 enhances Evi1 transcriptional repression in a dose dependent manner. In addition, Evi1 also interacts with another histone methyltransferase, G9a, but not with SET9. Our data establish an epigenetic role of Evi1 in cell transformation by recruiting higher order chromatin remodeling complexes.
2055235808	A method is introduced to isolate and purify parietal cells from the rabbit stomach which has been briefly perfused with 1% glutaraldehyde via the celiac artery. The fixed mucosa is initially digested with 1% trypsin and subsequently with 1% collagenase solution. The parietal cells are more resistant to the effects of these proteolytic enzymes than the other cell types in the gastric mucosa and can be recovered and purified by centrifugation in a discontinuous sucrose gradient. Glutaraldehyde fixation reduces the tendency of cell clumping and, therefore, facilitates isolation of the separated cells. The final yield from each adult rabbit stomach varies from 0.1 to 0.4 ml packed parietal cells of about 97% purity determined by nuclear counts. The nuclei and mitochondria of most of the isolated cells appear to be intact on electron micrographs, but the cell membrane is focally disrupted; the nuclear deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) can be stained with Feulgen technique and extracted with perchloric acid for quan...
2055235810	Happiness and other emotions spread between people in direct contact, but it is unclear whether massive online social networks also contribute to this spread. Here, we elaborate a novel method for measuring the contagion of emotional expression. With data from millions of Facebook users, we show that rainfall directly influences the emotional content of their status messages, and it also affects the status messages of friends in other cities who are not experiencing rainfall. For every one person affected directly, rainfall alters the emotional expression of about one to two other people, suggesting that online social networks may magnify the intensity of global emotional synchrony.
2943193163	Glomerular disorders are a predominant cause of chronic kidney diseases and end-stage renal failure. Especially podocytes, epithelial cells which represent the outermost part of the filtration barrier, are affected by disease and experience a gradual loss of function. Despite recent advances in identifying potential pathways underlying podocyte injury, treatment remains challenging. It is therefore desirable to employ suitable model organisms in order to study glomerular disease and elucidate affected pathways. Due to its diverse ways of genetic manipulation and high genomic conservation, Drosophila melanogaster is a powerful model organism for biomedical research. The fly was recently used to assess podocytopathies by exploiting the nephrocyte system. Nephrocytes are spherical cells within the body cavity of the fly responsible for detoxification and clearance of unwanted substances. More importantly, they share many characteristics with mammalian podocytes. Here, we summarize how to use Drosophila as a model organism for podocyte research. We discuss examples of techniques that can be used to genetically manipulate nephrocytes and provide protocols for nephrocyte isolation and for morphological as well as functional analysis.
2943194157	The high cost as well as the uncertain availability of fish-meal have led to the need to identify alternative plant protein sources for feeding Oreochromis niloticus.  Moringa oleifera is a promising protein source for inclusion in fish diets.  The study was conducted to determine the suitability of heat-treated M. oleifera leaves as an alternative protein source for Oreochromis niloticus fry.   Four experimental diets were formulated to contain heat-treated moringa leaf-meal at levels of 5% and 10% of the total dietary protein.  Diet A contained 5% boiled moringa and 95% fry-meal: Diet B contained 10% boiled moringa and 90% fry meal : Diet C contained 5% steamed moringa and 95% fry-meal and Diet D contained 10% steamed moringa and 90% fry-meal.  Diet E was the control diet containing fish-meal as the protein source.  A standard 24-day fry feeding trial was carried out in 10 fry tanks that were randomly allocated to the five dietary treatments.  Each tank was stocked with 15 000 fry, the standard stocking  at Lake Harvest.  No feed-related mortality was observed during the whole experimental period.  The growth rate, feed conversion ration (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio of fry fed the five diets were similar.  The daily body weight gain ranged from 0.012 to 0.014 grams for fry fed boiled moringa and the control diets.  Fry fed diet C, D and E had higher FCR values of 1.1, 1.1 and 1.0 respectively, compared to those on diets A and B, which had values of 1.2 and 1.3 respectively.  In general, fry fed steamed moringa diets had better growth performance than those on boiled moringa diets although the differences were not significant.  The results suggest that steam-heated moringa leaf-meal can be used to substitute 10% of dietary protein in Nile tilapia fry without significant reduction in growth performance.
3139607846	A serial investigation and anaysis showed that the host leaves with higher concentration of nitrogen are much more resistible to the gall aphid than the lower. And the concntration of nitrogen of host tree^s leaves has a close relation to the soil. For these evidences, the concentration of nitrogen of host tree^s leaves can be regulated by selection the condition of soil and application of fertilizer. The susceptibility or resistance of host tree to gall aphid can be controlled to some extent. Consequently, it could be supposed that a new way to improve the yield of horn gall is actable by means of regulation the susceptibility or resistance of Rhus chinensis to Schlechtendalia chinensis.

3149561210	Abstract Objective Neutrophils are key effector cells of the innate immune system. They recognize antigens through membrane receptors, which are expressed during their maturation and activation. Neutrophils express FcγRII (CD32), FcγRIII (CD16), and FcγRI (CD64) after being activated by different factors such as cytokines and bacterial products. These receptors are involved with phagocytosis of IgG-opsonized microbes and enhance defense mechanisms. Based on that, our study seeks to compare the expression of FcγRII, FcγRIII, FcγRI, and CD11b on neutrophils from elderly and young subjects and their expression after in vitro activation with cytokines and LPS. Methodology Neutrophils were isolated from human peripheral blood and from mice bone marrow by density gradient. After isolation, FCγRs expression was immediately analyzed by flow cytometry or after in vitro stimulation. Results In freshly isolated cells, the percentage of FcγRIIIb+ and CD11b+ neutrophils were higher in samples from young individuals; FcγRIIIa expression was more prominent on aged neutrophils; FcγRIA expression was similar in all samples analyzed. Exposure to CXCL8 and LPS resulted in a higher percentage of FcγRIa+ neutrophils on elderly individuals’ samples but lower when compared with neutrophils from young donors. We observed that LPS caused an increase in FcγRIIa expression on aging human neutrophils. In contrast, FcγRIIIb expression in response to CXCL8 and LPS stimulation was not altered in the four groups. CD11b expression was lower in neutrophils from elderly individuals even in response to LPS and CXCL8. In mice, we observed differences only regarding CD11b expression, which was increased on aged neutrophils. LPS exposure caused an increase in all FcγRs. Conclusions Our results suggest that, in humans, the overall pattern of FcγR expression and integrin CD11b are altered during aging and immunosenescence might contribute to age-related infection.
2055235842	Summary To study the metabolic fate of dietary glucose in the lactating cow, uniformly C 14 -labeled glucose (G-U-C 14 ) was introduced through a fistula into the rumen. Continuous samples of respired CO 2 were collected and assayed for carbon-14; in addition, samples of rumen and duodenal contents, jugular and ruminal vein blood, and milk were collected at frequent intervals and assayed for Carbon-14. Following the administration of G-U-C 14 , the specific activity reached a maximum in respired CO 2 at 45min and in blood volatile fatty acids (VFA) at 15min, but the maximum was not reached in plasma glucose until 2 hr had elapsed. The first sample of rumen VFA, collected 1 hr after G-U-C 14 administration, had the highest specific activity and later samples decreased in specific activity by approximately one-half each 4–5 hr. Carbon-14 was not detected in rumen VFA after 24 hr. The specific activity of milk constituents after rumen administration of G-U-C 14 was different from that observed after intravenous injection of G-U-C 14 , but was similar to results obtained after intravenous injection of C 14 -labeled short-chain fatty acids. These results indicate that glucose was rapidly converted to short-chain fatty acids in the rumen before its absorption and utilization in the tissues of the cow for synthesis of milk components and oxidation to carbon dioxide. This study presents new information on the difference in metabolic fate of dietary glucose compared to intravenously administered glucose in the ruminant and shows the rapid transfer of carbon from dietary glucose to blood VFA, which had not been previously demonstrated.
2055235909	The human breast epithelial cell line HBL 100 synthesizes and secretes FGF2, is able to grow in soft agar but is not tumorigenic in nude mice. Transfection of this cell line with the FGF4 gene led to its tumorigenic conversion in a dose-dependent manner as assessed by growth under serum-free conditions, growth in soft agar and growth as xenografts in nude mice. Clones of FGF4-transfected cells producing different amounts of FGF4 secreted similar quantities of FGF2. Exagenously added recombinant FGF4 stimulated growth of clones that do not express this growth factor, but did not affect growth of FGF4-producers. Neutralizing IgGs directed against FGF2 strongly inhibited growth of clones that do not produce FGF4, but did not affect growth of FGF4-producers, indicating that the latter are FGF2-independent. Cross-linking experiments done with 125I-FGF2 showed a down-regulation of FGF receptors from the cell surface of FGF4-expressing clones. Taken together, these results indicate that the FGF signalling pathway may be involved during tumoral progression of human breast epithelial cells and that there is a dose-dependent relationship between the quantity of FGF4 produced and tumor development. © 1996 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
2055236069	Excessive exposure to visible light damages the vertebrate retina. New work demonstrates that two different pathways, a bright-light pathway and a low-light dependent pathway, mediate light-induced retinal death. Although both pathways are initiated by excessive activation of the photopigment rhodopsin, they differ in that only the bright-light pathway is AP-1-dependent and only the low-light pathway is dependent on phototransduction.
2055236103	The aim of present study was to elucidate the role of the interleukin (IL)-24 gene in predicting risk for plaque-type psoriasis and to describe the linkage disequilibrium (LD) pattern emerging from the genes of IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24. Genes encoding IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 locate in the region q32 of chromosome 1. The association between the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or haplotypes of the IL-24 gene and the susceptibility of psoriasis was not found. However, a significant protective effect of the combined haplotype CAAAC of IL-20 and IL-24 genes against plaque-type psoriasis was established (OR 0.154). Protective effect against psoriasis was also observed with haplotype TGGGT (OR 0.591) and haplotype CGAGT (OR 0.457). Performing a comprehensive analysis using the data regarding SNPs of IL-24 gene together with the previously published data regarding IL-19 and IL-20 SNPs, we identified two haplotype blocks within the region q32 of chromosome 1. The main result of the present study is that while the IL-19/IL-20 extended haplotype CACCGGAA is a significant susceptibility factor for psoriasis (previous study), IL-20/IL-24 haplotypes CAAAC, TGGGT and CGAGT have a significant protective effect. Nevertheless, family-based studies are required to confirm the impact of IL-19, IL-20 and IL-24 genes in the genetic predisposition for psoriasis.

2055236124	The thesis advanced in this essay is that stem cells-particularly those in the nervous system-are components in a series of inborn 'programs' that not only ensure normal development, but persist throughout life so as to maintain homeostasis in the face of perturbations-both small and great. These programs encode what has come to be called 'plasticity'. The stem cell is one of the repositories of this plasticity. This review examines the evidence that interaction between the neural stem cell (as a prototypical somatic stem cell) and the developing or injured brain is a dynamic, complex, ongoing reciprocal set of interactions where both entities are constantly in flux. We suggest that this interaction can be viewed almost from a 'systems biology' vantage point. We further advance the notion that clones of exogenous stem cells in transplantation paradigms may not only be viewed for their therapeutic potential, but also as biological tools for 'interrogating' the normal or abnormal central nervous system environment, indicating what salient cues (among the many present) are actually guiding the expression of these 'programs'; in other words, using the stem cell as a 'reporter cell'. Based on this type of analysis, we suggest some of the relevant molecular pathways responsible for this 'cross-talk' which, in turn, lead to proliferation, migration, cell genesis, trophic support, protection, guidance, detoxification, rescue, etc. This type of developmental insight, we propose, is required for the development of therapeutic strategies for neurodegenerative disease and other nervous system afflictions in humans. Understanding the relevant molecular pathways of stem cell repair phenotype should be a priority, in our view, for the entire stem cell field.
2055236151	Abstract The reliability of the determination of antibody avidity in polyclonal sera by indirect sandwich ELISA was studied. Binding of IgM and IgG (sub)classes in unpurified serum to Streptococcus pneumoniae type 3 capsular polysaccharide, which was coated onto ELISA plates, was inhibited with different inhibitors. The inhibitor concn at which 50% inhibition of antibody binding to the ELISA coat was achieved, was used as a measure for antibody avidity. As this 50% inhibition value is dependent upon the dilution of the serum and thus upon the initial amount of free antibody, it is necessary to define (a narrow range of) final ELISA absorbance values to which the dilutions of non-inhibited sera have to be adjusted. The shapes of the serum dilution curves have a good correlation with the numerical 50% inhibition values of the antibody avidity. The inhibition ELISA is suitable to compare the avidity values of the different antibody isotypes, but two remarks should be made: (1) antibody heterogeneity should be considered to influence the results and prevent the accurate measurement of absolute numerical avidity values. Because in the ELISA system merely antibody “activity” is measured, comparison of the efficacy of vaccines by means of the 50% inhibition (avidity) value of various antibody (sub)classes can still be performed in a reliable way; (2) results of the determination of the 50% inhibition values of the different antibody (sub)classes showed them to be dependent on the molecular ratio between antibody (sub)class levels. More aspects of the determination should be taken into account, like shapes of simple dilution curves, influences of various inhibitor concns in the diluent and whole (extended) inhibition curves.
2055236237	We examined i) the kinds of connexins, component proteins of gap junctions, that are expressed in osteoblasts and ii) the relationship between the expression of gap junctions and osteoblastic phenotype during cell proliferation and after the treatment with 1α, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3. Human osteoblastic cells with (SV-HFO) or without (HFO) transformation by simian virus 40 and mouse osteoblast-like cells (MC3T3-E1) expressed connexin 43 (Cx43), but not Cx26 or Cx32, as revealed by Northern blot analysis and immunocytochemistry. The expression of Cx43 was significantly higher in SV-HFO cells in the confluent phase than in the proliferative phase. Similarly, the expression of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin in SV-HFO cells in the confluent phase were higher than those in the proliferative phase. On the other hand, treatment of lα, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 did not change the expression of Cx43 in SV-HFO cells, but significantly induced the expression of ALP and osteocalcin. These results showed that the expression of gap junction protein in osteoblastic cells was coupled with cell differentiation in association with the expression of osteoblastic phenotype, but that the connexin expression is regulated in a way different from that of ALP and osteocalcin.
2055236262	The specimens of the Krantz Brachiopod Collection of the Science Museum of the University of Coimbra (Portugal) are revised according to modern taxonomy and presented in systematic order according to inventory number, type species, figured representative and, as far as possible, detailed information regarding stratigraphy and collecting localities. The collection itself contains 170 lots yielding 474 specimens and representing 15 of the 27 brachiopod orders. The material comes from Europe, Russia, and the United States and represents all Palaeozoic and Mesozoic periods; the majority of the brachiopods are from the Devonian of Germany, mostly collected in classical outcrops from the Rhenish Slate Mountains, many of which are no longer accessible.
2055236272	Regulation of the actin cytoskeleton by microtubules is mediated by the Rho family GTPases. However, the molecular mechanisms that link microtubule dynamics to Rho GTPases have not, as yet, been identified. Here we show that the Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF)-H1 is regulated by an interaction with microtubules. GEF-H1 mutants that are deficient in microtubule binding have higher activity levels than microtubule-bound forms. These mutants also induce Rho-dependent changes in cell morphology and actin organization. Furthermore, drug-induced microtubule depolymerization induces changes in cell morphology and gene expression that are similar to the changes induced by the expression of active forms of GEF-H1. Furthermore, these effects are inhibited by dominant-negative versions of GEF-H1. Thus, GEF-H1 links changes in microtubule integrity to Rho-dependent regulation of the actin cytoskeleton.
2055236285	The chromosomal replication cycle is strictly coordinated with cell cycle progression in Escherichia coli. ATP-DnaA initiates replication, leading to loading of the DNA polymerase III holoenzyme. The DNA-loaded form of the β clamp subunit of the polymerase binds the Hda protein, which promotes ATP-DnaA hydrolysis, yielding inactive ADP-DnaA. This regulation is required to repress overinitiation. In this study, we have isolated a novel cold-sensitive hda mutant, the hda-185 mutant. The hda-185 mutant caused overinitiation of chromosomal replication at 25°C, which most likely led to blockage of replication fork progress. Consistently, the inhibition of colony formation at 25°C was suppressed by disruption of the diaA gene, an initiation stimulator. Disruption of the seqA gene, an initiation inhibitor, showed synthetic lethality with hda-185 even at 42°C. The cellular ATP-DnaA level was increased in an hda-185-dependent manner. The cellular concentrations of DnaA protein and dnaA mRNA were comparable at 25°C to those in a wild-type hda strain. We also found that multiple copies of the ribonucleotide reductase genes (nrdAB or nrdEF) or dnaB gene repressed overinitiation. The cellular levels of dATP and dCTP were elevated in cells bearing multiple copies of nrdAB. The catalytic site within NrdA was required for multicopy suppression, suggesting the importance of an active form of NrdA or elevated levels of deoxyribonucleotides in inhibition of overinitiation in the hda-185 cells. Cell division in the hda-185 mutant was inhibited at 25°C in a LexA regulon-independent manner, suggesting that overinitiation in the hda-185 mutant induced a unique division inhibition pathway.
2055236309	Clinical isolates from superficial trichosporonosis patients were identified on the basis of DNA relatedness. Trichosporon cutaneum, T. mucoides and our new proposed species, T. domesticum were found in the clinical samples. These findings suggest that the causative agents of superficial trichosporonosis exist in three or more species, and are different from those of deep-seated and mucosa-associated infections.
2055236327	Evidence accumulates that in clinically relevant cell death, both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway synergistically contribute to organ failure. In search for an inhibitor of apoptosis that provides effective blockage of these pathways, we analyzed viral proteins that evolved to protect the infected host cells. In particular, the cowpox virus protein crmA has been demonstrated to be capable of blocking key caspases of both pro-apoptotic pathways. To deliver crmA into eukaryotic cells, we fused the TAT protein transduction domain of HIV to the N terminus of crmA. In vitro, the TAT-crmA fusion protein was efficiently translocated into target cells and inhibited apoptosis mediated through caspase-8, caspase-9, and caspase-3 after stimulation with α-Fas, etoposide, doxorubicin, or staurosporine. The extrinsic apoptotic pathway was investigated following α-Fas stimulation. In vivo 90% of TAT-crmA-treated animals survived an otherwise lethal dose of α-Fas and showed protection from Fas-induced organ failure. To examine the intrinsic apoptotic pathway, we investigated the survival of mice treated with an otherwise lethal dose of doxorubicin. Whereas all control mice died within 31 days, 40% of mice that concomitantly received intraperitoneal injections of TAT-crmA survived. To test the ability to comprehensively block both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathway in a clinically relevant setting, we employed a murine cardiac ischemia-reperfusion model. TAT-crmA reduced infarction size by 40% and preserved left ventricular function. In summary, these results provide a proof of principle for the inhibition of apoptosis with TAT-crmA, which might provide a new treatment option for ischemia-reperfusion injuries.
2943194581	Next-generation sequencing technologies made it possible to assay the effect of rare variants on complex diseases. As an extension of the “common disease-common variant” paradigm, rare variant studies are necessary to get a more complete insight into the genetic architecture of human traits. Association studies of these rare variations show new challenges in terms of statistical analysis. Due to their low frequency, rare variants must be tested by groups. This approach is then hindered by the fact that an unknown proportion of the variants could be neutral. The risk level of a rare variation may be determined by its impact but also by its position in the protein sequence. More generally, the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease architecture may involve specific protein domains or inter-genic regulatory regions. While a large variety of methods are optimizing functionality weights for each single marker, few evaluate variant position differences between cases and controls. Here, we propose a test called DoEstRare, which aims to simultaneously detect clusters of disease risk variants and global allele frequency differences in genomic regions. This test estimates, for cases and controls, variant position densities in the genetic region by a kernel method, weighted by a function of allele frequencies. We compared DoEstRare with previously published strategies through simulation studies as well as re-analysis of real datasets. Based on simulation under various scenarios, DoEstRare was the sole to consistently show highest performance, in terms of type I error and power both when variants were clustered or not. DoEstRare was also applied to Brugada syndrome and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease data and provided complementary results to other existing tests. DoEstRare, by integrating variant position information, gives new opportunities to explain disease susceptibility. DoEstRare is implemented in a user-friendly R package.
2943194702	The experiment was conducted between December 2017 and May 2018 at Bako, Ethiopia to study the effectiveness of traditional (Gombisa, Sack) and Hermetic bag storage structures and storage periods on fungal contamination of stored maize grain on agar plate method. The incidence and frequency of storage fungi was determined at 0, 2, 4 and 6 months of storage periods. The experiment was replicated three times in factorial design. The design was 3×4 in factorial fashion. The treatments were three storage types (Gombisa, sack and Hermetic bag), one variety of maize (Bako hybrid-661) and storage periods (0, 2, 4 and 6) months. The collected data were analyzed statistically using Generalized Linear Model (GLM) procedure of SAS and means that were significantly different were separated using Least Significant Difference (LSD). Fungi were the major causes of deterioration and quality loss on stored maize grains during the storage period. The fungal incidence and frequency significantly different (p<0.05) increased with storage periods. The highest (39.4%) Fusarium species incidence was recorded at the last six months of storage. Fusurium spp. occurred in Gombisa with the highest 29.9% incidence and 23% frequency, respectively. The highest frequency of Aspergillus species 26.7% was recorded in Gombisa whereas the minimum 18% was obtained from Hermetic bag in the six months of storage periods. In this study, Fusurium spp. was the most prevailing storage fungi followed by Aspergillus spp. As a result of this research, the Hermetic bag was determined to be more appropriate for protecting the stored maize grains from fungal attack during the storage periods and the stored grains have low fungal incidence and frequency until initial to four months. Therefore, gombisa and sack storages were inadequate for protecting stored maize from insect pests and fungal attacks. Overall, the hermetic bag storage can protect insect infestation and fungal development and consequently maintains seed viability and nutritional content during storage without use of insecticides.       Key words: Moisture, temperature, humidity, fungi, storage.
2943194932	Deregulation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway drives the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) but understanding of this pathway remains incomplete. Here we report that the damage-specific DNA-binding protein DDB2 is critical for β-catenin-mediated activation of RNF43, which restricts Wnt-signaling by removing Wnt receptors from the cell surface. Reduced expression of DDB2 and RNF43 was observed in human hyperplastic colonic foci. DDB2 recruited EZH2 and β-catenin at an upstream site in the Rnf43 gene, enabling functional interaction with distant TCF4/β-catenin binding sites in the intron of Rnf43. This novel activity of DDB2 was required for RNF43 function as a negative feedback regulator of Wnt-signaling. Mice genetically deficient in DDB2 exhibited increased susceptibility to colon tumor development in a manner associated with higher abundance of the Wnt receptor-expressing cells and greater activation of the downstream Wnt-pathway. Our results identify DDB2 as both a partner and regulator of Wnt-signaling with an important role in suppressing colon cancer development.
2943194995	We analyze the impact of aposematic time and searching efficiency of prey on the temporal and spatio-temporal dynamics of a diffusive prey-predator system. Here, our assumption is that the prey population primarily invests its total time in two activities-(i) defense against predation and (ii) searching for food, followed by growth-induced reproduction, whereas, predators do not involve in self-defense. Moreover, we consider that the reproduction rate of prey and the rate of predation have a negative linear correlation with the amount of time invested for aposematism. Based on the presump- tions, we find that unlike searching efficiency of prey, the aposematic time can diminish the proportion in which prey and predator coexist when it crosses a certain threshold, and at the extreme aposematism, the entire population drives into the extinction. The proposed dynamics undergoes Hopf-bifurcation with respect to the searching efficiency of prey. We examine the individual effect of aposematic time and searching efficiency on the formation of regular Turing patterns-the low to medium to high val-ues of defense-time and food searching efficiency generate 'spots' to 'stripes' to 'holes' pattern, re-spectively; however, the combined impact of both presents only non-Turing 'spot' pattern with the 'predominance of predators,' which happens through the Turing-Hopf bifurcation.
2240753535	In anurans, the most important way of communication is based on acoustic signaling. The advertisement calls of many anuran species play a critical role both for male-male competition and female preferences. Call types, call properties and the female preferences on male farmland green treefrogs (Rhacophorus arvalis) were investigated in this study. Based on recordings from fields, we identified five call types according to spectral and temporal properties; these included release call, distress call and three types of advertisement calls A, B, and C. Advertisement call A was recorded most frequently and was probably the most important one to attract females. Advertisement call B and C were presumed not to relate female selection. There was a positive correlation between the number of calling males in leks and time of continuous calling (p=0.001), percentage of time spent calling (p=0.0003), and the female reproductive intensity (p=0.017), respectively. Two call properties, frequency modulation and call rate, of advertisement call A differ significantly between successfully and unsuccessfully mating males (p=0.0177 for frequency modulation, p=0.0182 for call rate). The frequency modulation, number of pulses per call and the percentage of advertisement call A numbers per advertisement call bout were significant variables in predicting the mating success of males. Of all call properties, call rate was the only one that showed positive correlation with the male body size (p=0.0315). The results of this study suggested that female farmland green treefrogs choose leks with more males in it, and prefer males which call with less frequency modulations, higher call rates, more pulses per call, more calls per call bout or higher percentage of advertisement call A in call bouts.
3149561708	Increasing reports have verified that miRNAs had an important effect on the growth and development in farm animals. To evaluate the possible effect of miR-1596 polymorphisms on chicken economic traits, directly sequencing and polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism, association analysis as well as online software were used. The results showed that aC ( T polymorphism existed in the miR-1596 gene of the Gushi 9 Anka F2 resource population. The association analysis showed that it was significantly relevant with the potential of hydrogen of leg muscle, fat content of dry sample and fat content of fresh sample, shank length at 0 day and 4 weeks of age; leg weight, leg muscle weight, and breast muscle weight (P \ 0.05); and highly signifi- cant association with shank girth at 8 weeks of age and abdominal fat weight (P \ 0.01). We predicted the sec- ondary structure of Gallus gallus-miR-1596 (gga-miR- 1596) and the free energy by using M-fold, which were not altered. MiR-1596 is conserved between chicken and tur- key. Our data implied that miR-1596 might participate in regulating the muscle development and adipogenesis.
2055236421	Abstract The pathology of a Baculovirus (BV) in Aedes triseriatus was studied. The virus infected the cardia, gastric caeca, and the entire stomach of larval midgut epithelium. The progression of the disease was similar to that of other Baculoviruses of the nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) type. Rodshaped nucleocapsids were formed within a Feulgen-positive virogenic stroma and along the nuclear envelope. These nucleocapsids were enveloped by a membranous material and occluded randomly in small irregular and polyhedral proteinic inclusions. The disease differed from other BVs of the NPV type in that the small proteinic inclusions gradually coalesced as they grew, forming large fusiform inclusions. Preliminary mortality studies indicated that early-instar larvae were the most susceptible to the virus.
2055236508	Summary Tumor growth is considered to depend on tumor cell proliferation and on tumor cell motility. The present study investigates in which way these two cellular properties influence the evolving morphological pattern. Computer simulations were performed, where cells were either dividing or moving for a variable distance at a preset probability. The simulation parameters (probability of motility, maximum moving distance) were set interactively. The resulting patterns were evaluated by binary morphological criteria. 13 of 17 binary criteria showed a significant relationship with the simulation parameters (median test: p =
2055236513	Abstract The effects of benzodiazepine inverse agonists on the long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission in hippocampal slices of the guinea pig were examined using an extracellular recording technique. Benzodiazepine inverse agonists, β-carboline-3-carboxylate (β-CCE), 2-phenylpyrazolo [4,3-c]quinolin-3(5H)-one (CGS-8216) and 2-[5-methylthien-3-yl]-2,5-dihydro-3H-pyrazolo [4,3-c]quinolin-3-one (S-135) augmented the magnitude of long-term potentiation induced by tetanic stimulation of input fibers in both the CA1 and the CA3 regions. β-Carboline-3-carboxylate was more effective in augmenting long-term potentiation in CA1 than in CA3. Augmentation of long-term potentiation produced by β-CCE was antagonized by concomitant application of flumazenil, a benzodiazepine receptor antagonist. Therefore, the enhancing action of benzodiazepine inverse agonists on long-term potentiation, which is suggested to be a specific action, mediated by the GABA/benzodiazepine receptor complex, might help to explain the mechanism of the memory-enhancing effects of benzodiazepine inverse agonists, observed in some in vivo behavioral paradigms.
2055236539	Abstract The uptake of l -methionine in Leishmania tropica promastigotes is competitively inhibited by d -methionine which indicates a lack of rigorous stereospecificity for the methionine carrier. l -Ethionine and l -norleucine, as well as a number of neutral, nonpolar amino acids (leucine, isoleucine, valine, and alanine) also inhibit methionine uptake. All these inhibitors are aliphatic amino acids with terminal methyl groups. Kinetic studies showed that ethionine, norleucine, and alanine are also competitive inhibitors of methionine uptake. Excessive influx of methionine is prevented by feedback inhibition as well as transinhibition of the transport system. In the former, increased levels of methionine within the intra-cellular pools inhibit further uptake of the amino acid. In the latter, enhanced levels of other amino acids including those such as tyrosine and lysine which have no affinity for the methionine carrier inhibit methionine transport. Supplementation of the growth medium with methionine does not repress its transport system. The methionine uptake system in L. tropica thus shows broad specificity and is subject to regulation at the level of carrier activity.
2055236567	Several techniques based on stable isotope labeling are used for quantitative MS. These include stable isotope metabolic labeling methods for cells in culture as well as live organisms with the assumption that the stable isotope has no effect on the proteome. Here, we investigate the (15) N isotope effect on Escherichia coli cultures that were grown in either unlabeled ((14) N) or (15) N-labeled media by LC-ESI-MS/MS-based relative protein quantification. Consistent protein expression level differences and altered growth rates were observed between (14) N and (15) N-labeled cultures. Furthermore, targeted metabolite analyses revealed altered metabolite levels between (14) N and (15) N-labeled bacteria. Our data demonstrate for the first time that the introduction of the (15) N isotope affects protein and metabolite levels in E. coli and underline the importance of implementing controls for unbiased protein quantification using stable isotope labeling techniques.
2055236596	Abstract The author herein reports a very rare case of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) with sarcomatous changes of the endometrium. A 40-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital because of abnormal uterine bleeding. Gynecologic examination and imaging modalities revealed a polypoid tumor of the uterine corpus. Uterine curettage biopsy revealed a sarcomatous undifferentiated carcinoma. Simple hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy, extensive lymph node dissection, and omentectomy were performed. The patient was diagnosed as having FIGO stage Ib (T1N0M0) carcinoma, and adjuvant chemotherapy was performed. The patient is now alive 16 months after the operation. Pathologically, a polypoid tumor measuring 3×2×2 cm3 was found in the uterine corpus. Histologically, the tumor consisted of relatively large-sized carcinoma cells without differentiation. The tumor cells have abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli. It was composed of a spindle cell component (40%) and an epithelioid component (60%). A gradual transition between the two was recognized. Immunohistochemically, both elements showed the same immunophenotypes. The carcinoma cells were positive for cytokeratin, vimentin, CA125, CD34, estrogen receptor, progesterone receptor, p53 protein, Ki-67 antigen (80%), synaptophysin, CD56, KIT, and PDGFRA. They were negative for epithelial membrane antigen, CEA, desmin, S100 protein, melanosome, α-smooth muscle actin, chromogranin, and neuron-specific enolase. A molecular genetic analysis revealed no mutations of KIT (exons 9, 11, 13, and 17) and PDGFRA (exons 12 and 18) genes. The final diagnosis was LCNEC with sarcomatous changes.
2055236615	Abstract Cattle, sheep, goats, and horses in most areas of Barbados were examined for ticks. About 68% of the cattle, mostly Holstein dairy cows, and 23% of the sheep, mostly purebred or crossbred black belly sheep, were infested with the southern cattle tick, Boophilus microplus (Canestrini), a vector of bovine babesiosis and anaplasmosis. About 13% of the horses were infested with the tropical horse tick, Anocentor nitens (Neumann), a vector of equine babesiosis. Cattle owners used a variety of acaricides as dusts, sprays, or washes on their cattle for the control of ticks.
2055236658	"Malignant mesothelioma (MM) is a lethal tumor linked with a prior exposure to asbestos in which limited progress has been made so far using conventional therapies. MM is an example of a ""nonimmunogenic"" tumor characterized by a fibrous stroma and an absence of infiltrating T lymphocytes. High levels of transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) produced by mesothelioma cells have been related to the immune tolerance towards the tumor. In order to evaluate the effect of local delivery of cytokines such as interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) by gene transfer, we characterized and used a murine model, AK7, which appeared very similar to human mesothelioma. AK7 cells expressed low levels of major histocompatibility class I and class II antigens and secreted high levels of latent TGF-beta. The TGF-beta pathway in AK7 cells is operative but inefficient because endogenous TGF-beta is predominantly inactive. Treatment of pre-established AK7 tumors by direct intratumoral injection of an adenovirus vector expressing murine IFN-gamma, Ad.mIFN-gamma, led to significant tumor regression. Peripheral tumor infiltration by CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in the treated tumors appeared to be because of the induction of an immune response. Tumor relapse was observed, which could be due to local TGF-beta secretion by remaining tumor cells."
2055236723	Summary: A secreted phosphate-repressible acid phosphatase from Kluyveromyces lactis has been purified and the N-terminal region and an internal peptide have been sequenced. Using synthetic oligodeoxyribonucleotides based on the sequenced regions, the genomic sequence, KIPHO5, encoding the protein has been isolated. The deduced protein, named KIPho5p, consists of 469 amino acids and has a molecular mass of 52 520 Da (in agreement with the data obtained after treatment of the protein with endoglycosidase H). The purified enzyme shows size heterogeneity, with an apparent molecular mass in the range 90-200 kDa due to the carbohydrate content (10 putative glycosylation sites were identified in the sequence). A 16 amino acid sequence at the N-terminus is similar to previously identified signal peptides in other fungal secretory proteins. The putative signal peptide is removed during secretion since it is absent in the mature secreted acid phosphatase. The gene can be induced 400-600-fold by phosphate starvation. Consensus signals corresponding to those described for Saccharomyces cerevisiae PHO4- and PHO2-binding sites are found in the 5′ region. Northern blot analysis of total cellular RNA indicates that the KIPHO5 gene codes for a 1.8 kb transcript and that its expression is regulated at the transcriptional level. Chromosomal hybridization indicated that the gene is located on chromosome II. The KIPHO5 gene of K. lactis is able to functionally complement a pho5 mutation of Sacch. cerevisiae. Southern blot experiments, using the KIPHO5 gene as probe, show that some K. lactis reference strains lack repressible acid phosphatase, revealing a different gene organization for this kind of multigene family of proteins as compared to Sacch. cerevisiae.
2055236777	Abstract Utilisation of ribonucleosides as precursors of DNA biosynthesis was studied in germinating wheat embryos because the reductive pathway leading to deoxyribonucleotides is very difficult to demonstrate in extracts of higher plants in vitro. [5-3H]Cytidine and [6-3H]uridine are incorporated into wheat DNA (RNA-free) via ribonucleotide reduction without intermediate scission of the glycosidic bond. This reaction is observed at 20–30 h after the onset of germination only in aged (2–4-year-old) seeds while the embryos isolated from fresh grains show very little cytidine incorporation; in contrast, thymidine incorporation into DNA between 10 and 18 h of germination is not age dependent. Fresh wheat contains a soluble, heat-stable inhibitor fraction, most probably a modified oligonucleotide, which efficiently prevents cytidine incorporation when added to old embryos together with the labeled nucleoside. This material also inhibits purified Escherichia coli ribonucleotide reductase and is thought to be part of the control system for ribonucleotide reduction in wheat; it may gradually decay during storage of the seeds. Dry wheat embryos do not contain deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates. Pool sizes of dATP and dTTP in germinating embryos were found to reach 1 pmol/μg DNA at 10–15 h of germination (i.e. before ribonucleotide reduction) and were independent of the age of seeds. These data suggest that wheat contains other preformed dexoyribonucleoside derivatives which are phosphorylated at an early time and can initially sustain DNA synthesis. Induction of measurable ribonucleotide reductase activity in fresh winter wheat was for the first time accomplished by 15 days of vernalization of the seeds at +2°C.
2398624207	In C2 muscle cells, retinoic acid (RA) induces growth arrest associated with terminal differentiation. These RA actions are presumed to be mediated through nuclear receptors (RARs and RXRs) that belong to the superfamily of ligand-dependent transcription factors. In this study, we have characterized a myogenic C2 subclone, that unlike parental cells, is resistant to growth inhibition and differentiation by RA. Examination of these RA-sensitive and resistant C2 cells for the expression of retinoid acid receptors revealed a lack of RXR alpha expression at the myoblast stage in resistant C2 cells. To determine the functions of RXR alpha, we introduced an RXR alpha expression vector into RA-resistant C2 cells by transient or stable transfections. Our results show that RXR alpha restores the response to RA in this subclone with respect to AP1 inhibition and growth arrest. These observations indicate that RXR alpha plays a crucial role in mediating RA induced growth arrest of C2 myogenic cells.
2398624438	‘Saffron’ is a new variety of Lupinus hybridus that exhibits numerous and large-shaped butter-colored flowers.
2398624448	Frozen sections of intestine obtained from experimentally infected embryos were satisfactory as a suitable antigen in the indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) test for detection of antibodies to turkey coronaviral enteritis (TCE). Antibodies were detected in infected turkeys at 14 days after infection and persisted for at least 107 days when the 1st experiment was concluded. Antibodies were also detected in infected turkeys at 9 days after infection and persisted for at least 160 days when the 2nd experiment was terminated. The IFA test may be of value as a rapid and economical screening method for TCE antibodies.
2943195274	Focuses on its high values, coconut product; nutritional and health benefits have currently been attributed to its intake, antioxidant and anticancer properties. This research study is aimed at evaluating the phytochemical content of coconut (Cocos nucifera) oil and determines the susceptibility pattern against some selected microbes. The findings revealed that it contained phytochemicals; alkaloid, glycosides, resins, saponins, tannins and terpenoid. Subjected to susceptibility testing on some bacterial and fungal; agar diffusion method was being applied and inhibition zones which indicated its antimicrobial properties. Assay of antibacterial activity of standard bacteria organisms showed that Staphyloccus aureus had the highest susceptibility to coconut oil while Pseudomonas aeroginosa had the least, Candida albicans had a higher susceptibility to coconut oil more than Aspergillus fumigatus in antifungal testing. This was concluded from their average zones of inhibition; 14.55mm (32%) for Staphylococcus aureus, 12.1 mm (27%) for Streptococcus pneumonia, 10.95 mm (24%) for Escherichia coli and 7.7 mm (17%) for Pseudomonas aeroginosa. And for the fungal are 18.5mm (55%) for Candida albicans and 15.1mm (45%) for Aspergillus fumigatus. The utilization of coconut oil should be promoted as a functional food in Nigeria and the use of coconut seed flesh in our diets should be encouraged for health supporting functions and considered to be responsible for the many benefits attributed to its consumption.
2943195907	Prairies, once spanning the Upper Midwest, have now largely been replaced by agriculture. The lack of resources available to pollinators in agricultural fields and practices commonly employed has led to a decline in insect diversity. To enhance sustainable practices, we must better understand how ecosystem services such as pest control and pollination services provided by a diverse insect and pollinator community scale to current farming practices as related to crop yield and how landscape features may positively contribute to insect and pollinator diversity. We examined how landscape heterogeneity relates to insect and pollinator diversity, as well as how insect and pollinator diversity relates to crop yield across common farming practices. We planted 35 single acre sites of Brassica carinata, a generalist flower possibly capable of supporting a diverse insect community. We randomly assigned each site with a combination of three common farming practices: tilling (yes/no), added honey bee hives (yes/no), and treatment with systemic neonicotinoids (yes/no). Insect and pollinator diversity and the surrounding landscape at multiple spatial scales were calculated. We observed a significant positive relationship between insect (and pollinator) diversity with yield in the absence of any farming practice. All farming practices will increase yield. However, farming practices alter the relationship between yield and diversity. The addition of seed treatment or tillage negates the relationship between insect (and pollinator) diversity with yield. Seed treatment alone results in a flat relationship between diversity and yield for all insects and a negative relationship for pollinators. Increased landscape heterogeneity results in a positive relationship between insect diversity at the 1000 m scale and pollinator diversity at the 3000 m scale, suggesting large-scale heterogeneity contributes to overall insect diversity. Our results show that increasing large-scale landscape heterogeneity increases diversity serving as a substitute for common farming practices such as application of pesticides, tilling, or bee hives. Increased heterogeneity could save farmers from the input cost of treatment or tillage, by way of increased insect diversity, while still providing similar yields.
2943195916	1. Long-term survival of Enterococci in dust samples from livestock buildings Dust from livestock buildings is a potential transmission source and reservoir of microorganisms in animal husbandries. The Enterococci, as a potential infectious agent, are ordinary intestinal flora of most mammals and may contaminate surroundings with animal excreta. However, there is a lack of studies about their survival time in dust from farm animal housing. One hundred and thirty-five dust samples collected from various livestock buildings and stored up to 36 years were the focus of the present study. Selective media, the API biochemical test and MALDI-TOF MS were used to isolate and identify surviving Enterococci. The oldest isolate of Enterococcus faecium originated from a 35-year-old dust sample taken from a pig barn. It can be hypothesised that isolates survived in the samples without cell division. Potential pathogens could survive for years in livestock buildings when dust is not removed completely by hygienic measures. 2. Antibiotic resistance of long-term survival Enterococcus faecium isolated from farm animal houses’ dust in Germany The Enterococci, as a potential infectious agent, are ordinary intestinal flora of most mammals and may contaminate surroundings with animal excreta. They are not only intrinsic resistant to several common antibiotics, but also able to develop resistances. Therefore, dust in livestock buildings could be a reservoir for long survival Enterococci and a pivotal vehicle in transmission of antibiotic resistant Enterococci. In this study, one hundred and thirty-five dust samples collected from various livestock buildings and stored up to 36 years. Sixty-six isolates of Enterococcus faeciums were isolated from them. The oldest one was gotten from dust collected in 1981. The antimicrobial sensitivity test of sixteen antibiotics was performed: tigecycline, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, daptomycin, streptomycin, tylosin tartrate, quinupristin/dalfopristin (synercid), penicillin, linezolid, kanamycin, erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, vancomycin, lincomycin, gentamicin and trimethoprim- sulfamethoxazole. Enterococcus faecium are considered to survive about 30 years and keep resistance in dust. The antibiotic susceptibility patterns of these long-surviving Enterococci in animal house dust varied depending on sampling age and animal origin. Some antimicrobial-resistant percentages rose or dropped along with time. The ban of related antibiotics as growth promoters seemed to cause a decline of resistance.
2943195951	During the investigation period in Ili Prefecture, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, 195 and 36 wheat varieties were accessed for their susceptibility to Russian wheat aphid (RWA), ( Diuraphis noxia (Mordvilko)) in 1993 and 1994 respectively. Comparison of infestation grades among 36 wheat varieties by RWA in the two years showed that half of them were within the same grade. The aphid hardly attacked the “One kernel wheat”, Triticum monococcum. 13, 2 and 2 of these varieties consistently showed low ( 60%) infestation rates by RWA respectively. However, there are 18 other varieties displayed obvious change in their infestation grades. In addition, the varieties “Spring Wheat 901” and “Shiyin1 of Beer Barley” being introduced into Tacheng were seriously infested by RWA in 1996.
2943195965	The number of bone marrow cells and their chemotactic activity was studied during malaria infection. Two days after infection of Balb/c mice withPlasmodium berghei, an increase in granulocyte number was observed in the blood. A modified Boyden chamber chemotaxis assay was employed to investigate the mechanism of granulocyte accumulation in the blood. Bone marrow cells from normal mice, from mice during a primary lethal infection and from immune mice after challenge were compared. The complement factor C5a showed chemotactic activity for bone marrow cells; a significant decrease of chemotaxis was only observed after 6 days of primary infection. Extracts of spleen, liver and infected erythrocytes lacked chemotactic activity, or caused inhibition of cell migration. Serum from mice with a 2-day primary infection contained chemotactic activity. The active component was heat labile, protease sensitive and had an estimated molecular weight of 250,000.
2055236925	In the developing sensory cortex, the subplate could serve as a transient relay station between the thalamus and cortical plate and assists the formation of thalamocortical projection. While the thalamus-layer IV connection is formed, the thalamic activation of subplate is diminished. In the present study, we aimed to explore the mechanism which may attribute to the decline of subplate activity. To resolve this issue, the developmental changes of subplate neurons (SPns) in rat somatosensory cortex were examined during the first two postnatal weeks which covers the stages prior and subsequent to the establishment of thalamocortical connection. During development, more SPns exhibited regular-spiking firing pattern and the membrane properties of SPns displayed a continual trend of maturation. In the meantime, the excitability of SPns decreased as revealed by increasing rheobase and rightwardly shifted frequency–current curves. On the other hand, increasing paired-pulse ratio and slowing MK-801 blocking rate were noted during development, implying the reduction of presynaptic transmitter release. Morphologically, the size of SPn soma increased with age while the shape became flat. The total length, branching nodes and segments of dendrites increased significantly during the first week. However, after peaking around day 10, these values decreased, implying a pruning process. Our findings here propose that the reduction of neuronal excitability, synaptic transmission and dendritic complexity may attribute to the decline of functional connectivity between thalamus and subplate and reduction of subplate activity while the thalamocortical pathway is established.
2055236948	The Staphylococcus aureus enterotoxin gene cluster, egc, was detected in isolates from healthy individuals and in those from patients with bacteremia. The egc genes cooccur and are slightly enriched in strains from healthy carriers (present in 63.7% of carriage-associated isolates versus 52.9% of invasive isolates; P = 0.03). Multilocus sequence typing revealed that successful staphylococcal clones usually harbor the egc locus.

Scand J Clin Lab Invest 1993; 53: 811-819.Urinary polyamine excretion has been suggested to reflect hypermetabolism or catabolism in different illnesses. In the present study, the excretion of urinary polyamines was examined in 12 obese subjects (3 men, 9 women aged 32-55 y, body mass index 33.3-64.7 kgm−2) before and during a very low calorie diet (the total calorie intake 2100-3350 kJ). In addition, nitrogen balance, basal energy expenditure (BEE) and serum thyroid hormone levels were examined. During the first week on a very low calorie diet (VLCD) the mean body weight declined from 121.8 ± 27.3 to 117.4 ± 26.2kg (mean ± SD, p < 0.001), and after 12 weeks of treatment body weight was 106.6 ± 24.6 kg. Immediate reduction of BEE from 1.44 ± 0.24 to 1.34 ± 0.24 kcalmin1 (p < 0.001) was found within the first week of therapy and BEE measur...
2055236991	Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) is a non-receptor cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays a key role in the regulation of proliferation and migration of normal and tumor cells. FAK associates with integrin receptors and recruits other molecules to the site of this interaction thus forming a signaling complex that transmits signals from the extracellular matrix to the cell cytoskeleton. Crk-associated substrate (CAS) family members appear to play a pivotal role in FAK regulation of cell migration. Cellular Src bound to FAK phosphorylates CAS proteins leading to the recruitment of a Crk family adaptor molecule and activation of a small GTPase and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) promoting membrane protrusion and cell migration. The relocalization of CAS and signaling through specific CAS family members appears to determine the outcome of this pathway. FAK also plays an important role in regulating cell cycle progression through transcriptional control of the cyclin D1 promoter by the Ets B and Kruppel-like factor 8 (KLF8) transcription factors. FAK regulation of cell cycle progression in tumor cells requires Erk activity, cyclin D1 transcription, and the cyclin-dependent kinase (cdk) inhibitor p27Kip1. The ability of FAK to integrate integrin and growth factor signals resulting in synergistic promotion of cell migration and proliferation, and its potential regulation by nuclear factor kappa B (NFkappaB) and p53 and a ubiquitously expressed inhibitory protein, suggest that it is remarkable in its capacity to integrate multiple extracellular and intracellular stimuli.

2055237062	ABSTRACT Staphylococcus epidermidis strain UC7032 was isolated from ready-to-eat cured meat and is heteroresistant to glycopeptide antibiotics. The draft whole-genome analysis revealed that this strain shows common characteristics typical of strains that are involved in nosocomial infections.
2055237077	Influenza virus infection induces apoptosis in cultured cells with an augmented expression of Fas (APO-1/CD95). Caspases, a family of cysteine proteases structurally related to interleukin-1-β-eonverting enzyme (ICE), play crucial roles in apoptosis induced by various stimuli, including Fas. However, activation of the caspase-cascade seems to be different in various pathways of apoptotic stimuli. We therefore examined the involvement of caspases in influenza virus-induced apoptosis using caspase inhibitors. We found that z-VAD-fmk and z-IETD-fmk effectively inhibited virus-induced apoptosis, whereas Ac-DEVD-CHO and Ac-YVAD-CHO showed partial and little effect on virus-induced cell death, respectively. Consistently, caspase-3-like activity, but not caspase-1-like activity, was increased in the virus-infected cells. The transfection of plasmids encoding viral inhibitors of caspase (v-FLIP or crmA) into HeLa cells inhibited apoptosis by virus infection. The peptide inhibitors of caspases used in this study did not inhibit viral replication. We conclude that influenza virus infection activates some caspases, and that this activation may be downstream of viral replication.

2055237091	Neurodevelopmental disruptions caused by obstetric complications play a role in the etiology of several phenotypes associated with neuropsychiatric diseases and cognitive dysfunctions. Importantly, it has been noticed that epigenetic processes occurring early in life may mediate these associations. Here, DNA methylation signatures at IGF2 (insulin-like growth factor 2) and IGF2BP1-3 (IGF2-binding proteins 1-3) were examined in a sample consisting of 34 adult monozygotic (MZ) twins informative for obstetric complications and cognitive performance. Multivariate linear regression analysis of twin data was implemented to test for associations between methylation levels and both birth weight (BW) and adult working memory (WM) performance. Familial and unique environmental factors underlying these potential relationships were evaluated. A link was detected between DNA methylation levels of two CpG sites in the IGF2BP1 gene and both BW and adult WM performance. The BW-IGF2BP1 methylation association seemed due to non-shared environmental factors influencing BW, whereas the WM-IGF2BP1 methylation relationship seemed mediated by both genes and environment. Our data is in agreement with previous evidence indicating that DNA methylation status may be related to prenatal stress and later neurocognitive phenotypes. While former reports independently detected associations between DNA methylation and either BW or WM, current results suggest that these relationships are not confounded by each other.
2055237105	Abstract Accumulating evidence indicates that the insulin-like growth factors (IGFs) function not only as mitogenic factors, but also as promoters of cell motility. In this article we review the current knowledge concerning the biochemical mechanisms whereby the IGFs activate cell motility. A key aspect of IGF-stimulated cell motility is the ability of IGFs to promote actin polymerization at the leading edge of the cell. This effect of the IGFs is mediated by activation and autophosphorylation of the type I IGF receptor, followed by docking of insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1), stimulation of phosphatidylinositol (PI) 3-kinase, and possibly activation of the small GTPase Rac. IGF-stimulated cell motility also requires the formation of new adhesions, a process associated with tyrosine phosphorylation of paxillin and focal adhesion kinase. Determining the biochemical mechanisms by which IGFs regulate cell motility should allow for a better understanding of bone remodeling, neurite outgrowth, tumor metastasis, placental formation, and skin and blood vessel repair . © 1997, Elsevier Science Inc.

2055237110	Summary Temporal separaton of transcription and translation during nitrate reductase induction oin Candida utilis was achieved by the use of actinomycin D and cycloheximide. The yeast failed to synthesize nitrate reductase when nitrate was not provided during transcription. Nitrate thus appeared to induce during transcription the capacity to synthesize nitrate reductase. Presence of nitrate, on the other hand, was not obligatory during translation except for its essential role in maintaining the stability of nitrate reductase after its formation as well as its mRNA.
2055237312	Exposure to ambient air pollution particles (PM(10)) has been associated with increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Inhaled pollutants induce a pulmonary and systemic inflammatory response that is thought to exacerbate cardiovascular disease. The 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) have been shown to have anti-inflammatory effects that could contribute to their beneficial effect in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to determine the effects of statins on PM(10)-induced cytokine production in human bronchial epithelial cells (HBECs) and alveolar macrophages (AMs). Primary HBECs and AMs are obtained from resected human lung. Cells are pretreated with different concentrations of atorvastatin for 24 hours and then exposed to 100 microg/mL urban air pollution particles (EHC-93). Cytokine levels (interleukin-1beta, interleukin-8, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, interleukin-6, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) are measured at messenger RNA and protein levels using real-time polymerase chain reaction and bead-based multiplex immunoassay, respectively. PM(10) exposure increases production of these cytokines by both cell types. Atorvastatin attenuates PM(10)-induced messenger RNA expression and cytokine production by AMs but not by HBECs. It is concluded that statins can modulate the PM(10)-induced inflammatory response in the lung by reducing mediator production by AMs.
2055237338	The biosynthetic gene cluster of porothramycin, a sequence-selective DNA alkylating compound, was identified in the genome of producing strain Streptomyces albus subsp. albus (ATCC 39897) and sequentially characterized. A 39.7 kb long DNA region contains 27 putative genes, 18 of them revealing high similarity with homologous genes from biosynthetic gene cluster of closely related pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD) compound anthramycin. However, considering the structures of both compounds, the number of differences in the gene composition of compared biosynthetic gene clusters was unexpectedly high, indicating participation of alternative enzymes in biosynthesis of both porothramycin precursors, anthranilate, and branched L-proline derivative. Based on the sequence analysis of putative NRPS modules Por20 and Por21, we suppose that in porothramycin biosynthesis, the methylation of anthranilate unit occurs prior to the condensation reaction, while modifications of branched proline derivative, oxidation, and dimethylation of the side chain occur on already condensed PBD core. Corresponding two specific methyltransferase encoding genes por26 and por25 were identified in the porothramycin gene cluster. Surprisingly, also methyltransferase gene por18 homologous to orf19 from anthramycin biosynthesis was detected in porothramycin gene cluster even though the appropriate biosynthetic step is missing, as suggested by ultra high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detection-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-DAD-MS) analysis of the product in the S. albus culture broth.
2055237339	The time of pregnancy, birth, and lactation, is characterized by numerous specific alterations in several systems of the maternal body. Peripartum-associated changes in physiology and behavior, as well as their underlying molecular mechanisms, have been the focus of research since decades, but are still far from being entirely understood. Also, there is growing evidence that pregnancy and lactation are associated with a variety of alterations in neural plasticity, including adult neurogenesis, functional and structural synaptic plasticity, and dendritic remodeling in different brain regions. All of the mentioned changes are not only believed to be a prerequisite for the proper fetal and neonatal development, but moreover to be crucial for the physiological and mental health of the mother. The underlying mechanisms apparently need to be under tight control, since in cases of dysregulation, a certain percentage of women develop disorders like preeclampsia or postpartum mood and anxiety disorders during the course of pregnancy and lactation. This review describes common peripartum adaptations in physiology and behavior. Moreover, it concentrates on different forms of peripartum-associated plasticity including changes in neurogenesis and their possible underlying molecular mechanisms. Finally, consequences of malfunction in those systems are discussed.

2398625090	Hela cells, a transformed human epithelial cell line, attach to various substrata but subsequent spreading is specific to collagen or gelatin. The spreading is initiated by the activation of phospholipase (PLA) which produces arachidonic acid (AA) as a consequence of cell surface collagen receptor clustering. This study examines the mechanism of PLAactivation and which phospholipids are hydrolyzed by PIA to release AA in response to Hela cell adhesion to a gelatin substratum. The levels of phosphatidyicholine decreases, among various phospholipids, during attachment and spreading of Hela cells. Lysophosphatidyicholine Is the only lysophospholipids formed during ileLa cell adhesion indicating that clustered collagen receptors activate PLAto hydrolyze posphatidylcholine to AA and lysophosphatidylcholine. Among various molecular entitles which are known to regulate PLA activation, we have previously shown that PLA2 activation is not mediated by either changes in + levels, alkalinization of cytoplasmic p11, or activation of protein hinase C. It is also likely that PIA2 activation is not mediated by either pertussis or cholera toxinsensitive G proteins as those toxins do not affect both AA release and cell spreading.

2398625363	Summary Jackfruits (Artocarpus heterophyllus Lam.) are consumed in natura by the most diverse sectors of the population, and their high perishability lead to high indexes of postharvest losses, leading to prejudice for the producers of this fruit. Thus the objectives of this work were to evaluate the effects of the drying temperature (50, 60 and 70 °C) and the final moisture content (20 and 25%) on the chemical and sensory characteristics of dried jackfruit. The overall results obtained showed that the dehydrated jackfruit had a dry matter content of from 74.2 to 80.9%, ash content from 3.1 to 3.8%, protein content from 3.2 to 6.6%, fat content from 0.09 to 1.2% and carbohydrate content from 89.8 to 92.4%. The sensory evaluation showed that the most accepted product (average of 5.95) was dehydrated at 50 °C, with a final moisture content of 20%, showing that this could be a food alternative for areas producing jackfruit.

2398625527	Lipoprotein lipase is a key enzyme in hydrolysis of triglyceride and exchange of lipids between lipoproteins in circulation. It has also been found for lipoprotein lipase to play key roles in number of pathophysiological conditions. Over hundred different lipoprotein lipase gene variants have been described in the literature. Lipoprotein lipase gene has been observed as a key factor involved in the pathogenesis of hypertriglyceridemia, coronary heart disease and pancreatitis. In Croatian population the following gene variants have been described: -93T/G, D9N, V108V, N291S, S447X, Pvu II i Hind III. The most important finding was the first mutation W86R which caused familial hypertriglyceridemia. The investigation of mutations and polymorphisms may open the new directions for molecular diagnostics of hypertriglyceridemia and help us recognize the new mutations. Differential diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia and medical practice involved in their prevention and treatment may be improved by knowing the frequency of lipoprotein lipase gene variants as well as their influence on lipid profile.
2398625543	To increase the hydrogen-producing capacity of Pantoea agglomerans BH18, isolated from mangrove sludge, we constructed a stable transposon mutagenesis library of this strain. A Tn7-based transposon was randomly inserted into the genomic DNA. Mutants were screened by kanamycin resistance and identified by amplification of the inserted transposon sequences. A mutant strain TB34 was isolated, whose hydrogen production capacity was significantly improved compared to the wild type strain. In seawater-containing medium supplemented with 10 g x L(-1) glucose and had an initial pH of 7.0, the hydrogen yield (H2/glucose) of the mutant strain was (2.04 +/- 0.04) mol x mol(-1), which was 43% higher than that of the wild type strain. The mutant TB34 showed steady hydrogen production capacity for five consecutive passages. Different carbon sources were tested in the hydrogen production by the mutant TB34 and the results showed that both the mutant strain TB34 and the wild type strain BH18 were able to produce hydrogen on sucrose, glucose and fructose. However, different from the wild type strain, the mutant strain TB34 was also able to produce hydrogen using xylose as substrate, with a hydrogen yield (H2/xylose) of (1.34 +/- 0.09) mol x mol(-1), indicating a broader substrate spectrum in the mutant.

2398625695	A Gram-positive strain designated as MSL-14T isolated from a soil sample collected from Bigeum Island, Korea, was subjected to polyphasic taxonomy. The isolate was strictly aerobic. Cells were short rods and motile. Optimum growth temperature and pH was 28 degrees C and 7.0, respectively. It was characterized chemotaxonomically as having a cell-wall peptidoglycan type based on LL-2,6-diaminopimelic acid and MK-8(H4) as the predominant menaquinone. The major fatty acids were iso-C16:0, C17:1 omega8c, and C18:1 omega9c. The G+C content was 67.6 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain MSL-14T is affiliated to the genus Nocardioides and formed a distinct lineage within the genus. MSL-14T showed highest sequence similarity to Nocardioides aestuarii JCM 12125T, having a similarity of 96.5%. Based on the 16S rRNA gene sequence divergence and phenotypic characteristics, it is proposed that strain MSL-14T should be classified as representing a novel member of the genus Nocardioides, for which we propose the name Nocardioides tritolerans sp. nov. The type strain is strain MSL-14T (=KCTC 19289T= DSM 19320T).
2398625757	Studies were conducted to evaluate the combined effect of selected acidulants (acetic, citric, malic, and phosphoric acid) and heat on foodborne pathogens (Escherichia coli O157:H7 and Listeria monocytogenes) in pureed green beans. To establish a consistent reference point for comparison, the molar concentrations of the acids remained constant while the acid-to-puree ratio, titratable acidity, and undissociated acid were either measured or calculated for a target acidified green beans at a pH of 3.8, 4.2, and 4.6. The D-values at 149°F were used as the criteria for acid efficacy. Generally, acetic acid (puree, pH 3.8 and 4.2) represented the most effective acid with comparatively low D-values irrespective of the target microorganism. A 10-s heating at 149°F inactivated approximately 106 CFU/ml of E. coli O157:H7 in pureed beans at pH 3.8. The efficacy of acetic acid is likely related to the elevated percent titratable acidity, undissociated acid, and acid-to-puree ratio. The effectiveness (which in this s...

2943196289	ABSTRACT Background The influence of genetics on variation in DNA methylation (DNAme) is well documented. Yet confounding from population stratification is often unaccounted for in DNAme association studies. Existing approaches to address confounding by population stratification using DNAme data may not generalize to populations or tissues outside those in which they were developed. To aid future placental DNAme studies in assessing population stratification, we developed an ethnicity classifier, PlaNET (Placental DNAme Elastic Net Ethnicity Tool), using five cohorts with Infinium Human Methylation 450k BeadChip array (HM450k) data from placental samples that is also compatible with the newer EPIC platform. Results Data from 509 placental samples was used to develop PlaNET and show that it accurately predicts (accuracy = 0.938, kappa = 0.823) major classes of self-reported ethnicity/race (African: n = 58, Asian: n = 53, Caucasian: n = 389), and produces ethnicity probabilities that are highly correlated with genetic ancestry inferred from genome-wide SNP arrays (>2.5 million SNP) and ancestry informative markers (n = 50 SNPs). PlaNET’s ethnicity classification relies on 1860 HM450K microarray sites, and over half of these were linked to nearby genetic polymorphisms (n = 955). Our placental-optimized method outperforms existing approaches in assessing population stratification in placental samples from individuals of Asian, African, and Caucasian ethnicities. Conclusion PlaNET provides an improved approach to address population stratification in placental DNAme association studies. The method can be applied to predict ethnicity as a discrete or continuous variable and will be especially useful when self-reported ethnicity information is missing and genotyping markers are unavailable. PlaNET is available as an R package at (https://github.com/wvictor14/planet).
2943196677	The seeds of sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) have high levels of proteins and unsaturated fatty acids, and due to their nutraceutical potential, their demand in the international market has increased in recent years. This study aims at developing a method for rooting juvenile cuttings of sacha inchi in microtunnels, in order to propagate plants with superior genetic traits and shorten production cycles. Two experiments were carried out in randomized complete block designs. In the first experiment were used juvenile cuttings of 8 cm and 2000 ppm of indolebutyric acid (IBA) according to previous studies, and tested two types of substrates (sand and Jiffy pellets) and two frequencies of nebulized irrigation (once per day and three times per day, each application was for 30 seconds). In the second experiment were used again cuttings of 8 cm, and tested three levels of leaf area (25, 50 and 75 cm2) and five concentrations of IBA (0, 1000, 2000, 4000 and 6000 ppm). Data were submitted to analysis of variance and means were compared by Tukey test at 5% probability. The results show that using Jiffy pellets, one nebulized irrigation per day, juvenile cuttings of 8 cm length with 75 cm2 of leaf area, and 2000 ppm of IBA induced high percentages of rooting (93.3%) and the best root formation in the process of vegetative propagation of sacha inchi.
2943196694	Noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) identify a large family of RNAs that do not encode proteins and represent an important group of tumor biomarkers, directly involved in the process of tumor pathogenesis and progression. Many of them have also been identified in biological fluids of patients with cancer, especially blood, suggesting their role as an emerging class of circulating biomarkers. Many ncRNAs, both miRNAs and lncRNAs, are deregulated in sarcoma tissues, with the most consistent data in osteosarcomas. In patients with osteosarcoma, the role of ncRNAs as circulating biomarkers is taking enormous value, above all for their ability to vary expression levels during disease progression and in response to therapy. In this mini-review, we summarize the main studies supporting the role of circulating ncRNAs in monitoring disease status in patients with osteosarcoma.
2943196787	Predation has shaped many facets of the ecology of plovers, including their life history traits, behaviors, and demography. Moreover, conservation often emphasizes managing predators to increase population size. I reviewed literature addressing impacts of predation on survivorship and reproductive success of plovers, as well as four management approaches to ameliorate the negative effects of predation on population growth; most evidence comes from a few species that are threatened or endangered. Three of the four approaches seek to increase productivity by decreasing risk of predation of eggs and chicks by managing: (1) humans, attractants they provide, and disturbance of plovers; (2) habitat to increase availability and quality; (3) predator abundance or behavior using lethal or nonlethal methods; and (4) plover population size directly through captive propagation. The success of predator management is rarely monitored using vital rate data. For the threatened population segment of the Snowy Plover, data suggest that lethal removal has had a strong positive effect on productivity and population growth; even where lethal control is not used, populations are growing owing to immigration from areas where lethal removal of predators is routinely practiced.
2055237399	Tachykinins are vasoactive and smooth muscle-contracting peptides with widespread localizations. Tachykinins have been localized in the nerve fibres that supply the testes, in the Leydig cells of different animal species, and also in Sertoli cells of the Siberian hamster testes. The presence of substance P (SP) has also been demonstrated in ejaculated human spermatozoa and in the seminal plasma. Tachykinins have been shown to inhibit the release of testosterone by testicular fragments or by isolated Leydig cells in vitro. Acting on Sertoli cells, tachykinins have been shown to stimulate the release of lactate and transferrin by these cells in vitro, and also to stimulate aromatase activity. Leydig and Sertoli cells express the Preprotachykinin A gene, and this fact strongly suggests that tachykinins can be synthesized in the testes. These findings suggest that tachykinins may have a physiological function in the testes as modulators of the functions of the different cell types contained in these organs.
2055237452	It has been recently reported that the female steroid hormone 17β-estradiol enhances synaptic transmission and the magnitude of long-term potentiation (LTP) in adult rodent hippocampus. Moreover, 17β-estradiol ameliorates cognitive and memory function in postmenopausal women. Since aging is associated with an alteration of synaptic plasticity (e.g., higher susceptibility to long-term depression [LTD]), we examined whether 17β-estradiol alters the expression of LTD in aged rats. We now report that the induction of LTD recorded from CA1 hippocampal neurons of aged rats is suppressed by 17β-estradiol treatment, which produced only a minimal effect in suppressing LTD in adult rats. These results suggest that estrogen may act to improve memory by suppressing forgetfulness via a synaptic mechanism, such as LTD.
2055237453	Epigenetic phenomena in animals and plants are mediated by DNA methylation and stable chromatin modifications. There has been considerable interest in whether environmental factors modulate the establishment and maintenance of epigenetic modifications, and could thereby influence gene expression and phenotype. Chemical pollutants, dietary components, temperature changes and other external stresses can indeed have long-lasting effects on development, metabolism and health, sometimes even in subsequent generations. Although the underlying mechanisms remain largely unknown, particularly in humans, mechanistic insights are emerging from experimental model systems. These have implications for structuring future research and understanding disease and development.
2055237460	The conventional methods for routine enterococci species identification are usually based on phenotypic characteristics. However, in recent years, some studies have defined specific probes based on both 16S and 23S rRNA genes for the identification of some Enterococcus spp. A set of probes based on the 16S rRNA gene has been developed in order to evaluate the usefulness of a six-step biochemical key for species level identification of enterococci. Probe specificity has been evaluated with type collection and environmental strains by dot blot hybridisation. A high correlation was obtained between biochemical key and hybridisation identifications. This set of probes provides a confirmative method for phenotypic species identification.
2055237511	Infection by pathogenic fungi involves breaching the outer layer of the host by either mechanical or enzymatic means. Subtilisin-like proteinases are considered to be important in the infection process of entomopathogenic, nematophagous, and mycoparasitic fungi. Little is known regarding the expression of such proteinases by plant pathogenic fungi. Magnaporthe poae, a fungal pathogen of Kentucky bluegrass, expressed a subtilisin-like proteinase, proteinase Mp1, in the infected roots. Antibody was produced against the purified enzyme. From immunoblot analysis, expression of the proteinase in infected roots correlated with increasing severity of disease symptoms. Sequence analysis of a genomic clone indicated proteinase Mp1 was homologous to other fungal subtilisin-like proteinases. DNA gel blot analysis indicated proteinase Mp1 was encoded by a small gene family.
2055237581	Dogs are descended from wolves, probably the gray wolf. Some scientists argue that, because dogs and wolves can and do interbreed, they shouldn’t be considered to be separate species at all. They believe that domestic dogs are only a subspecies or variant of the gray wolf, Canis lupus, and ought to be called Canis lupus familiaris (the familiar or domestic wolf) instead of Canis familiaris (the familiar or domestic dog). Although the ability to interbreed and produce fertile offspring is a triedand-true criterion for recognizing that two populations are really variants of a single species, the reality is more nuanced. We cannot know whether dog-wolf hybrids will thrive and survive, or die out, in the long run.
2055237606	A system is described for the automatic collection of small samples of blood from conscious rats. Rats bearing chronic indwelling i.v. catheters were connected via swivels to a multichannel peristaltic pump, solenoid valves and a fraction collector. A microcomputer controlled the operations involved in the removal of blood and its deposition into a fraction collector for subsequent direct radioimmunoassay for GH. Blood samples of 10-20 microliter could be collected, into a total volume of 100 microliter heparinized saline, from up to eight rats simultaneously every few minutes for many hours. This collection method avoided major blood loss and did not require transfusions of donor blood to maintain blood volume. Using a double-lumen cannula it was possible to inject or infuse into the animals while sampling blood. The system was used to investigate in detail the secretion of GH in conscious male rats. The 3-hourly endogenous secretory rhythm of GH was maintained for up to 44 h with episodes of GH secretion being multicomponent. Endogenous secretion was suppressed by constant i.v. infusions of somatostatin, with repetitive sampling showing in detail a rapid rebound secretion of GH after terminating the somatostatin infusions. Four injections of a fragment of GH-releasing factor, given at 3-hourly intervals, produced entrained GH responses, but the subsequent recovery of endogenous GH pulsing was delayed for up to 12 h. This method for the automatic microsampling of blood in small animals gives a very detailed description of the blood levels of hormones secreted in a highly episodic fashion, and could be widely applicable to other endocrine studies.
2055237673	One of the most important experiments in neurophysiology in the twentieth century took place in the physiology laboratories at the University of Otago, New Zealand, in August 1951. The group of researchers led by John Eccles convincingly established that synaptic transmission in the central nervous system was a chemical process. This work was the culmination of a long debate between advocates of electrical and chemical transmission. The conclusions overturned Eccles’s previous theories of an electrical “Golgi-cell” mechanism and represent a pivotal moment in the history of neuroscience.
2055237681	Bivalent gene is a gene marked with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 epigenetic modification in the same area, and is proposed to play a pivotal role related to pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells. Identification of these bivalent genes and understanding their functions are important for further research of lineage specification and embryo development. So far, lots of genome-wide histone modification data were generated in mouse and human ES cells. These valuable data make it possible to identify bivalent genes, but no comprehensive data repositories or analysis tools are available for bivalent genes currently. In this work, we develop BGDB, the database of bivalent genes. The database contains 6897 bivalent genes in human and mouse ES cells, which are manually collected from scientific literature. Each entry contains curated information, including genomic context, sequences, gene ontology and other relevant information. The web services of BGDB database were implemented with PHP + MySQL + JavaScript, and provide diverse query functions.  Database URL: http://dailab.sysu.edu.cn/bgdb/
2055237699	Background: To secure pH homeostasis, the central respiratory network must permanently adapt its rhythmic motor drive to environment and behaviour. In neonates, it is commonly admitted that the retrotrapezoid/parafacial respiratory group of neurons of the ventral medulla plays the primary role in the respiratory response to acidosis, although the serotonergic system may also contribute to this response. Methodology/Principal Findings: Using en bloc medullary preparations from neonatal mice, we have shown for the first time that the respiratory response to acidosis is abolished after pre-treatment with the serotonin-transporter blocker fluoxetine (25–50 mM, 20 min), a commonly used antidepressant. Using mRNA in situ hybridization and immunohistology, we have also shown the expression of the serotonin transporter mRNA and serotonin-containing neurons in the vicinity of the RTN/pFRG of neonatal mice. Conclusions: These results reveal that the serotonergic system plays a pivotal role in pH homeostasis. Although obtained in vitro in neonatal mice, they suggest that drugs targeting the serotonergic system should be used with caution in infants, pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers.
2055237823	The importance of Lactococcus lactis biovar diacetylactis (L. diacetylactis) in the dairy industry is due to its ability to produce aroma compounds, such as acetoin and diacetyl, from citrate. The first step in citrate utilization is its uptake by the cells. In L. diacetylactis, the citrate transport system is encoded by the citQRP operon. We have previously proposed that expression of citQRP operon is regulated at the post-transcriptional level. In this paper, we show that the cit mRNA is processed at a complex secondary structure in L. diacetylactis and Escherichia coli. This secondary structure includes the 5′-terminal two-thirds of citQ and the overlap between citQ and citR. Primer-extension analysis revealed that the major cleavage sites are located upstream of citR and within citQ. In an attempt to identify the enzyme(s) responsible for this cleavage, we have analyzed this processing in E.␣coli mutants deficient in endoribonucleases. A comparative analysis of cit mRNA degradation was performed in RNase E and RNase III mutants and in wild-type strains using Northern blot hybridization. This analysis revealed that the cit transcript is degraded into several breakdown products, which are significantly stabilized in the mutant lacking RNase III. Our results indicate that the complex secondary structure has a critical role in the control of the expression of cit mRNA. A model for processing is discussed.
2055237828	Angiotensin II (A II) stimulates adrenal glomerulosa cells releasing mineralocorticoids; however, little is known about the A II effect on glucocorticoids output. The present study has been designed in order to see if A II could modify in vitro spontaneous and ACTH-induced corticosterone (B) release from both fasciculata-reticularis enriched and total adrenal cells. The results indicate that A II at 10(-12), 10(-11), 10(-10) and 10(-6) M concentrations did not modify basal B production and A II 10(-9), 10(-8) and 10(-7) M decreased basal B production from total adrenal cells. Whereas A II (10(-10)-10(-6) M) stimulated B release from fasciculata-reticularis enriched cells. On the one hand, 10(-8) M A II significantly decreased ACTH-elicited B release from total adrenal cells; effect completely abolished by saralasin (SAR, 10(-8) M), a specific A II receptor blocker. On the other hand, 10(-8) M A II did not modify ACTH-induced B release from fasciculata-reticularis enriched cells. Finally, 10(-10) to 10(-6) M A II and 22 pM ACTH stimulated aldosterone output from total adrenal cells; while, fasciculata-reticularis enriched cells did not secrete any measurable amount of aldosterone under basal condition and after incubation with A II. These data further suggest a regulatory role of A II in the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal gland.
2055237829	There is not agreement on which is the most useful and reproducible test to diagnose GH deficiency. To asses the degree of reproductiveness of physiological and pharmacological test we studied 15 prepuberal childre(14 ♂: l♀;CA (X±SD) 10.5±2.0 years; BA 7.75±2.3 years with short stature(Height SDS -1.9to -3.6) and abnormal growth rate. In all children spontaneous overninght GH secretion (SGH)was performed, followed by clonidine test(Clo)in 8 children and arginine test(Arg)in 7. The same protocol was repeated a week later, GH was measured by RIA. Variability was expressed as the coefficient of variation (CV) of all repeated tests. Results: CV for mean SGH were significantly lower than those for Clo and Arg (p 2.5ng/ml in both oportunities(5 of GA;5 of GB and 3 GC).1 patient showed values <2.5 ng /ml in two ocassions (GC) and 1 had variable means of SGH (GB). Conclusions: This study shows that SGH is most reproducible test. The lack of correlation between CV indicates that variability may be characteistic of each test. Normality of the GH secretory status could not be stablished with the tests used.
2055237879	Cherry juice from one cultivar was fermented for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h using Lactobacillus acidophilus, and its effects related to management of hyperglycemia, hypertension, inhibition of Helicobacter pylori, and proliferation of probiotic Bifidobacterium longum were evaluated using in vitro models. Cherry extract was fermented by initially adjusting the pH to 6.0 and at the natural acidic pH. Analysis was carried out by adjusting the pH and at fermented acidic pH at each time point from each of the two samples. Total soluble phenolics decreased over a period of 72 h for initial pH adjusted samples whereas it increased or remained constant for natural acidic pH samples. DPPH linked antioxidant activity and α-glucosidase inhibitory activity decreased for samples where final pH was adjusted whereas it increased for natural acidic pH samples. Fermentation led to a decrease in hypertension-relevant ACE inhibitory activity for all samples. Natural acidic pH samples had Helicobacter pylori inhibitory activity at ...
2055237901	Two tagged proteome studies offer the most intimate and detailed view into the inner works of yeast cells to date.
2055237915	High affinity binding of 3H-spiperone to D-2 dopamine receptors was measured in membrane fractions prepared from striata of male Sprague-Dawley rats aged 0.75-25 months. 3H-Spiperone bound with approximately 0.11 nM affinity in all age groups studied. The maximum number of D-2 receptors initially increased with age, peak adult levels being reached by 4 months of age. Receptor density declined by 33% over the next 7 months and no further loss of receptors was apparent between 11 and 25 months of age. Such a time-course suggests a loss of rat D-2 receptors that occurs, at least in this strain, earlier than has previously been appreciated, and appears to be in agreement with preliminary positron emission tomographic studies in living man.
2398626588	A new and distinct cultivar of Petunia plant named ‘Sunsurfpiusi’, characterized by its compact and mounding plant habit; vigorous growth habit; freely branching habit; early and freely flowering habit; long flowering period; medium-sized purple-colored flowers; and good garden performance.
2398626654	Objective To investigate the effects of human telomerase reverse transcriptase(hTERT)promoter and survivin promoter in tumor-specific gene therapy.Methods hTERT promoter and survivin promoter were obtained by PCR using Jurkat genomic DNA.Recombinant adeno-associated virus(AAV)vectors containing exogenous TRAIL gene and hTERT promoter or survivin promoter were constructed and designated as rAAV-hTERT-TRAIL(h/TRAIL)or rAAV-survivin-TRAIL(s/TRAIL).rAAV particles were obtained after packing and purification and the virus titer was calculated by real-time PCR.Human hepatocellular carcinoma(HCC)cells of the lines SMMC-7721,BEL-7402,HepG2,and Hep3B.and primary human hepatocytes(PHHs)were transfected with h/TRAIL or s/TRAIL.Flow cytometry was used to detect the expression of the reporter gene enhanced green fluorescent protein(EGFP),so as to examine the activitV of the two promoters.MTT method was used to detect the activity of the cells.Fifteen BalB/C mice underwent subcutaneous injection of SMMC-7721 cells so as to establish tumor models and then were randomly divided into 3 groups to undergo intra-tumor injection of h/TRAIL,s/TRAIL,or PBS.The growth of tumor was observed for 5 weeks,and then peripheral blood samples were collected to examine the serum AST and ALT levels.TUNEL was used to detect the apoptosis if the tumor cells.Results All the SMMC-7721,BEL-7402,HepG2,and Hep3B cells driven by both h/TRAIL and s/TRAIL showed EGFP expression,however,no fluorescence could be seen in the PHHs transfected with h/TRAIL and s/TRAIL.MTT method showed that 72 hours after the transfection of h/TRAIL and s/TRAIL the survival rates of the SMMC-7721,BEL-7402,and HepG2 cells all decreased,however,the survival rate of the Hep3B cells and PHHs did not changed significantly.The size of the subcutaneous tumor of the mice of the h/TRAIL group was 625 mm3,significantly smaller than that of the PBS group(1500 mm3,P＜0.05),however.the tumor size of the s/TRAIL group was 1117 mm3,not significantly different from that of the PBS group(P＞0.05).The AST and ALT levels of all mice did not change significantly 5 weeks after the intratumor injection.Conclusion Tumor-specific promoters are promising candidates in targeted tumor gene therapy.

2398626836	Objective To analyze the microbial diversity in healthy and HLB-affected Catharanthus roseus under manual-grafting conditions and to find the association between the endophytic bacteria and the HLB pathogen. Methods The endophytic bacterial communities were delineated by using the traditional culturable approach and cultivation-independent techniques based on 16S rRNA gene. The endophytic bacteria were isolated from surface-sterilized C. roseus midribs of leaves and phloem of stems and roots by plating and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). Results By anaerobic culture, we obtained 67 strains that were identified 29 genus by GenBank. Curtobacterium sp. , Erwinia sp., Bacillus cereus and Brevundimonas sp. , Bacillus sp. were the dominant bacterial population in diseased and healthy C. roseus. However, Staphylococcus equorum was the common dominant isolate in both C. roseus. We picked 188 and 182 positive clones in 16S rDNA libraries of diseased and healthy C. roseus that were respectively restricted by the HaeIII, MspI, RsaI restriction endonuclease. Based on the similarity of the RFLP banding profiles in diseased and healthy C. roseus, we obtained 16, 23 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units, OTUs) respectively. In addition to Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, Candidatus Liberibacter sp. was the dominant bacterial population only in diseased C. roseus. Conclusions With the infection of 'Ca. L. asiaticus', the diversity in diseased C. roseus decreased. The endophytic bacteria isolated from diseased and healthy C. roseus are abundant and have remarkable differences in the composition and function, suggesting that its endophytic bacteria might be inhibited by the HLB pathogen.
2943197539	ABSTRACT. Galvao G. da S., Flausino W. & Lopes C.W.G. [Frequency of antibodies anti-Neospora caninum in water buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) in the State of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil]. Anticorpos anti-Neospora caninum em bufalos (Bubalus bubalis) no estado do Rio de Janeiro, Brasil. Revista Brasileira de Medicina Veterinaria, 35 (Supl.2):13-16, 2013. Curso de Pos-Graduacao em Ciencias Veterinarias, Instituto de Veterinaria, Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro, Campus Seropedica, BR 465 Km 7, Seropedica, 23897-970, RJ, Brasil.E-mail: galvaovet@gmail.com This study aimed to determine the presence of antibodies against Neospora caninum and the distribution among the different age groups in water buffaloes herds located in the mesoregions that comprise the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The frequency of seropositive animals in herds was 29.76% (86/ 289). Antibodies against N. caninum was detected in 14 (87.5%) of 16 properties, with positive ranging from 3.57 to 100%. Of the 298 animals examined, only 270 water buffaloes could be categorized into four age groups: ≤ 2 years, 2 to ≤ 4 years, 5-6 years and> 6 years, were subjected to indirect fluorescence antibody test (IFAT), with a cutoff of 1:200, thus presenting 27.41 % of seropositive animals (74/ 270). The Fisher exact test was used with a significance level of 5%. In the present study we observed differences in seropositivity according to different ages (p = 0.027), and animals aged more than five years had 2.62 further chances of exposure.The results show the exposure of water buffaloes to N. caninum in the regions studied, and should include the parasite in the differential diagnosis of possible cases of water buffaloes abortion, and revel the need to adopt health measures for the control of infection in water buffaloes herds.
2943197757	Positive canine parvovirus (CPV) faecal test results have been reported in dogs after modified live virus (MLV) vaccination. Thus, the aim was to investigate feline panleucopenia virus (FPV) shedding in recently vaccinated, adult, clinically healthy cats and to assess related factors. Forty cats were vaccinated with an FPV MLV vaccine. Faeces of cats were tested for presence of parvovirus DNA on days 7, 14, 21 and 28 by quantitative real-time PCR; DNA-positive samples were subjected to partial VP2 gene sequencing. Virus isolation was performed whenever sufficient amounts of faeces were available. Serum antibody titres were measured by haemagglutination inhibition on days 0, 7 and 28. Overall, 30.0 per cent (12/40; 95% CI 18.0 to 45.6) of cats shed parvovirus DNA. Sequencing revealed FPV vaccine virus DNA in three cats, FPV field virus DNA in four cats and CPV field virus DNA in one cat. Shedding was significantly associated with lack of prevaccination antibody titres (40) (P=0.016; OR: 6.44; 95% CI 1.44 to 28.89) and with postvaccination titre increases (fourfold) (P=0.029; OR: 5.00; 95% CI 1.17 to 21.39). Shedding of field or vaccine virus DNA seems to be common in healthy cats which can be a concern in shelters and catteries. Diagnostic tools should be developed to facilitate differentiation of vaccine and field virus shedding.
2055237918	A rigid shell of peptidoglycan encases and shapes bacteria and is constructed and maintained by a diverse set of enzymes, among which are the penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). Although a great deal has been learned about how these proteins synthesize and modify peptidoglycan, the physiological functions of the multitude of bacterial PBPs remain enigmatic. We approached this problem by combining PBP mutations in a comprehensive manner and screening for effects on biochemical processes involving the passage of proteins or nucleic acids across the cell wall. The results indicate that the PBPs or their peptidoglycan product do have significant biological functions, including roles in determination of cell shape, in phage resistance, in induction of capsule synthesis, and in regulation of autolysis.
2055237949	Abstract: I studied the reproduction and the population turnover of a succineid land snail living by a small lake in central Maryland. The identity of the snail, deduced from its external characteristics and the genitalia, comes closest to Oxyloma retusum (Lea, 1834). The species has a semelparous life cycle. The snails that survive the winter grow and reproduce from late March until the end of June when they reach their maximum size and die off. Their offspring (the spring generation) grow throughout the spring and the summer and reproduce briefly near the end of August. In the fall, the survivors from the spring generation and their offspring hibernate from November until the end of March. Snails mate by shell-mounting. In 89% of pairs, mating was anatomically reciprocal. During courtship, one snail climbs on the shell of a prospective mate and circles the shell to initiate mating. In mating pairs with a shell length difference of more than 1 mm, the smaller snail was always on top. This suggests that o...
2055238030	. The effect of peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) of carp, Cyprinus carpio L., was investigated on the regression of papilloma which had been induced in carp experimentally infected with Herpesvirus cyprini (CHV). The regression of the papilloma was delayed in carp injected with anti-carp PBL serum. In addition, the spontaneous cytotoxic activity of PBL derived from normal carp was suppressed by injection with anti-carp PBL serum. These results suggest that the spontaneous cytotoxic activity of carp PBL plays an important role in the regression of carp papilloma.
2055238094	Expression of the oncoprotein Qin induces tumors in chickens and oncogenic transformation of chicken embryo fibroblasts in culture. We performed a detailed deletion analysis of the C-terminal region of Qin (amino acids 246-451, extending from the winged helix domain to the C-terminus) and identified amino acids 246-379 as important for transformation. The same region mediates homo-oligomerization of Qin as documented in vitro by GST pulldowns and in vivo by coimmunoprecipitation. A 60 amino-acid region within the oligomerization domain is necessary and sufficient for transcriptional repression induced by Qin.
2055238172	Nearctic mites of the family Anisitsiellidae are reviewed. A key and revised diagnoses are presented for the four genera, keys to species are provided for the first time, and distributional data are reviewed for each of the 13 known species. Three original species groups of Bandakia are proposed based on knowledge of nearctic species, but with the four exotic species tentatively placed. Adults of four new nearctic species, Bandakia borealis n. sp., Bandakia oregonensis n. sp., Bandakia fragilis n. sp., and Bandakiopsis fonticola n. gen., n. sp., are described. Reared larvae of Bandakia vietsi Cook and Bandakia borealis n. sp., the first known anisitsiellid larvae, also are described providing new insight on life history and phylogeny in the Anisitsiellidae.
2055238218	Abstract Natural selection of two new variants of citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) was detected by observing tissues displaying both severe and mild symptoms from a single Gynura aurantiaca. The variants CEVd-S (severe) and CEVd-M (mild), differing by only five nucleotides confined to the pathogenic (P) domain, remained stable when propagated by rooted cuttings or from successive plants inoculated with tissue extracts or transcripts from cDNA clones. CEVd-S induces a very severe reaction in Gynura that is consistent throughout a range of environmental conditions. However, symptoms resulting from CEVd-M infection can vary from a nonsymptomatic condition to a severe reaction when grown at 40°C. This differential response was confined to a single host, Gynura aurantiaca, and expressed under standard growing conditions. The distinct host responses induced by these variants could not be correlated with any changes in sequence or conformation of the dominant viroid variant, as predicted by molecular modeling. Therefore, the variable symptom expression appears to be associated with a specific temperature-sensitive response of Gynura aurantiaca.
2055238225	We report here on developmental changes in [3H]RU 28362 (glucocorticoid receptor) and [3H]aldosterone (mineralocorticoid receptor) binding capacity in soluble fractions prepared from hippocampal tissue. [3H]RU 28362 binding was low on Day 3 of life (<30% of that observed in adults) and increased towards adult values during the second and third weeks of life, a pattern virtually identical to that previously reported for dexamethasone binding. In contrast, [3H]aldosterone binding on Day 3 of life was only slightly lower than that observed in adults and reached adult values by Day 7. Postnatal handling of rat pups, which has been shown to increase dexamethasone binding in hippocampus, resulted in a significant increase in [3H]RU 28362 binding capacity in hippocampus, but had no effect on [3H] aldosteronebinding.
2055238236	Exposure of seedlings of a chilling-sensitive variety of rice (Oryza sativa L. cv. Wasetoittu) to water stress (0.5 M mannitol, 30 min) at room temperature induced a degree of chilling resistance. No such resistance was induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) application (10 microM, 60 min). Upon short-term water stress, new transcripts were expressed in both seedlings and suspension-cultured cells. We suggest that the genes induced by short-term water stress, and not those induced by ABA, are related to acquired chilling resistance in this chilling-sensitive rice variety. A total of nine different cDNA clones, specifically induced by short-term water stress, were isolated by differential hybridization and partial sequencing. Northern hybridization analysis using RNAs from the seedlings subjected to chilling after water stress treatment reveal three distinct groups of above mentioned nine cDNA clones: wsi (water stress-induced) 18, 76, and 724, representative of genes whose expression increases, decreases, and remains almost fixed during chilling, respectively. The nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences of the three representative clones were determined. Characteristic features of wsi18 are the presence of one set of amino acid sequence repeats, a conserved amino acid sequence common to LEA-group genes in the N-terminal region, and an alanine- and lysine-rich tract in the C-terminal region.

2055238380	Follicular lymphomas (FL) are morphologically classified into grades 1, 2, 3a and 3b by the World Health Organization. Bcl2, Bcl6 and CD10 are phenotypic markers of FL while the Bcl2 t(14;18) and Bcl6 t(3q27) gene translocations are common genetic changes. However, to date, there has been no integrated analysis based on phenotype, grade and genotype from large numbers of FL cases. We graded 261 cases of FL and determined their phenotypes and gene alterations. According to the antigen markers and gene alterations of 147 cases, we classified FL into typical and the others types. The typical group, which includes 69% cases of FL, is characterized by low histological grade (grade 1, 2), coexpression of BCL2 and CD10 and Bcl2 gene translocation. The rest comprises a small part of low-grade FL without Bcl2 gene translocation and high-grade (grade 3a, 3b) FL. These FLs include some heterogeneous disease entities. They are characterized by high histological grade (87%), no definite expression of BCL2 or CD10 and several kinds of gene aberrances including Bcl2 translocation, Bcl6 translocation, Bcl2 amplification or other unknown gene abnormality. Our findings indicate that typical FL presents a homogeneous disease entity whereas the rest comprises heterogeneous diseases entities.
2055238440	The purpose of this study was to estimate genetic parameters for productive traits in swine. Productive traits were considered on average daily gain (ADG), body height (BH) and body length (BL). Genetic analysis was consisted of 18,668 heads for productive traits which were based on on-farm performance tested from May, 2007 to Apr, 2011. For estimating genetic parameters on productive traits, single best model was fitted after finding source of variance on fixed and random effects and estimated with a multiple trait animal model by using DF-REML (Derivative-Free Restricted Maximum Likelihood). The estimated heritabilities of Duroc, Berkshire, Landrace and Yorkshire 0.22~0.58 for the average daily gain, 0.34~0.41 for the body height and 0.4~0.52 for the body length, respectively. Phenotypic correlations of average daily gain with body height and body length for the four breeds were 0.42~0.48, 0.53~0.58, 0.34~0.46 and 0.47~0.56, respectively. Phenotypic correlations of body height with body length were 0.41, 0.57, 0.52, 0.59, respectively. The estimated genetic correlation coefficients of average daily gain with body height and body length estimated for the four breeds were 0.34~0.47, 0.70~0.75, 0.17~0.38 and 0.50~0.53, respectively. The estimated genetic correlation coefficients of body height with body length were 0.57, 0.69, 0.61 and 0.71, respectively.

2055238443	The migration of Schwann cells and their early association with axons were studied in transparent tadpole tail fins. Nomarksi optics revealed that in vivo these cells are pleomorphic, changing their shape by extending and withdrawing long, blunt pseudopods. Daily observations of the same fiber fascicles for a month or more combined with intensive short-term studies of other tadpoles showed that migrating Schwann cells move sporadically at rates of up to 114 μm/day. They are usually, although not always, in contact with one or more axons. In the electron microscope, these migrating cells are similar in cytoplasmic structure to others that have settled down and begun to spread along axons; however, they possess no basal lamina. Later, Schwann cells become more spindle-shaped and acquire a basal lamina. Schwann cell surface characteristics and the changes imposed by the presence of the basal lamina may be important in the establishment of permanent axon-Schwann cell relationships. In our living material we were unable to visualize the intricate, rapidly changing associations between Schwann cells and small axonal fascicles that precede myelination. However, they are probably more complex than Speidel's studies would indicate.
3139608564	Fifteen caprellid species in 5 genera were identifice during the study period from February to July , 1987 at 16 localites in Cheju Island and adjacent waters. Of which 5 species in 5 genera are newly reported from Korea ; Caprella kominatoensis Takeuchi, 1986. Protomima imittrix Mayer, 1903. Pseudoproto fallax Mayer, 1903, Paraprotella prima Mayer, 1903 and Protella gracilis Dana, 1853
2055238501	. Five winged forms of the black bean aphid, Aphis fabae, were subjected to 30 min of free flight in a recently designed, automated wind tunnel (David & Hardie, 1988). A circular green target, on the side of the chamber, was illuminated for 2.5 s of each minute of flight. Half of the fundatrigeniae (‘spring migrants’) and all of the virginoparous ‘summer migrants’ responded by flying towards the illuminated target while gynoparae (‘autumn migrants’) induced by short days over two generations in uncrowded conditions were unresponsive. 27% of generation 1 gynoparae, induced by crowded conditions and short days over one generation, responded to the target as did 50% of males.    Anaesthetization of adult gynoparae with nitrogen and carbon dioxide, but not ether, induced targeted flights. However, the effect of carbon dioxide was transient over the first 10 min whereas the effect of nitrogen continued throughout the 30-min experimental period. In addition, treatment of late fourth instar larvae, but not young adults, with Juvenile Hormone I provoked target responses. The results are discussed with reference to settling behaviour and the endocrine control of polyphenism.
2055238593	The extent and nature of epistatic interactions between mutations are issues of fundamental importance in evolutionary biology. However, they are difficult to study and their influence on adaptation remains poorly understood. Here, we use a systems-level approach to examine epistatic interactions that arose during the evolution of Escherichia coli in a defined environment. We used expression arrays to compare the effect on global patterns of gene expression of deleting a central regulatory gene, crp. Effects were measured in two lineages that had independently evolved for 20,000 generations and in their common ancestor. We found that deleting crp had a much more dramatic effect on the expression profile of the two evolved lines than on the ancestor. Because the sequence of the crp gene was unchanged during evolution, these differences indicate epistatic interactions between crp and mutations at other loci that accumulated during evolution. Moreover, a striking degree of parallelism was observed between the two independently evolved lines; 115 genes that were not crp-dependent in the ancestor became dependent on crp in both evolved lines. An analysis of changes in crp dependence of well-characterized regulons identified a number of regulatory genes as candidates for harboring beneficial mutations that could account for these parallel expression changes. Mutations within three of these genes have previously been found and shown to contribute to fitness. Overall, these findings indicate that epistasis has been important in the adaptive evolution of these lines, and they provide new insight into the types of genetic changes through which epistasis can evolve. More generally, we demonstrate that expression profiles can be profitably used to investigate epistatic interactions.
2055238617	Abstract Recent compelling data show that reactive oxygen species (ROS) not only are a harmful by-product of aerobic metabolism, but also are used as signaling molecules to regulate various cellular processes. In mammalian cells, ROS are produced transiently in response to many extracellular stimuli, including insulin, and specific inhibition of the ROS suppresses insulin-dependent signaling. Initially, this finding rationalized the concept of ROS acting as insulin mimetics. However, it is becoming evident that ROS are also causal to diabetes, a metabolic disorder characterized by insufficiency of secretion of, or receptor insensitivity to, endogenous insulin. This notion underlines a dual role for ROS in insulin signaling as both deleterious and beneficiary. Moreover, it strongly suggests that a delicate redox balance is required for insulin signaling to remain “healthy” for an organism. Antioxid. Redox Signal. 15, 219–232.
2055238647	We conducted a randomized clinical trial in 45 patients with resected AJCC stage IIB-IV melanoma to characterize cellular and molecular events at sites of immunization with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (IFA) alone, or a melanoma vaccine in IFA. At a primary vaccine site, all patients received a multi-peptide melanoma vaccine in IFA. At a replicate vaccine site, which was biopsied, group 1 received IFA only; group 2 received vaccine in IFA. Lymphocytes isolated from replicate vaccine site microenvironments (VSME) were compared to time-matched peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in ELISpot and flow cytometry assays. Compared to PBMC, the VSME had fewer naive and greater proportions of effector memory CD8+ T cells (TCD8). The vast majority of TCD8 within the VSME were activated (CD69+), with a concentration of antigen-specific (tetramerpos) cells in the VSME, particularly in vaccine sites with peptide (group 2). CXCR3+ lymphocytes were concentrated in the VSME of all patients, suggesting IFA-induced chemokine recruitment. TCD8 expression of retention integrins αEβ7 and α1β1 was elevated in VSME, with the highest levels observed in antigen-specific cells in VSME containing peptide (group 2). TCD8 retained in the VSME of both groups were strikingly dysfunctional, with minimal IFN-γ production in response to peptide stimulation and few tetramerpos cells producing IFN-γ. These data suggest that vaccine-induced selective retention and dysfunction of antigen-specific TCD8 within VSME may represent a significant mechanism underlying transient immune responses and low clinical response rates to peptide vaccines administered in IFA.
2055238661	This study tests the hypothesis that vertical habitat preferences of different monkey species inhabiting closed canopy rainforest are reflected in oxygen isotopes. We sampled bone from seven sympatric cercopithecid species in the Tai forest, Cote d'Ivoire, where long-term study has established taxon-specific patterns of habitat use and diet. Modern rib samples (n = 34) were examined for oxygen (δ18Oap) and carbon (δ13Cap) from bone apatite (‘bioapatite’), and carbon (δ13Cco) and nitrogen (δ15Nco) from bone collagen. Results are consistent for C3 feeders in a closed canopy habitat. Low irradiance and evapotranspiration, coupled with high relative humidity and recycled CO2 in forest understory, contribute to observed isotopic variability. Both δ13Cco and δ13Cap results reflect diet; however, δ13C values are not correlated with species preference for canopy height. By contrast, δ18Oap results are correlated with mean observed height and show significant vertical partitioning between taxa feeding at ground, lower and upper canopy levels. This oxygen isotope canopy effect has important palaeobiological implications for reconstructing vertical partitioning among sympatric primates and other species in tropical forests.
2055238681	By drawing a parallel with microbial systems it is possible to envisage a scheme of intracistronic recombinations which could give rise to new self-incompatibility alleles.
2055238688	Glycosylphosphatidylinositol precursor-analogues were synthesized in which the natural diacylglycerol lipid was replaced with either of two steroidal moieties. The ability of the steroidal glycosylphosphatidylinositol precursor-analogues to prime the glycosylphosphatidylinositol biosynthetic pathway was assessed in a trypanosomal cell-free system. The N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylase was only able to act upon the N-acetylglucosamine form of one of the two analogues. However, the glucosamine form of both analogues could be mannosylated, but neither were inositol-acylated nor modified with ethanolamine phosphate. The use of alternative groups, such as sterols, in place of the natural diacylglycerol lipid may enable the production of more drug-like, substrate-based inhibitors.
2055238715	Identification and quantification of tomato yield loss components The components of loss in tomato production were identified and quantified, in the summer-autumn period. The critial component and the key factor in the cultivation loss become evident using the methodology of the crop life table. The experiment was conducted at the Universidade Federal de Vicosa, Minas Gerais State, Brazil, from January to June 2001 and consisted of two treatments (cultivars Santa Clara and F1 Debora Plus) in a randomized complete block design with 5 replications. During the tomato cycle, the number of dead plants, the causes of this and the number of flowers and fruits/ plant were evaluated. At harvest, the healthy fruits were counted, weighted and classified; the causes of fruit damage were identified and the loss quantified. Total loss was more influenced by the fluctuation of the component plants (r=0,89) (P<0,01) than by other production components; consequently, plants were considered the critical production components of tomato. TSWV virus was the only factor affecting plant death, being considered the key-factor in the loss of this tomato production.
2055238734	Abstract Benign Theileria species in cattle, Theileria sergenti and T. buffeli, are morphologically indistinguishable. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify the genes encoding the 33- and 34-kDa major piroplasm antigens (p33/34) of T. sergenti and T. buffeli from cattle blood infected with these parasites and tick salivary gland infected with T. sergenti. Following amplification, the p33 gene from T. sergenti and the p34 gene from T. buffeli were clearly differentiated using the restriction enzyme sites that were not shared between them. The oligonucleotide primer set, designed from the p33/34 genes, was specific for these Theileria species, since no amplification was detected with DNA from Babesia ovata, B. bovis, Anaplasma marginale, A. centrale, Eperythrozoon wenyoni, bovine white blood cells, and uninfected tick salivary glands. One tenth vol of the template prepared from either 25 μl of blood with 0.5% parasitemia or individual tick salivary glands with six infected acini allowed sufficient amplification for differentiation of the two parasite species by restriction enzyme digestion. In addition, this system could be used to demonstrate the simultaneous, experimentally induced infection of cattle with T. sergenti and T. buffeli. The PCR-based marker system therefore provides a means to differentiate T. sergenti from T. buffeli in infected cattle blood and infected tick salivary glands. This system may also be useful for the characterization of other benign Theileria species in cattle.
2055238753	Damage to central nervous system white matter is observed following hypoglycemia, raising the possibility that hypoglycemia influences oligodendrocytes and myelination. To examine effects of hypoglycemia on oligodendrocytes and myelin formation, we studied cultured oligodendrocyte precursor cells and cerebellar slice cultures. We observed that with decreasing concentrations of glucose, oligodendrocyte precursor cell proliferation, maturation, and migration decreased. We also observed that hypoglycemia induced apoptotic cell death and activation of caspase-3 in oligodendrocyte precursor cells. Slice culture studies showed that glucose is required for myelinated fiber formation, as with reduction in the glucose concentration, the density of myelinated fibers decreased. Collectively, these data show that hypoglycemia inhibits oligodendrocyte development and myelination and that hypoglycemia triggers apoptotic cell death in oligodendrocyte precursor cells.
2055238775	Fall-grown tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea, Schreb.) provides a relatively inexpensive forage for winter grazing. Quality and yield of actively growing tall fescue increases when accumulated from August and harvested through time in the early fall. The effect of regrowth age on fall accumulated tall fescue quality has not been evaluated under similar harvest climates and animal performance on summer grown tall fescue is often low. Therefore a series of experiments were conducted to evaluate the in vivo quality of tall fescue in summer, alone and in combination with a legume, and to evaluate the in vivo quality of tall fescue of different regrowth ages harvested in December. Summer grown tall fescue, alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and red clover (Trifolium patense L.) were fed alone and compared with 50:50 mixes of each legume with tall fescue. Orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata L.) was also fed alone and with red clover during 1 year. Low in vivo digestible dry matter (DDM) of 35.8% for tall fescue 60 days old in 1975 was associated with droughtimposed dormancy. Nondormant, 40-day-old alfalfa regrowth was highly digestible (59.4% DDM). In 1976, the digestibilities of tall fescue and red clover were similar (54.8 and 53.9% DDM) and lower than that of orchardgrass (57.0% DDM). Consistent, nonsignificant trends in increased digestibility occurred with the inclusion of a legume which were sufficiently large to have potential economic consequences on animal production. In another experiment, tall fescue was accumulated from mid-June, July, August, and September, with 112 kg N/ha applied in mid-August, to evaluate the influence of age on in vivo quality when fed to sheep in early December. Quality decreased with increasing age. In 1975, June accumulated forage was significantly lower in quality than forage with shorter accumulation periods. In 1976, quality decreased with increased ages of the accumulated growth, ranging from 51.0 to 60.5% DDM for June and August accumulated forage, respectively. Quality of September accumulated forage was low (52.8% DDM), apparently due to high lignin and insoluble ash contents. Improved quality with shorter accumulation periods was offset by lower dry matter yields (5.2 vs. 2.2 metric tons/ha) and DDM yields were also reduced (1.7 vs. 1.2 metric tons/ha) from June to September, respectively. Accumulating tall fescue from as early as mid July did not decrease digestibility or intake sufficiently to make this practice impractical for winter grazing. Summer utilized tall fescue was lower in quality than that utilized in winter. There were significant correlations between DDM and TNC contents.
2055238787	Mutations in the zebrafish nacre/mitfa gene, expressed in all embryonic melanogenic cells, perturb only neural crest melanocytes, suggesting redundancy of mitfa with another gene in the zebrafish retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). Here, we describe a second zebrafish mitf gene, mitfb, which may fulfill this role. The proteins encoded by the two zebrafish mitf genes appear homologous to distinct isoforms generated by alternately spliced mRNAs of the single mammalian Mitf gene, suggesting specialization of the two zebrafish genes following a duplication event. Consistent with this hypothesis, expression of mitfa and mitfb is partially overlapping. mitfb is coexpressed with mitfa in the RPE at an appropriate time to compensate for loss of mitfa function in the nacre mutant but is not expressed in neural crest melanoblasts. Additionally, mitfb is expressed in the epiphysis and olfactory bulb where mitfa is not, and where Mitf expression has not previously been reported in other species. mitfb, but not a zebrafish ortholog of the closely related gene tfe3, can rescue neural crest melanophore development in nacre/mitfa mutant embryos when expressed via the mitfa promoter. These data suggest that mitfa and mitfb together may recapitulate the expression and functions of a single ancestral Mitf gene, and that mitfb may serve additional novel functions.
2055238793	Whole mitochondrial DNA of the Silkie fowl (Gallus gallus var. domesticus) was sequenced in order to elucidate the genetic position of the Silkie fowl in its related species based on mitochondrial DNA sequence. The length of Silkie mitochondrial DNA was found to be 16,784 base pairs. The similarity between Silkie and White Leghorn was found to be 99.77% (39 nucleotide differences in 16,784 base pairs). Since the sequences of NADH dehydrogenase subunit 2 and cytochrome b genes have been reported in six species [Japanese quail : Coturnix japonica, Ring-neck pheasant : Phasianus colchicus, Grey partridge : Perdix perdix, Chinese bamboo partridge : Bambusicola thoracia, Chicken (White Leghorn) : Gallus gallus var. domesticus, and Redhead : Aythya americana], nucleotide sequences of these two genes were used for a phylogenetic analysis of Silkie against these six species using neighbor joining and maximum likelihood methods. The Silkie and White Leghorn are in the same phylogenetic cluster with a bootstrap value of 1000/1000.
2055238860	Background  Fungal extracellular vesicles are able to cross the cell wall and transport molecules that help in nutrient acquisition, cell defense, and modulation of the host defense machinery.   Methodology/Principal Findings  Here we present a detailed lipidomic analysis of extracellular vesicles released by Paracoccidioides brasiliensis at the yeast pathogenic phase. We compared data of two representative isolates, Pb3 and Pb18, which have distinct virulence profiles and phylogenetic background. Vesicle lipids were fractionated into different classes and analyzed by either electrospray ionization- or gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. We found two species of monohexosylceramide and 33 phospholipid species, including phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidic acid, phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, and phosphatidylglycerol. Among the phospholipid-bound fatty acids in extracellular vesicles, C181 predominated in Pb3, whereas C18:2 prevailed in Pb18. The prevalent sterol in Pb3 and Pb18 vesicles was brassicasterol, followed by ergosterol and lanosterol. Inter-isolate differences in sterol composition were observed, and also between extracellular vesicles and whole cells.   Conclusions/Significance  The extensive lipidomic analysis of extracellular vesicles from two P. brasiliensis isolates will help to understand the composition of these fungal components/organelles and will hopefully be useful to study their biogenesis and role in host-pathogen interactions.
2055238894	Single and double-label immunofluorescence were used to study the fibronectin (FN) and keratins (Ks) localization patterns in early wounded confluent PtK2 cells. A time-course study (0 hr, 2 hr, 6 hr and 24 hr) gives the following results: before wounding, the FN localizations of confluent cells are composed of curved and sometimes branched strands or fibrils. The Ks network is formed by radial fluorescent filaments connecting the Ks centers near the nuclei with a linear fluorescence underlying the cell membrane. Two hr after, the FN localizations are redistributed at the cell-cell contact areas. The radial Ks filaments are compacted around the nuclei, some of them delineate the cytoplasmic periphery of the wounded cells. Six hr later, the method shows redistributed FN localizations at the cell-cell contact areas. An alveolar pattern is formed enclosing each of the adjacent cells. The codetected Ks filaments are retracted around the nuclei. The underlying cell-cell contact areas are also well demonstrated. It may be noted that these areas are FN-labelled. Twenty-four hr after wounding, the FN alveolar pattern persists. The redistributed Ks filaments have some similarity to those seen before wounding.
2055238927	Surveillance for avian influenza viruses in wild birds was initiated in Canada in 2005. In 2006, in order to maximize detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, the sampling protocol used in Canada's Inter-agency Wild Bird Influenza Survey was changed. Instead of collecting a single cloacal swab, as previously done in 2005, cloacal and oropharyngeal swabs were combined in a single vial at collection. In order to compare the two sampling methods, duplicate samples were collected from 798 wild dabbling ducks (tribe Anatini) in Canada between 24 July and 7 September 2006. Low pathogenic avian influenza viruses were detected significantly more often (P<0.0001) in combined oropharyngeal and cloacal samples (261/798, 33%) than in cloacal swabs alone (205/798, 26%). Compared to traditional single cloacal samples, combined samples improved virus detection at minimal additional cost.
2055238938	Long non-coding (lnc) RNAs serve a multitude of functions in cells. NEAT1 RNA is a highly abundant 4 kb lncRNA in nuclei, and coincides with paraspeckles, nuclear domains that control sequestration of paraspeckle proteins. We examined NEAT1 RNA levels and its function in 3T3-L1 cells during differentiation to adipocytes. Levels of NEAT1 transcript, measured by RT-PCR, fluctuated in a temporal manner over the course of differentiation that suggested its role in alternative splicing of PPARγ mRNA, the major transcription factor driving adipogenesis. When cells were induced to differentiate by a media cocktail of insulin, dexamethasone, and isobutylmethyxanthine (IBMX) on Day 0, NEAT1 levels dropped on Day 4, when the PPARγ2 variant was spliced and when terminal differentiation occurs The appearance of PPARγ2 coordinates with the PPARγ1 variant to drive differentiation of adipocytes. SiRNA used to deplete NEAT1 resulted in the inability of cells to phosphorylate the serine/arginine-rich splicing protein, SRp40. SiRNA treatment for SRp40 resulted in dysregulation of PPARγ1 and, primarily, PPARγ2 mRNA levels. SRp40 associated with NEAT1, as shown by RNA-IP on days 0 and 8, but decreased on day 4, and concentrations increased over that of IgG control. Overexpression of SRp40 increased PPARγ2, but not γ1. Although lncRNA MALAT1 has been investigated in SR protein function, NEAT1 has not been shown to bind SR proteins for phosphorylation such that alternative splicing results. The ability of cells to increase phosphorylated SR proteins for PPARγ2 splicing suggests that fluxes in NEAT1 levels during adipogenesis regulate alternative splicing events.
2943197914	Two new species of genus Fibuloides, F. bacriora Siraphattarathamrong and Pinkaew, n. sp., and F. falcatus Siraphattarathamrong and Pinkaew, n. sp., are described from Thailand. Adults and genitalia are illustrated. The two new taxa increase the number of described Fibuloides species in Thailand to 17.
2943197970	Mutations in the retinoblastoma (RB) tumour suppressor pathway are a hallmark of cancer and a prevalent feature of lung adenocarcinoma1–3. Although RB was the first tumour suppressor to be identified, the molecular and cellular basis that underlies selection for persistent RB loss in cancer remains unclear4–6. Methods that reactivate the RB pathway using inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases CDK4 and CDK6 are effective in some cancer types and are currently under evaluation for the treatment of lung adenocarcinoma7–9. Whether RB pathway reactivation will have therapeutic effects and whether targeting CDK4 and CDK6 is sufficient to reactivate RB pathway activity in lung cancer remains unknown. Here we model RB loss during lung adenocarcinoma progression and pathway reactivation in established oncogenic KRAS-driven tumours in mice. We show that RB loss enables cancer cells to bypass two distinct barriers during tumour progression. First, RB loss abrogates the requirement for amplification of the MAPK signal during malignant progression. We identify CDK2-dependent phosphorylation of RB as an effector of MAPK signalling and critical mediator of resistance to inhibition of CDK4 and CDK6. Second, RB inactivation deregulates the expression of cell-state-determining factors, facilitates lineage infidelity and accelerates the acquisition of metastatic competency. By contrast, reactivation of RB reprograms advanced tumours towards a less metastatic cell state, but is nevertheless unable to halt cancer cell proliferation and tumour growth due to adaptive rewiring of MAPK pathway signalling, which restores a CDK-dependent suppression of RB. Our study demonstrates the power of reversible gene perturbation approaches to identify molecular mechanisms of tumour progression, causal relationships between genes and the tumour suppressive programs that they control and critical determinants of successful cancer therapy. Loss of RB promotes both malignant progression and the development of metastatic disease; however, whereas reactivation of the RB pathway can revert metastatic tumour cell states to non-metastatic cell states, malignant cell proliferation is supported by MAPK–CDK2-dependent suppression of RB.
2943198381	Petragenol is an attractant contained methyl-eugenol. It is an insect’s pheromone signaling for mating, made colony, and feeding. The oranges had too an attractants especially for fruit flies. The aim of this research was to know the influence of combination of oranges extract and petragenol to Feeding Strategy of  Bactrocera dorsalis  flies. This research used the Y tube method. The 60 fruit flies were used as samples. The 10 flies were placed in start chamber Y tube and in two other tips were placed the bait as a single or combinations of non-matured oranges extract and petragenol (A), matured oranges extract and petragenol (B), decay-oranges extract and petragenol (C), and petragenol as control (D). Feeding Strategy defined by the need of time to reach the bait and the spend of time in the bait with categories as activity of Searching, Grounding, Gathering, and Learning. The data analyzed by Chi-square  (X 2 ).  The results showed that the fastest searching activity in B, the longest time to gathering activity in A, the longest time to grounding activity in non-matured oranges extract, and the longest time to learning activity in matured oranges extract. It can conlude that the best attractant to teas  Bactrocera dorsalis  Feeding Strategy are matured oranges extract-petragenol combination for Searching and Learning activity, and combination of non-matured oranges extract  and petragenol to grounding and gathering activity. Key words: petragenol, oranges extract, feeding strategy
2943198505	Global habitat fragmentation is associated with the emergence of infectious diseases of wildlife origins in human populations. Despite this well-accepted narrative, the underlying mechanisms driving this association remain unclear. We introduce a nuanced hypothesis, the ‘coevolution effect’. The central concept is that the subdivision of host populations which occurs with habitat fragmentation causes localized coevolution of hosts, obligate parasites, and pathogens which act as ‘coevolutionary engines’ within each fragment, accelerating pathogen diversification, and increasing pathogen diversity across the landscape. When combined with a mechanism to exit a fragment (e.g., mosquitoes), pathogen variants will spill over into human communities. Through this combined ecoevolutionary approach we may be able to understand the fine-scale mechanisms that drive disease emergence in the Anthropocene.
2943198649	Tuberculosis is an airborne infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis which threatens the globe. Aminoglycosides {Amikacin (AK) & Kanamycin (KM)} are WHO recommended second-line anti-TB drugs used against the treatment of drug-resistant tuberculosis. Aminoglycosides target the steps of protein translation machinery of M.tuberculosis. Several mechanisms have been put forward to elucidate the phenomena of aminoglycosides resistance but our knowledge is still insufficient. The aim of the study was to understand the involvement of Mycobacterium tuberculosis universal stress protein (Rv2005c) in aminoglycosides resistance and virulence. To establish the relationship of universal stress protein Rv2005c with AK & KM resistance, Rv2005c was cloned, expressed in E.coli BL21 using pQE2 expression vector and antimicrobial drug susceptibility testing (DST) was carried out. STRING-10 was also used to predict the interacting protein partners of Rv2005c. DST showed that the minimum inhibitory concentration of induced recombinant cells (Rv2005c) were five and four folds shifted with AK and KM E-strips, respectively. STRING-10 showed the interacting protein partners of Rv2005c. Overexpression of Rv2005c leads to shifting in MIC which might be signifying its involvement in the survival/resistance of Mycobacteria by inhibiting/modulating the effects of AK and KM released from the E-strips. Interactome also suggests that Rv2005c and its interacting protein partners are cumulatively involved in M.tuberculosis resistance, stresses, and latency.
3139608675	Summary Natural cholinesterase inhibitors were found in many biological sources: bacteria, blue-greens, plants, marine sponges, microscopic fungus, and in a smaller scale also in mushrooms, fruiting body of macroscopis fungus. Only cholinesterase inhibitors isolated from mushrooms are subjects of this minireview. These natural compounds with anticholinergic activity may be considered as prospective drugs against Alzheimer's disease.
3149562843	The two moth species Heliothis virescens (Hv) and H. subflexa (Hs) are closely related, but have vastly different feeding habits. Hv is a generalist and an important pest in many crops in the USA, while Hs is a specialist feeding only on plants in the genus Physalis .I n this study, we conducted a comparative population genetic analysis to assess whether and how generalist and specialist life styles are reflected in differences in population structures. In Hv 98% of the total variation occurred within populations. The overall differentiation (FST) between regions was 0.006 and even lower between years (0.0039) and hosts (0.0028). Analyses of population structure suggest that all individuals form one genetically homogeneous population, except for at most 12 individuals (6%) that diverged from this cluster. Population homogeneity likely results from the high mobility of Hv and its generalist feeding behaviour. Hs exhibited substantially more population structure. Even though 96% of the total variation was attributable to within-population variability, FST-values between Hs populations were 10 times higher than between Hv populations. Hs populations showed significant isolation by distance. Analyses of Hs population structure suggest at least two subpopulations and thus some degree of metapopulation structure. We speculate that the patchy distribution of Physalis – the exclusive food source of Hs – contributes to differences in population structure between these closely related species. The finding that the specialist shows more population differentiation than the generalist corroborates the notion that host specialization is not an evolutionary dead end but a dynamic trait.
3149563061	The aim of the study is to find out the microRNAs that acted on classical swine fever virus(CSFV) in swine umbilical vein endothelial cells(SUVECs).CSFV 3′-and 5′-untranslated region(UTR) were cloned,and then were inserted into psiCHECHTM-2 plasmid that carrying Firefly and Renilla luciferases reporter genes;the microRNAs that acted with CSFV were forecasted through bio-informatics analysis;then the recombinant plasmids and inhibitors of predicted microRNA were co-transfected into SUVECs.The activity of Firefly and Renilla luciferases was detected by Luminometer.The PCR products of CSFV 5′-UTR(373 bp) and 3′-UTR(252 bp) were detected by 10 g·L-1 agarose electrophoresis consistent with predicted size,from which four predicted microRNAs(ssc-miR-let7c,ssc-miR-106a,ssc-miR-18,ssc-miR-139) were selected.The CSFV 3′-UTR is the important action site of microRNA in SUVECs.The four microRNAs mentioned above had different inhibitory effect on CSFV 3′-UTR,of which the ssc-miR-18 play a more important role.
2055238959	Soil in a potato field naturally infested with black dot (Colletotrichum coccodes) was fumigated with methyl bromide at 126 g m−2 or left unfumigated. Potato seed tubers (cv. BP1) uninfected, lightly infected (1–25% surface affected), severely infected (26–100% surface affected) and severely infected withC. coccodes but dusted with prochloraz manganese chloride as Octave 2.5% DP at 750 g per 100 kg seed were planted in fumigated and unfumigated soil. When harvested, the incidence of black dot on the progeny of infected seed planted in unfumigated soil was twice that of progeny in fumigated soil, with progeny of uninfected seed having a 68.5 times higher disease incidence in unfumigated soil. Black dot on progeny tubers was reduced by pre-treatment of seed with prochloraz in fumigated soil only. With black dot infested fields, planting disease-free seed or treating seed with fungicides would not decrease disease on progeny tubers.
2055238966	Abstract This study has examined the effect of diet-induced hypercholesterolemia on guinea pig platelets, erythrocytes, megakaryocytes and plasma. The cholesterol/phospholipid ratios of plasma and erythrocytes began to increase after one day on the diet and increased steadily for two weeks and more slowly thereafter until 30 days. In contrast, the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of platelets remained constant for 4–5 days, then increased until reaching a maximum of about 0.85 in two weeks. Thus, the time-course for increase of the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio is different for platelets than for erythrocytes and plasma. The increase in the cholesterol/phospholipid ratio of megakaryocytes was small and not dependent on the degree of increase in the plasma cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. The cholesterol esters of both platelets and megakaryocytes increased with time for two weeks. The increase in megakaryocyte cholesterol esters appeared to precede that of platelets. The protein content of platelets and megakaryocytes and average megakaryocyte size were increased. Normal platelets incubated in plasma from hypercholesterolemic guinea pigs did not accumulate excess cholesterol, but erythrocyte cholesterol increased 45% in 6 h under the same conditions. Cholesterol synthesis in megakaryocytes was depressed 50–80% by cholesterol feeding and by in vitro incubation of the cells in hypercholesterolemic plasma. The data suggest that the platelets and erythrocytes may accumulate excess cholesterol by different mechanisms. The effects of cholesterol feeding on megakaryocytes and the lag in accumulation of cholesterol in platelets relative to erythrocytes and plasma suggest that a defect in the megakaryocyte may be a primary determinant of accumulation of cholesterol in platelets.
2055238997	Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values are presented for faunal and human bone collagen from Baijia, in the Wei River valley region of Shaanxi Province, China. The remains have a calibrated age range of ca. 5709-5389 BC, and correspond with the early Neolithic Laoguantai Period. Stable isotopic results indicate that human diets included millet and probably aquatic foods such as fish and shellfish. Bovid samples are tentatively identified as water buffalo, and have a mean delta C-13 value of -14.6 parts per thousand, which reflects some millet consumption. Whether bovids were grazing on wild millet, or had diets directly influenced by humans, is not known. The single Sus sample from Baijia had a diet dominated by C3 plants and is thus unlikely to have been a domesticated animal. Overall, the stable isotope results presented here conform to the current concept that the people of the Laoguantai culture were millet farmers, who had subsistence strategies that included hunted wild foods.

2055239002	Abstract The Drosophila melanogaster diphenol oxidase (DOX) A2-encoding gene ( Dox-A2 ) is involved in catecholamine metabolism, melanin formation and sclerotization of the cuticle. Insect phenol oxidases (POX) are well studied biochemically, but not genetically and molecularly. The Dox-A2 (2–53.9) gene is the first insect POX-encoding gene to be cloned and sequenced. It encodes a protein product unique among currently known POX. The deduced protein, however, exhibits extensive similarity (58–81%) to the mouse mast cell tum − antigen, P91A [Lurquin et al., Cell 58 (1989) 293–303] and may identify the normal mouse protein as a DOX.
2055239052	Abstract The developing indirect flight muscles of pharate moths are characterized by a rhythmic discharge of a long bout of flight-pattern-like muscle potentials in the absence of contractions. The electrical activity of the dorsal longitudinal flight muscles (DLMs) in the silkmoth, Bombyx mori, was discernible as a cluster of many series of muscle potentials that last for several minutes on day 4 of the pupal period. The duration of the active phases and the period of rhythmic activity gradually increased to a peak value on day 7 or 8 and then declined until the end of the pupal period. Mean duration of the active phases (±SD) and the mean period of the rhythmic activity (±SD) at the peak were 38.7±8.7 min and 74.5±7.3 min, respectively. The rhythmic electrical activity of immature DLMs was closely coordinated with the rhythmic (bursting) activity of a population of neurosecretory cells that are known to produce pheromone-biosynthesis activating neuropeptide (PBAN) and its related peptides, which belong...
2055239122	Spinal and bulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA) is a neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the androgen receptor (AR). The N-terminal fragment of AR containing the expanded polyglutamine tract aggregates in cytoplasm and/or in nucleus and induces cell death. Some chaperones such as Hsp40 and Hsp70 have been identified as important regulators of polyglutamine aggregation and/or cell death in neuronal cells. Recently, Hsp105α, expressed at especially high levels in mammalian brain, has been shown to suppress apoptosis in neuronal cells and prevent the aggregation of protein caused by heat shock in vitro. However, its role in polyglutamine-mediated cell death and toxicity has not been studied. In the present study, we examined the effects of Hsp105α on the aggregation and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract using a cellular model of SBMA. The transient expression of truncated ARs (tARs) containing an expanded polyglutamine tract caused aggregates to form in COS-7 and SK-N-SH cells and concomitantly apoptosis in the cells with the nuclear aggregates. When Hsp105α was overexpressed with tAR97 in the cells, Hsp105α was colocalized to aggregates of tAR97, and the aggregation and cell toxicity caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract were markedly reduced. Both β-sheet and α-helix domains, but not the ATPase domain, of Hsp105α were necessary to suppress the formation of aggregates in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, Hsp105α was found to localize in nuclear inclusions formed by ARs containing an expanded polyglutamine tract in tissues of patients and transgenic mice with SBMA. These findings suggest that overexpression of Hsp105α suppresses cell death caused by expansion of the polyglutamine tract without chaperone activity, and the enhanced expression of the essential domains of Hsp105α in brain may provide an effective therapeutic approach for CAG repeat diseases.
2055239213	The locomotor activity pattern of the blind mole rat Spalax ehrenbergi was determined in its natural habitat by means of a radiotelemetric device. Twelve adult mole rats were fitted with radiotelemetric transmitters (9 during winter and 3 during summer) and tracked for 5 noncontinuous days during which air and soil temperatures were measured. Mole rats were found to have a diurnal monophasic locomotor activity pattern with activity peaks from 08:00 to 13:00 and from 11:00 to 19:00 during summer and winter, respectively. Activity periods were punctuated by several rest breaks and, conversely, rest periods were interrupted by short spells of activity. Duration of activity was 6.6 ± 0.4 h (mean ± SD) in summer and 7.9 ± 2.3 h in winter. In the laboratory, mole rats were found to entrain their activity, under constant dim light, to a single daily 20-s light pulse. Moreover, such a light pulse given only once every 3 days was found to provide a stimulus sufficient to entrain the mole rats' locomotor activity. ...
2055239244	Abstract Influenza virus RNA labeled with 32 PO 4 was annealed to viral complementary (messenger) RNA (cRNA) isolated from polysomes of infected cells. After purification, the hybrid molecules were examined by polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis. As early as 20 min after infection, all eight segments of virus-specific cRNA were associated with polysomes, indicating a lack of temporal control at the transcriptional level. Also, it was found that the addition of actinomycin D to cells 2 hr after infection stopped further cRNA synthesis but had no effect on preexisting cRNA.
2055239246	A new hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:putrescine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase (PHT) was detected in two variant lines of Nicotiana tabacum L. (TX1, TX4) accumulating markedly different levels of caffeoylputrescine. The enzyme accepted only the aliphatic diamines putrescine, cadaverine and 1,3-diaminopropane at a ratio of 100:33:8. Caffeoyl- and feruloyl-CoAs were the best acyl donors. The apparent K(m)-values for caffeoyl-CoA and putrescine were near 3 and 10 micromolar, respectively, at the pH-optimum of 10.0. PHT activity was quite similar in low producing TX1 and high producing TX4 cells, while some other biosynthetic enzymes (phenylalanine ammonia-lyase, ornithine decarboxylase) were greatly enhanced in TX4 cells, suggesting that PHT does not catalyze the rate-limiting step in hydroxycinnamoylputrescine formation.
2055239335	Abstract Intracellular recordings were used to characterize the physiological changes underlying decreases in excitation observed in striatal neurons during the aging process. Rats were divided into 3 age groups: young (3–5 months), middle-aged (10–12 months) and aged (>24 months). All experiments were performed in urethane-anesthetized rats. Recordings were obtained from 33 neurons in young, 17 in middle-aged and 20 in aged rats. When identified by intracellular injections of Lucifer yellow all recorded neurons were medium-sized spiny cells. Resting membrane potentials were at least −40 mV and action potentials greater than 35 mV. Postsynaptic responses were evoked by stimulation of frontal cortex. In all recorded neurons, regardless of age, excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) could be evoked. However, the threshold currents for eliciting both EPSPs and synaptically driven action potentials were significantly higher in neurons obtained from aged rats than those recorded in the other two groups. Other changes in excitation in aged striatal neurons consisted of absence of spontaneously occurring EPSPs, higher current to induce firing by intracellular injections of depolarizing current and an inability of orthodromically induced action potentials to follow paired stimulation pulses to the cortex at short interpulse intervals. These data were interpreted to indicate that a combination of changes in synaptic connectivity and in membrane properties underlie the decreases in excitation. Together with our previous findings obtained from aged cats these results indicate that decreased neuronal excitability is a major effect of aging in the striatum.
2055239372	MEMBERS of many ant species exchange fluid foods within the colony1–4. Similar exchange between social symbionts, living as “slaves”5 or “guests”6 and their hosts, is also documented1. However, in non-symbiotic species, found in the same habitat or in distinctly different habitats, this phenomenon is usually overlooked. We document here that the food-transporting worker ant of one species offered carbohydrate food to the aggressive worker ants of another as a means of suppressing aggression in the latter, as in appeasement displays in higher animals. The workers of the aggressive red fire ant species, Solenopsis invicta, introduced into the southern United States in the 1930s but comparatively recently named7, were invariably offered regurgitated fluids by indigenous species S. geminata and Pheidole dentata which had been fed earlier with 32P-labelled 20% sucrose solution.
2055239373	Realization of the full potential of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in regenerative medicine requires the development of well-defined culture conditions for their long-term growth and directed differentiation. Current practices for maintaining hPSCs generally utilize empirically determined combinations of feeder cells and other animal-based products, which are expensive, difficult to isolate, subject to batch-to-batch variations, and unsuitable for cell-based therapies. Using a high-throughput screening approach, we identified several polymers that can support self-renewal of hPSCs. While most of these polymers provide support for only a short period of time, we identified a synthetic polymer poly(methyl vinyl ether-alt-maleic anhydride) (PMVE-alt-MA) that supported the long-term attachment, proliferation and self-renewal of HUES1, HUES9, and iPSCs. The hPSCs cultured on PMVE-alt-MA maintained their characteristic morphology, expressed high levels of markers of pluripotency, and retained a normal karyotype. Such cost-effective, polymer-based matrices that support long-term self-renewal and proliferation of hPSCs will not only help to accelerate the translational perspectives of hPSCs, but also provide a platform to elucidate the underlying molecular mechanisms that regulate stem cell proliferation and differentiation.
2055239421	In Taiwan, Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection has been reported in foreign laborers who had consumed raw Ampullarium canaliculatus snails. This study analyzed three foreign laborers who had contracted enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay-confirmed A cantonensis infection while working in Taiwan. All three workers had consumed either roasted snails or raw snails flavored with seasoning while drinking wine. This study investigated possible risk factors for A cantonensis, including naturally occurring A cantonensis in A canaliculatus snails, viability of third-stage A cantonensis larvae in raw seasoned snails and in roasted snails, infectivity of larvae, and effects of alcohol while consuming snails. Positive infection rates in snails from five different irrigation canals in south Taiwan ranged from 12.3% to 29.4% and the average number of motile larvae per infected snail ranged from 36 to 65. The number of motile and coiled larvae in snail meat after 120 minutes seasoning was 93 (27.7%) and 233 (69.3%), respectively. After 20 minutes of roasting, most larvae in the snail meat were dead. The infectivities of motile and coiled larvae from snail meat after 60 minutes seasoning were 53.2% and 33.2%, respectively, and those from snail meat after 5 minutes roasting were 33.2% and 7.0%, respectively. Eating Taiwan A canaliculatus snails raw is extremely risky given their high infection rates and infection intensities. Even after 120 minutes seasoning or after 20 minutes roasting, snail meat should be considered unsafe for human consumption. Finally, experimental rodent studies indicated that consuming alcohol while ingesting larvae does not significantly reduced infectivity.

2943198986	Purpose Diabetes leads to the downregulation of the retinal Kir4.1 channels and Muller cell dysfunction. The insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) is a critical regulator of insulin signaling in Muller cells. Circadian rhythms play an integral role in normal physiology; however, diabetes leads to a circadian dysrhythmia. We hypothesize that diabetes will result in a circadian dysrhythmia of IRS-1 and Kir4.1 and disturbed clock gene function will have a critical role in regulating Kir4.1 channels. Methods We assessed a diurnal rhythm of retinal IRS-1 and Kir4.1 in db/db mice. The Kir4.1 function was evaluated using a whole-cell recording of Muller cells. The rat Muller cells (rMC-1) were used to undertake in vitro studies using a siRNA. Results The IRS-1 exhibited a diurnal rhythm in control mice; however, with diabetes, this natural rhythm was lost. The Kir4.1 levels peaked and troughed at times similar to the IRS-1 rhythm. The IRS-1 silencing in the rMC-1 led to a decrease in Kir4.1 and BMAL1. The insulin treatment of retinal explants upregulated Kir4.1 possibly via upregulation of BMAL1 and phosphorylation of IRS-1 and Akt-1. Conclusions Our studies highlight that IRS-1, by regulating BMAL1, is an important regulator of Kir4.1 in Muller cells and the dysfunctional signaling mediated by IRS-1 may be detrimental to Kir4.1.
2943199325	During embryo development, the vascular precursors and ground tissue stem cells divide to renew themselves and produce the vascular tissue, endodermal cells, and cortical cells. However, the molecular mechanisms regulating division of these stem cells have remained largely elusive. In this study, we show that loss of function of SOMATIC EMBRYOGENESIS RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE (SERK) genes results in aberrant embryo development. Fewer cortical, endodermal, and vascular cells are generated in the embryos of serk1 serk2 bak1 triple mutants. WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX 5 (WOX5) is ectopically expressed in vascular cells of serk1 serk2 bak1 embryos. The first transverse division of vascular precursors in mid-globular embryos and second asymmetric division of ground tissue stem cells in early-heart embryos are abnormally altered to a longitudinal division. The embryo defects can be partially rescued by constitutively activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) kinase kinase YODA (YDA) and MAPK kinase MKK5. Taken together, our results reveal that SERK-mediated signals regulate division patterns of vascular precursors and ground tissue stem cells, likely via the YDA-MKK4/5 cascade, during embryo development.
2943199409	Background Competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) are a newly identified type of regulatory RNA. Accumulating evidence suggests that ceRNAs play an important role in the pathogenesis of diseases such as cancer. Thus, ceRNA dysregulation may represent an important molecular mechanism underlying cancer progression and poor prognosis. In this study, we aimed to identify ceRNAs that may serve as potential biomarkers for early diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). Methods We performed differential gene expression analysis on TCGA-LUAD datasets to identify differentially expressed (DE) mRNAs, lncRNAs, and miRNAs at different tumor stages. Based on the ceRNA hypothesis and considering the synergistic or feedback regulation of ceRNAs, a lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA network was constructed. Functional analysis was performed using gene ontology term and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis and KOBAS 2.0 software. Transcription factor (TF) analysis was carried out to identify direct targets of the TFs associated with LUAD prognosis. Identified DE genes were validated using gene expression omnibus (GEO) datasets. Results Based on analysis of TCGA-LUAD datasets, we obtained 2,610 DE mRNAs, 915 lncRNAs, and 125 miRNAs that were common to different tumor stages (|log2(Fold change)| ≥ 1, false discovery rate < 0.01), respectively. Functional analysis showed that the aberrantly expressed mRNAs were closely related to tumor development. Survival analyses of the constructed ceRNA network modules demonstrated that five of them exhibit prognostic significance. The five ceRNA interaction modules contained one lncRNA (FENDRR), three mRNAs (EPAS1, FOXF1, and EDNRB), and four miRNAs (hsa-miR-148a, hsa-miR-195, hsa-miR-196b, and hsa-miR-301b). The aberrant expression of one lncRNA and three mRNAs was verified in the LUAD GEO dataset. Transcription factor analysis demonstrated that EPAS1 directly targeted 13 DE mRNAs. Conclusion Our observations indicate that lncRNA-related ceRNAs and TFs play an important role in LUAD. The present study provides novel insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying LUAD pathogenesis. Furthermore, our study facilitates the identification of potential biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prognosis of LUAD and therapeutic targets for its treatment.
2943199480	A comparative study of three mangrove forests was held in Piaui river estuary, south coast of Sergipe State, Brazil. The forests represented the following successional stages: initial (P), intermediate (P2) and advanced (P3). Plots of 500 m2 were set up in each forest, and all trees with DBH ≥ 1.59cm were sampled and measured. The differences between forests tree communities and its main populations were analyzed through mean tests, including several structures parameters. A linear regression analysis was applied to the main populations to test the occurrence of allometric patterns, and made inferences about their growth aspects. The results showed that the densities of individuals and richness of species decreased, while height, diameter and basal area of trees increased significantly according to successional stages. Species richness were higher in P1 (4 spp.), followed by P2 (2 spp.) and P3 (1 spp.). However, only Laguncularia racemosa (P1) and Rizophora mangle (P2 e P3) were the most important species in forest structures. Laguncularia racemosa tended to invest more in height growth in a mangrove initial stage, while R. mangle invested more in radial growth in a mangrove advanced stage. The studied forest mangroves in Piaui presented structural aspects similar to those founded throughout mangroves with similar ages along Northeastern and Southeastern coast of Brazil
2943199759	Picobirnaviruses (PBVs) have been characterized as opportunistic enteric pathogens detected in various domestic, zoo and wild animals, suggesting a wide host range of these viruses. It is thus important to monitor wild animals for the presence of various human and animal pathogens in order to identify a potential reservoir of infectious diseases. In this study, the first phylogenetic analysis of PBV from roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) was performed with a total of 70 investigated samples of feces from roe deer collected in 2014 and 2015 during a survey throughout Slovenia. A high detection rate of PBVs was observed with newly designed specific primers, 42 samples out of 70 (60%) being positive. Phylogenetic analysis of the partial RdRp gene showed that roe deer PBV sequences were distributed over the whole phylogenetic tree and were distributed between 7 highly supported groups and 12 separate branches within the PBV genogroup I. The animal PBV strain most closely related to roe deer PBV strains was the Rhesus macaque PBV/BGD/PbV-55 strain, with 89.1% nucleotide identity to that of PBV SLO/D80-14. Overall nucleotide sequence identity between PBV strains obtained from roe deer ranged from 60.4 to 100%, confirming the high genetic diversity with no subtypes related to host species or geographic location in general. This first phylogenetic survey of roe deer PBVs provides further knowledge concerning the putative host range and confirms the high genetic diversity of these PBVs.
2943199766	The seminal plasma is a very complex fluid, which surrounds sperm in semen. It contains numerous proteins including proteases and protease inhibitors that regulate proteolytic processes associated with protein activation and degradation. We previously identified a seminal protein, chicken liver trypsin inhibitor 1 (ClTI-1) over expressed in semen of roosters with high fertility, suggesting a role in male fertility. In the present study, we showed that ClTI-1 gene is actually SPINK2. Using normal healthy adult roosters, we showed that SPINK2 amount in seminal plasma was positively correlated with male fertility in chicken lines with highly contrasted genetic backgrounds (broiler and layer lines). Using affinity chromatography combined to mass spectrometry analysis and kinetic assays, we demonstrated for the first time that two chicken acrosin isoforms (acrosin and acrosin-like proteins) are the physiological serine protease targets of SPINK2 inhibitor. SPINK2 transcript was overexpressed all along the male tract, and the protein was present in the lumen as expected for secreted proteins. Altogether, these data emphasize the role of seminal SPINK2 Kazal-type inhibitor as an important actor of fertility in birds through its inhibitory action on acrosin isoforms proteins.
3149563794	Fusarium moniliforme (bakanae pathogen) could survive for considerably longer period in infected grains and stubbles of paddy stored at room temperature in Haryana. It had survived for 26 months in grains of cultivar Haryana Gaurav and for 16 months in those of Taraori Basmati and Basmati 370. F. moniliforme was found associated with none of the stubbles .after 14 and 18 months of storage in unsterilized and sterilized soil, respectively, however, it could survive for 26 and 28 months in dried stubble-pieces of Haryana Gaurav and Taraori Basmati stored independently of the soil. In soil infested with fungal propagules, the population of the pathogen increased initially for two months and could be detected only for 10 and 13 months from unsterilized and sterilized soil, respectively.
2055239477	Different mechanisms, such as chromosomal rearrangements, deletions, mutations, and methylation/demethylation of the promoter regions of genes, have been shown to be involved in acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). These genetic and epigenetic alterations lead to the activation of protooncogenes or to inactivation of tumour supressor genes promoting cell proliferation. One of the most frequently inactivated tumour supressor genes is TP53, which is altered in 50% of human tumours. In this study, we have analysed: (1) the complete coding region, all intron-exon junctions and noncoding regions of exons 1–11 of TP53 by lexon-DGGE; (2) the methylation status of the 5′ region of TP53 and (3) the deletion of one or both alleles of the gene by fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) in 57 ALL patients. Using these techniques, we have found promoter methylation in 32% of the cases, missense mutations in 8.8%, and deletion of one allele in 7.5% of the samples, with TP53 being altered in 40% of the ALL samples studied in this series. © 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc.
2055239587	The mosquito Aedes aegypti (L.) (Diptera: Culicidae) is the primary vector of dengue in the Americas. The use of chemical insecticides is recommended during outbreaks of dengue in order to reduce the number of adult mosquitoes; however, because Ae. aegypti is highly synanthropic, the use of insecticides in densely populated areas is a dangerous practice. Leptolegnia chapmanii Seymour (Straminipila: Peronosporomycetes) is an entomopathogenic microorganism that has demonstrated marked pathogenicity toward the larvae of a number of mosquito species, with little or no effect on non-target insects. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine the sublethal effects of L. chapmanii on fecundity, number of gonotrophic cycles, fertility, and relationship between wing length and fecundity in Ae. aegypti females. Ae. aegypti females that survived infection with L. chapmanii laid fewer eggs, had a smaller number of gonotrophic cycles, had shorter wings, and were less fertile than controls. This is the first study on the sublethal effects experienced by specimens of Ae. aegypti that survived infection with zoospores of L. chapmanii. Although field studies should be carried out, the results obtained in this study are encouraging because the high and rapid larval mortality caused by L. chapmanii coupled with the reduction of reproductive capacity in Ae. aegypti females seem to cause a significant reduction in the number of adults in the mid and long term, thereby reducing the health risks associated with Ae. aegypti.
2055239593	Gray leaf spot disease (GLS; caused by Cercospora zeae-maydis Tehon and Daniels) is among the major maize (Zea mays L.) production constraints in southern Africa. Maize is predominantly grown by small-scale farmers without fungicides; hence, there is need to develop GLS resistant hybrids. There is limited information about the mode of inheritance for GLS resistance in regionally adapted germplasm. This study was initiated to determine gene action controlling GLS resistance. Seventy-two hybrids were generated by mating 27 inbred lines in a North Carolina design II scheme. Experimental and check hybrids were evaluated in an 8 by 12 α-lattice design with two replications at three locations, during the 2004-2005 season. There was significant variation among the hybrids for GLS resistance and yield. Inbreds L13, L15, L18, L19, and L24, from A, N3, B, K, and SC heterotic groups, respectively, contributed high levels of resistance to hybrids. Both general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) effects were highly significant (P < 0.01), but the predominance of GCA for GLS (86%) and yield (74%) indicated that additive effects were more important than nonadditive gene action in controlling both traits. Hybrids ranked similarly for GLS across environments, suggest-ing that few significant crossover genotype by environment interactions, which would cause problems in hybrid selection, were observed. Overall, results indicated that it would be readily possible to develop inbred lines with high GLS resistance from this germplasm.
2055239716	POLYDACTYLISM in the chick has been the subject of numerous genetic investigations. The anatomy of the condition has been outlined in these papers. Very little work has been done on the embryology of the polydactyl foot. Research on the development of the condition, besides being of interest to the embryologist, may aid in the interpretation of some of the genetic relationships of polydactylism. The purpose of the present investigation has been to give an outline of the ossification processes occurring during embryonic life. Incidental observations on normal development have also been recorded.
2055239732	The elevated mRNA levels encoding matrix components in glomeruli isolated from streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats provide evidence that stimulation of matrix synthesis is important in early phases of diabetic glomerulopathy. We and others have demonstrated that high glucose stimulates collagen mRNA levels in short-term mesangial cell culture. To test whether transcriptional activation is operative and to gain insights into the underlying mechanisms, we studied a murine mesangial cell line stably transfected with a minigene expressing luciferase driven by 5'-flanking and first-intron regions of the alpha 1(IV) gene. High glucose stimulated luciferase activity dose and time dependently, with optimal stimulation (two-fold) achieved after 48 h in 450 mg/dL glucose (G450) versus 100 mg/dL (G100). We next tested the involvement of protein kinase C (PKC) because high glucose has been shown to stimulate de novo synthesis of diacylglycerol (DAG). Increasing PKC activity by treatment with a DAG analogue or active phorbol ester stimulated luciferase activity preferentially in G100; addition of the PKC inhibitors staurosporine or calphostin C markedly inhibited luciferase activity preferentially in G450. Thus high glucose promotes transcriptional activity of alpha 1(IV) gene through PKC activation. We also tested the involvement of protein kinase A (PKA). Intracellular cyclic AMP levels were increased two fold after 48 h in G450 versus G100, and addition of 8-Br-cAMP (0.1 mM) preferentially stimulated luciferase activity by almost three fold in G100 versus only 1.2-fold in G450. Hence, the signal-transduction mechanisms underlying the transcriptional activation of alpha 1(IV) gene in mesangial cells by high glucose are mediated by pathways involving the PKC system and possibly the cAMP/PKA system.
2055239733	Abstract Hepatocellular carcinoma is the leading cause of death and its incidence is rising year by year. There are numerous antioxidants available in various sources, including microorganisms. We had an attempt on validating the effect of diazepinomicin from Micromonospora strain against human hepatoma cell line (HepG2). Trypan blue exclusion assay was performed to determine the dead cells. Propidium iodide and Hoechst staining was performed to determine the apoptotic bodies. DNA fragmentation was performed on agarose gel electrophoresis and the expression of BAX and Bcl2 proteins were determined. Trypan blue exclusion assay showed dose-dependent cell death. Propidium iodide and Hoechst staining showed apoptotic bodies. DNA fragments were seen in both diazepinomicin 10 and 15 μM/mL treated Hep G2 cells. Western blot assay showed low intensity bands in diazepinomicin 10 and 15 μM/mL treated Hep G2 cells. Thus, the downregulation of these protein expressions reveal that the diazepinomicin has the ability to induce apoptosis. From all the parameters, it could be concluded that the diazepinomicin has anticancer potency against human hepatoma cell line (HepG2).
2055239738	The ubiquitin-proteasome pathway plays a critical role in the degradation of short-lived and regulatory proteins in a variety of cellular processes. The F-box proteins are part of the ubiquitin-ligase complexes, which mediate ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of phosphorylated proteins. We previously identified NFB42, an F-box protein that is highly enriched in the nervous system, as a binding partner for the herpes simplex virus 1 UL9 protein, the viral replication-initiator protein, in a yeast two-hybrid screen. In the present work, we find that coexpression of NFB42 and UL9 genes in 293T cells leads to a significant decrease in the level of UL9 protein. Treatment with the 26S-proteasome inhibitor MG132 restores the UL9 protein to normal levels. We have observed also that the UL9 protein is polyubiquitinated in vivo and that the interaction between NFB42 and the UL9 protein is dependent upon phosphorylation of the UL9 protein. These results suggest that the interaction of the UL9 protein with NFB42 results in its polyubiquitination and subsequent degradation by the 26S proteasome. They suggest further a mechanism by which latency of herpes simplex virus 1 can be established in neuronal cells.
2055239746	Abstract The theraphosid spider genus Vitalius contains several species found in southeastern Brazil. In this work, we used electrostimulation to obtain venom from Vitalius dubius and examined its general composition. Male spiders yielded significantly less (p  14 kDa but showed two staining bands of peptides
2055239801	The present study was carried out to determine the microbial quality and physicochemical properties of ground water in Ilaro, a semi-urban settlement. Plate count agar (PCA), MacConkey broth and eosin methylene blue agar (EMB) were used in the microbial analysis. The results showed that the most probable number (MPN) ranges from 0 – 50 per 100 ml while the total viable count (TVC) ranged from 0.07 x 10² – 4.12 x 10² cfu ml-1. Bacillus subtilis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter aerugenosa and Micrococcus luteus were isolated. The physicochemical properties measured using their respective meters showed that the water was acidic. It was concluded that treatment before consumption is necessary to avoid borne diseases.
2055239874	Background White leaf No.1 is a typical albino tea cultivar grown in China and it has received increased attention in recent years due to the fact that white leaves containing a high level of amino acids, which are very important components affecting the quality of tea drink. According to the color of its leaves, the development of this tea cultivar is divided into three stages: the pre-albinistic stage, the albinistic stage and the regreening stage. To understand the intricate mechanism of periodic albinism, a comparative proteomic approach based on two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry was adopted first time to identify proteins that changed in abundance during the three developmental periods.
2055239884	The carnivorous pitcher plants of the Sarraceniaceae, Nepenthaceae and Cephalotaceae seem to have developed attraction and rewarding systems which resemble those of many flowers. Contrary to a previous view, Batcsian mimicry does not appear to apply to pitcher traps because: (a) there is no evidence of insects visiting traps by mistake, (b) no model is known for any one of the traps, (c) the duration of the trap activity and the structure of the plant community are not compatible with a deceptive mimetic status, (d) nectar which is a real reward is provided to visiting insects by the pitcher plants. It is suggested that these plants perform mutual rather than deceptive relations with the insect communities in their habitats. Insects benefit from nectar which is provided by pitchers and which serves for their nutrition in habitats where sources of floral nectar might be either uncommon or absent. At the same time the insects pay the plants in a small portion of their community which is ‘sacrificed’ as prey and consumed by the plants, which grow in nutrient deficient soils.
2055239896	In the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC)-TNM (2009) staging system, the key prognostic factor in cutaneous melanoma is the depth of dermal invasion (Breslow thickness) with further refinement according to the presence of epidermal ulceration or dermal mitoses. Immunodetection of phosphohistone H3 has been shown to facilitate the identification of mitotic figures in various neoplasms. We selected 120 cases of primary cutaneous melanoma with completely annotated histopathologic parameters and clinical outcomes and performed double immunohistochemical staining for MLANA (Mart-1/Melan-A) and phosphohistone H3. One hundred and thirteen cases were amenable to antiphosphohistone H3 staining from 66 men and 47 women, with mean age of 64 years (9–93), including 61 superficial spreading type, 24 nodular, 6 lentigo maligna, 8 acral lentiginous, and 14 unclassified. The mean Breslow thickness was 2.53 mm (0.20–25), ulceration was present in 25/113 (22%) and the mean mitotic count was 3.2/mm2 (<1–29/mm2). In 27/113 (24%) of the cases, antiphosphohistone H3 failed to highlight mitotic figures anywhere in the tissue (normal or tumor cell), whereas in 86/113 (76%) antiphosphohistone H3 detected at least one mitotic figure. Among the latter, antiphosphohistone H3 did not detect mitotic figures in dermal tumor cells in 37/86 cases (43%), whereas anti-PHH3 identified at least one melanocytic mitotic figure in the other 49/86 cases (57%; range: 1–66/mm2). The relationship between phosphohistone H3 and manual mitotic count was statistically significant (Pearson correlation=0.59, P<0.0001). Logistic regression analyses demonstrated an association between the development of subsequent metastatic disease and the following variables: mitotic figures (odds ratio (OR)=5.7; P=0.0001); phosphohistone H3-positive mitotic figures (OR=3.0; P=0.008); Breslow thickness (OR=4.0 per mm; P=0.0002); ulceration (OR=3.94; P=0.008). The application of phosphohistone H3 immunohistochemistry to the description of primary cutaneous melanoma is useful in identifying mitotic figures, improves upon the specificity of this designation when used together with MLANA, and correlates with an increased risk for metastasis in univariate analyses.
2055239948	The inheritance of obesity has been analyzed in an intercross between the lean 129/Sv mouse strain and the obesity-prone EL/Suz mouse strain. The weights of three major fat pads were determined on 4-month-old mice, and the sum of these weights, divided by body weight, was used as an adiposity index. The strategy of selective DNA pooling was used as a primary screen to identify putative quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting adiposity index. DNA pools representing the leanest 15% and fattest 15% of the F2 progeny were compared for differential allelic enrichment using widely dispersed microsatellite variants. To evaluate putative QTLs, individual genotyping and interval mapping were employed to estimate QTL effects and assess statistical significance. One QTL affecting adiposity index, which accounted for 12.3% of phenotypic variance in gender-merged data, was mapped to the central region of Chromosome (Chr) 7. The QTL allele inherited from EL conferred increased adiposity. A second QTL that accounts for 6.3% of phenotypic variance was identified on Chr 1 near D1Mit211. At both QTLs, the data are consistent with dominant inheritance of the allele contributing to obesity. The possible relationships between these QTLs and previously described obesity QTLs, major obesity mutations, and candidate genes are discussed.
2055239951	Abstract Osmia lignaria is a solitary bee that over-winters as a fully eclosed, cocooned, unfed adult. Our objective is to understand the effect of wintering temperature on diapause maintenance and termination in this species. We measure respiration rates and weight loss in individuals exposed to various wintering temperatures (0, 4, 7, 22 °C, outdoors) and durations (28, 84, 140, 196, 252 days). We use time to emerge and respiration response (respiration rate measured at 22 °C) as indicators of diapause intensity. Adults spontaneously lower their respiration rates to ∼0.1 ml/g h within 1 month after adult eclosion, indicating obligatory diapause. Non-wintered individuals maintain low respiration rates, but lose weight rapidly and die by mid-winter. In wintered adults, two phases can be distinguished. First, respiration response undergoes a rapid increase and then reaches a plateau. This phase is similar in bees wintered at 0, 4 and 7 °C. In the second phase, respiration response undergoes an exponential increase, which is more pronounced at the warmer temperatures. Composite exponential functions provide a good fit to the observed respiration patterns. Adults whose respiration response has reached 0.45 ml/g h emerge promptly when exposed to 20 °C, indicating diapause completion. Individuals wintered for short periods do not reach such respiration levels. When exposed to 20 °C these individuals lower their metabolic rate, and their emergence time is extended. The relationship between respiration rates and emergence time follows a negative exponential function. We propose two alternative models of diapause termination to interpret these results.
2943199961	The tremendous diversity of plants and herbivores has arisen from a coevolutionary relationship characterized by plant defense and herbivore counter adaptation. Pierid butterfly species feed on Brassicales plants that produce glucosinolates as a chemical deterrent against herbivory. In turn, the larvae of pierids have nitrile specifier proteins (NSPs) that are expressed in their gut and disarm glucosinolates. Pierid butterflies are known to have diversified in response to glucosinolate diversification in Brassicales. Therefore, each pierid species is expected to have a spectrum of host plants characterized by specific glucosinolate profiles. In this study, we tested whether the larval performance of different Pieris species, a genus in Pieridae (Lepidoptera: Pieridae), was associated with plant defense traits of putative host plants. We conducted feeding assays using larvae of three Pieris species and 10 species of the Brassicaceae family possessing different leaf physical traits and glucosinolate profile measurements. The larvae of Pieris rapae responded differently in the feeding assays compared with the other two Pieris species. This difference was associated with differences in glucosinolate profiles but not with variations in physical traits of the host plants. This result suggests that individual Pieris species are adapted to a subset of glucosinolate profiles within the Brassicaceae. Our results support the idea that the host ranges of Pieris species depend on larval responses to glucosinolate diversification in the host species, supporting the hypothesis of coevolution between butterflies and host plants mediated by the chemical arms race.
2943200044	Dispersal facilitates population health and maintains resilience in species via gene flow. Adult dispersal occurs in some species, is often facultative, and is poorly understood, but has important management implications, particularly with respect to disease spread. Although the role of adult dispersal in spreading disease has been documented, the potential influence of disease on dispersal has received little attention. African buffalo (Syncerus caffer) are wide-ranging and harbor many pathogens that can affect nearby livestock. Dispersal of adult buffalo has been described, but ecological and social drivers of buffalo dispersal are poorly understood. We investigated drivers of adult buffalo dispersal during a 4-year longitudinal study at Kruger National Park, South Africa. We monitored the spatial movement of 304 female buffalo in two focal areas using satellite and radio collars, capturing each buffalo every 6 months to assess animal traits and disease status. We used generalized linear mixed models to determine whether likelihood of dispersal for individual female buffalo was influenced by animal traits, herd identity, environmental variables, gastrointestinal parasites, or microparasite infections. The likelihood and drivers of buffalo dispersal varied by herd, area, and year. In the Lower Sabie herd, where resources were abundant, younger individuals were more likely to disperse, with most dispersal occurring in the early wet season and during an unusually dry year, 2009. In the resource-poor Crocodile Bridge area, buffalo in poor condition were most likely to disperse. Our findings suggest that dispersal of female buffalo is driven by either seasonal (Lower Sabie) or perhaps social (Crocodile Bridge) resource restriction, indicating resource limitation and dispersal decisions are tightly linked for this social ungulate. We found no direct effects of infections on buffalo dispersal, assuaging fears that highly infectious individuals might be more prone to dispersing, which could accelerate the spatial spread of infectious diseases.
2943200075	Cancer is a multifactorial condition with aberrant growth of cells. A substantial number of cancers, breast in particular, are hormone sensitive and evolve due to malfunction in the steroidogenic machinery. Breast cancer, one of the most prevalent form of cancers in women, is primarily stimulated by estrogens. Steroid hormones are made from cholesterol, and regulation of steroid/estrogen biosynthesis is essentially influenced by the steroidogenic acute regulatory (StAR) protein. Although the impact of StAR in breast cancer remains a mystery, we recently reported that StAR protein is abundantly expressed in hormone sensitive breast cancer, but not in its non-cancerous counterpart. Herein, we analyzed genomic profiles, hormone receptor expression, mutation, and survival for StAR and steroidogenic enzyme genes in a variety of hormone sensitive cancers. These profiles were specifically assessed in breast cancer, exploiting The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) datasets. Whereas StAR and key steroidogenic enzyme genes evaluated (CYP11A1, HSD3B, CYP17A1, CYP19A1, and HSD17B) were altered to varying levels in these hormone responsive cancers, amplification of the StAR gene was correlated with poor overall survival of patients afflicted with breast cancer. Amplification of the StAR gene and its correlation to survival was also verified in a number of breast cancer studies. Additionally, TCGA breast cancer tumors associated with aberrant high expression of StAR mRNA were found to be an unfavorable risk factor for survival of patients with breast cancer. Further analyses of tumors, nodal status, and metastases of breast cancer tumors expressing StAR mRNA displayed cancer deaths in stage specific manners. The majority of these tumors were found to express estrogen and progesterone receptors, signifying a link between StAR and luminal subtype breast cancer. Collectively, analyses of genomic and molecular profiles of key steroidogenic factors provide novel insights that StAR plays an important role in the biologic behavior and/or pathogenesis of hormone sensitive breast cancer.
2943200412	Communication and material transfer between membranes and organelles take place at membrane contact sites (MCSs). MCSs between the ER and PM, the ER/PM junctions, are the sites where the ER Ca2+ sensor STIM1 and the PM Ca2+ influx channel Orai1 cluster. MCSs are formed by tether proteins that bridge the opposing membranes, but the identity and role of these tethers in receptor-evoked Ca2+ signaling is not well understood. Here, we identified Anoctamin 8 (ANO8) as a key tether in the formation of the ER/PM junctions that is essential for STIM1-STIM1 interaction and STIM1-Orai1 interaction and channel activation at a ER/PM PI(4,5)P2-rich compartment. Moreover, ANO8 assembles all core Ca2+ signaling proteins: Orai1, PMCA, STIM1, IP3 receptors, and SERCA2 at the ER/PM junctions to mediate a novel form of Orai1 channel inactivation by markedly facilitating SERCA2-mediated Ca2+ influx into the ER. This controls the efficiency of receptor-stimulated Ca2+ signaling, Ca2+ oscillations, and duration of Orai1 activity to prevent Ca2+ toxicity. These findings reveal the central role of MCSs in determining efficiency and fidelity of cell signaling.
2943200669	Indonesia is the fourth most populous country in the world. Plastic is one form of garbage that composes national level waste. Every year more than 260 million tons of plastic are produced in the world. Plastic waste can be degraded completely with a very long time, so a study is needed to reduce the accumulation of plastic waste. The purpose of this study was to determine the characteristics of plastic breaker bacteria, determine the tolerance level of isolates to plastic precursor stresses, determine the potential of isolates in synthesizing phytohormones, and determine the potential of isolates in synthesizing specific metabolites that play a role in tolerance of isolates to plastic precursors. The stages of this research include taking soil samples from landfill, tool and media sterilization, growing media preparation (M63 and Lactose Broth), TPA soil bacterial isolation, identifying bacterial colonies, making stock culture, gram staining test, biodegradation test on a level, biofertilizer test using Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry MS(GC-MS), and analyzed descriptively (images, graphs and tables). Based on the results of the study, diversity variables found 14 different types of bacteria in terms of bacterial morphology. The seven isolates had environmental tolerance containing 100% plastic precursors. The isolates obtained were able to synthesize compounds: α Aminobutyric acid (C4H9NO2) 1,15% for control and 1,20% for treatment, 3 Indoleacetic acid (C10H9NO2) 1,90% for control and 1,85% for treatment, Kinetin (C10H9N5O) 1,11% for control and 1,16% for treatment, N6 Benzyladenine 9 glucoside (C18H21N5O5) 1,26% for control and 1,31% for treatment, Kinetin glucoside (C16H19N5O7) 1,13% for control and 1,19% for treatment which acts as fitohormone. The isolates obtained were able to synthesize specific metabolites: Malic acid (

2240754462	Publisher Summary Extant mitochondrial genomes are diverse in size, gene content, and organization. In this chapter, mitochondrial genomes are introduced and their structure and gene content, replication, transcription, and translation are explained in detail. Respiratory-deficient mutants, mutants affected in complex III or complex IV, mutants resistant to myxothiazol, mutants affected in complex I, mutants affected in more than one complex, complex I assembly in wild type and in nd mutants, suppressor mutations are also elaborated. Mitochondrial genome transmission is explained well under the transmission of mitochondrial genes in meiotic zygotes, vegetative zygotes, cytoductants. ChlamydomonasMitochondria have evolved from eubacteria-like endosymbionts whose closest known relatives are the Rickettsia group of a-proteobacteria. Over time, many genes have disappeared or have been transferred to the nuclear genome. In that respect, Chlamydomonas is a useful model to study mitochondrial function in a photosynthetic organism. Mitochondrial respiratory-deficient mutants are homoplasmic and viable if maintained under photoautotrophic conditions. This enables the isolation of complex I, III, or IV mutants that are amenable to biochemical and molecular studies. A major advance has been the establishment of biolistic transformation of the mitochondrial genome to reconstruct mutations in genes encoding complex I subunits.
2240754587	Chitradurga District, the fort city is one of the prominent historical places in Central Karnataka of India. With an area of 8440 square kilometers and a population of 151 thousand across 1059 villages, the district is dependent mainly on agricultural economy. Majority of farmers are dependent on rainwater harvesting for agriculture, and failure of monsoon will in turn spike the poverty and death rates by suicide as a result of inability to pay up loans. Death by means of hanging forms the 3rd common cause of unnatural death after head injury and poisoning. Suicide by means of hanging forms the 2nd common cause of unnatural death after poisoning.
2240754926	The new biotechnologies of gene transfer, in-vitro production, cloning and sexing of embryos have been developed and are being refined with efficiencies suitable for use in animal agriculture. Efficient in-vitro systems for maturing oocytes and capacitating spermatozoa, for fertilizing and developing the embryos have resulted in commercial in-vitro production of embryos. Cloning of embryos by nuclear transfer has been accomplished for sheep, cattle, pigs and rabbits with nuclear material supplied by embryos as late as the 120-cell stage in sheep. Embryos have been recloned but much research is needed to increase the efficiency of this procedure. Research is needed to develop the use of cultured cells in embryo cloning so that the number of clones may be increased to thousands or millions. Embryos of most species can be sexed in a non-damaging way with male specific antibodies and a more efficient method, amplified DNA hybridization, is beginning to be tested commercially. Transgenic embryos or offspring have been produced for mice, rats, rabbits, chickens, fish, sheep, pigs and cattle. Genes can be targeted for expression in specific tissues but more efficient methods and a better understanding of the genes to be transferred as well as control by man of the time and tissue of specific gene expression are needed. Before many transgenic animals of value can be made, we must know which genes to introduce. Presently there is a poor understanding of the genes influencing animal growth, efficiency of growth, environmental adaptation, meat, milk or egg composition or animal disease resistance. Their identification will come from badly needed efforts to map the genome of domestic animals. These and other new technologies promise to change livestock breeding drastically in the next decade.
3149564352	To investigate the cytogenetic parameters and characterise the chromosomal banding pattern of Tho-Tho cattle, a breed of indigenous cattle found in the Northeastern states of India were reared for meat purpose. Lymphocyte culture technique was carried out in 28 Tho-Tho cattle and culture was harvested for good metaphase spread. Good metaphase spreads were selected for analysis, such as relative length, centromeric index and arm ratio. Centromeric banding (C-banding) and reverse banding (R-banding) methods were done for detail and better understanding of the chromosome morphology. The chromosome number in Tho-Tho cattle was observed to be 2n = 60 in all complete metaphase. The mean relative length of the autosomal chromosomes varied from 5.48% ± 0.107% to 1.79% ± 0.105% in male and 5.31% ± 0.148% to 1.86% ± 0.055% in female, respectively. The chromosome banding showed C-positive dark band heterochromatin in all the acrocentric autosome. However, in sex chromosome, the Y-chromosome showed negative C-band and also the X-chromosome did not show any stain at the centromeric region. The numbers of R-band pattern were observed to be 490 and 499 band in male and female, respectively. One of the X-chromosome showed light banding pattern, confirming the inactivation during the embryonic development in female. The fundamental chromosome number and banding pattern of Tho-Tho cattle did not vary from the other breed of the Bos indicus. However, it is necessary to start a cytogenetic screening of the Tho-Tho cattle and expand upon more number to be kept at different villages of Nagaland in order to identify animals with chromosomal abnormalities, so that it can be excluded from future breeding strategies for conservation of Tho-Tho genetic resource.
3149564354	i.e., resource-poor women, infants and children) globally is to enrich major staple food crops (e.g., rice, wheat, maize, beans and cassava) with micronutrients through plant-breeding strategies. These target groups are dependent on these staples for their sustenance. Available research has demonstrated that micronutrientenrichment traits are available within the genomes of these major staple food crops that could allow for substantial increases in the levels of Fe, Zn and provitamin A carotenoids (as well as other nutrients and health-promoting factors) without negatively impacting crop yield. Furthermore, Fe- and Zn-dense seeds can increase crop yields when sowed to soils deficient in these nutrients ensuring their adoption by farmers in these regions once they are developed. Importantly, micronutrient bioavailability issues must be addressed when using a plant-breeding approach to eliminating micronutrient malnutrition. The reduction of antinutrient substances that inhibit micronutrient bioavailability or the increase in substances that promote micronutrient bioavailability from staple plant foods are both options that could be pursued in breeding programs, although care needs to be taken not to compromise agronomic performance and sufficient attention paid to possible beneficial roles of compounds which reduce the bioavailability of trace minerals. The time has come to invest in agricultural technologies to find sustainable solutions to micronutrient malnutrition. Plant breeding is one such technology that should be adopted by the world’s agricultural community and that should be supported by the world’s nutrition and health communities.
2240755741	Objective To construct the recombinant adenovirus vector with hTERT-HSV-TK and observe the killing effect of Ad-hTERTp-HSV-TK/GCV system on hepatocellular carcinoma cells. Methods A recombinant replication defective adenoviral vector of Ad-hTERTp-HSV-TK was constructed via homologous recombination which both shuttle plasmid pSU-Tp-TK and adenovirus backbone plasmid pBHGE3 transfected into the HEK293 packaging cells. Then the Ad-hTERTp-HSV-TK was amplified and purified through PCR. The activity of the HepG2 cells and the L-02 cells were tested by methyl thiazolyl terazolium (MTT) after they were transfected by the recombinant adenovirus of different multiplicities of infection (MOI) and then were added GCV of different conc.entration. Results The recombinant replication defective adenoviral vector of Ad-hTERTp-HSV-TK were identified by PCR successfully. The viral titer was 1.5×1010 pfu/ml after amplification and purification. The HepG2 cells were targetedly suppressed by Ad-hTERTp-HSV-TK/GCV system. The survival rate of cells decreased gradually along with the increase of the MOI and the GCV' s concentration. Conclusion The recombinant replication defective adenoviral vector of Ad-hTERTp-HSV-TK can inhibit the HepG2 cells significantly, but has not influence on the L-02 cells.

2240755950	The present work is one of the first studies investigating the vertical distribution of the benthic toxic dinoflagellates Ostreopsis cf. ovata, Prorocentrum lima and Coolia monotis in the NW mediterranean Sea. Relatively low epiphytic abundances of the three species were detected up to 30 m depth in late August-early September, suggesting that higher abundances may be found earlier in summer. Ostreopsis cf. ovata was more abundant than the two other species at very shallow depths, while P. lima and C. monotis were more present than O. cf. ovata at depths deeper than 3 m. The decrease of O. cf. ovata with depth likely reflected the temperature and light intensity depletion. Determination and understanding of vertical patterns require defining the ecological niche of each species, including their responses to light, temperature and nutrients. Nutritional mode and chemical defense of dinoflagellates may also affect their ecological niches. A better assessment of the vertical distribution of toxic microalgae could be very useful for a suitable management and an effective anticipation of hAB events. Resume : Distribution verticale des Dinoflagelles toxiques epibenthiques ostreopsis cf. ovata, Prorocentrum lima et Coolia monotisen Mediterranee Nord-Occidentale. L'etude presentee est l'une des premieres a analyser la repartition verticale des dinoflagelles toxiques benthiques Ostreopsis cf. ovata, Prorocentrum lima et Coolia monotis en mediterranee Nord- occidentale. Des abondances epiphytiques relativement faibles de ces trois especes ont ete detectees jusqu'a 30 metres de profondeur a la fin du mois d'aout et au debut du mois de septembre, ce qui suggere que des abondances plus elevees pourraient etre mesurees plus tot durant l'ete. Ostreopsis cf. ovata etait plus abondante que les deux autres especes a tres faibles profondeurs, alors que P. lima and C. monotis etaient plus abondances qu'O. cf. ovata aux profondeurs superieures a 3 metres. La diminution de l'abondance d'O. cf. ovata avec la profondeur est en relation avec la baisse de la temperature et de l'intensite lumineuse. Le determinisme de cette repartition verticale necessite la definition des niches ecologiques de chaque espece, incluant leurs reponses a la lumiere, a la temperature et aux nutriments. Le mode nutritionnel et la defense chimique des dinoflagelles peuvent egalement influencer les contours de leurs niches ecologiques. une meilleure estimation de la distribution verticale des microalgues toxiques pourrait se reveler utile pour la mise en place d'une gestion adaptee et une anticipation efficace des evenements de hAB.
3149564766	Copy number variations have been found in patients with neural tube abnormalities.In this study,we performed genome-wide screening using high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization in three children with tethered spinal cord syndrome and two healthy parents.Of eight copy number variations,four were non-polymorphic.These non-polymorphic copy number variations were associated with Angelman and Prader-Willi syndromes,and microcephaly.Gene function enrichment analysis revealed that COX8 C,a gene associated with metabolic disorders of the nervous system,was located in the copy number variation region of Patient 1.Our results indicate that array-based comparative genomic hybridization can be used to diagnose tethered spinal cord syndrome.Our results may help determine the pathogenesis of tethered spinal cord syndrome and prevent occurrence of this disease.
2055239958	Two species of anaerobic fungi, i.e. Piromyces strain E2 and Neocallimastix patriciarum strain N2, were cultivated in a 10-l batch fermenter with filter- paper cellulose as the carbon source. The accumulation of fermentation products, production of extracellular protein and (hemi-)cellulolytic enzymes were monitored during growth. Growth of Piromyces E2 in the fermenter resulted in a shift in the fermentation pattern to more acetate and formate and less ethanol, lactate, succinate and malate, possibly because of removal of hydrogen. The specific activities of Avicelase, endoglucanase, β-glucosidase and xylanase were up to threefold higher compared to small batch cultures. Enzyme activities produced per gram of cellulose were up to four times the values reported for Piromyces E2 grown in a semi-continuous coculture with the methanogen Methanobacterium formicicum. The performance of fermenter enzyme preparations from the anaerobic fungi with respect to hydrolysis of Avicel compared well to that of preparations of Trichoderma reesei. However, addition of exogenous β-glucosidase was indispensible with the latter preparation for the complete conversion to glucose.
2055239986	KIT gene is the major causative gene for coat color variation in diverse animal species. This gene regulates melanocyte migration from the neural crest to target tissues and the mutation of this gene can affect dominant white phenotypes in animals. Because this gene has a major influence for the coat color variation, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 14 Korean cattle (Hanwoo) and 5 Holstein individuals were investigated. The Hanwoo DNA samples included three different colored (5 Black, 5 Yellow and 4 Stripe) animals. Total 126 polymorphisms have been identified and 23 of them are located in the exon region. Also, 5 bp (TTCTC) and 3 bp (TCT) intronic indels in intron 3 and intron 5, respectively, were identified. Out of 23 exonic polymorphisms, 15 SNPs are the missense mutations and the rest of the SNPs are silence mutations. The neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree was constructed for the different colored animals using the obtained KIT gene sequences. Holstein breed showed a clear breed-specific cluster in the phylogenetic tree which is differed from Hanwoo. Also, three colored Hanwoo animals were not discriminated among the breeds. The KIT gene polymorphisms identified in this study will possibly give some solutions for the color variations in cattle with further verifications.
2055240008	Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have demonstrated a measurable therapeutic effect following transplantation into animal models of spinal cord injury. However, the mechanism(s) by which transplanted cells promote nerve regeneration and/or functional recovery remains indeterminate. Several studies have suggested that MSCs promote tissue repair via secretion of trophic factors, but delineating the effect of such factors is difficult due to the complexity of the in vivo systems. Therefore, we developed an organotypic spinal cord slice culture system that can be sustained for sufficient periods of time in vitro to evaluate nerve regeneration as an ex vivo model of spinal cord injury. Using this model, we demonstrate that treatment of lumbar slices of spinal cord with lysolecithin induced a significant degree of cell death and demyelination of nerve fibers, but that these effects were ameliorated to a significant extent following co-culture of slices with human MSCs (hMSCs). The results indicate that transplanted hMSCs alter the tissue microenvironment in a way that promotes survival of endogenous cells, including injured neurons, immature oligodendrocytes and oligodendrocyte progenitor cells. This ex vivo culture system represents a useful tool to further dissect the mechanism(s) by which MSCs promote regeneration of injured nervous tissue.
2055240026	Nostoc sp. strain ATCC 29133 (PCC 73102; Nostoc 29133) is a symbiotically-competent, facultatively heterotrophic, diazotrophic cyanobacterium with the capacity to differentiate specialized cells such as heterocysts, akinetes and hormogonial filaments. We have optimized several methods for physiological and molecular genetic analysis of Nostoc 29133. By use of a Tn5 derivative, Tn5-1063 (Kmr Bmr Smr), delivered by conjugation from Escherichia coli, antibiotic-resistant mutants of Nostoc 29133 were generated at a frequency of approximately 1 × 10-6, 0.4% of which expressed a nitrogen fixation (heterocyst) defective phenotype. Mutant strain UCD 328 was isolated after co-culture of 86 Nostoc 29133::Tn5-1063 clones with the symbiotic plant partner, Anthoceros punctatus; strain UCD 328 expressed a symbiotic phenotype of increased frequency of hormogonia-dependent infection. The transposon and flanking genomic DNA was recovered from strain UCD 328, the mutation and phenotype reconstructed by homologous recombination in Nostoc 29133, and the transposition site identified from a Nostoc 29133 genomic library. Transposon mutagenesis has thus provided the means for isolation and identification of developmental and symbiotic-specific genes of Nostoc 29133.
2055240029	The effects of endothelin have been studied in isolated arterial segments (0.8-1 mm in external diam.) of human omental arteries obtained during the course of abdominal operations (15 patients, 7 men and 8 women). Paired segments, one normal and the other de-endothelized, were mounted for isometric recording of tension in organ baths. Endothelin produced concentration-dependent contractions with an EC50 value of 5.4 x 10(-9) M. Removal of endothelium did not affect significantly endothelin-induced contractions (EC50, 6.7 x 10(-9) M). Removal of extracellular calcium or addition of the calcium channel blocker nicardipine (10(-6) M) diminished but did not abolish responses to endothelin. These results indicate that endothelin exerts powerful contractile effects on human isolated omental arteries which are independent of the presence of an intact endothelial cell layer; this contraction cannot be explained solely by voltage-dependent calcium channels.
2055240030	Abstract Objective To demonstrate the hypothesis that aerobic exercise training inhibits the development of insulin resistance through IL-6 and probe into the possible molecular mechanism about it. Methods Rats were raised with high-fat diets for 8 weeks to develop insulin resistance, and glucose infusion rates (GIRs) were determined by hyperinsulinemic–euglycemic clamping to confirm the development of insulin resistance. Aerobic exercise training (the speed and duration time in the first week were respectively 16 m/min and 50 min, and speed increased 1 m/min and duration time increased 5 min every week following it) and/or IL-6shRNA plasmid injection (rats received IL-6shRNA injection via the tail vein every two weeks) were adopted during the development of insulin resistance. The serum IL-6, leptin, adiponectin, fasting blood glucose, fasting serum insulin, GIR, IL-6 gene expression levels, p-p38 in various tissues and p-STAT3/t-STAT3 ratio in the liver were measured. Results Rats fed with high-fat diets for 8 weeks were developed insulin resistance and the IL-6mRNA levels of IL-6shRNA injection groups in various tissues were significantly lower than those of control group (P   0.05). The p-p38 significantly increased in the rats fed with high-fat diets, however, p-p38 of the exercise high-fat diets rats in the liver and fat tissues significantly decreased than that (P   0.05). Conclusions In conclusion, aerobic exercise training prevented the development of insulin resistance through IL-6 to a certain degree. The gene expression and secretion of IL-6 could inhibit the development of insulin resistance. The mechanism of the effects were possibly related with elevating the levels of serum adiponectin, and/or inhibiting the activation of STAT3 in the liver and p38MAPK in the skeletal muscles, liver and fat tissues.
2055240043	A recently developed fluorescence histochemical technique, which both fixes the brain in situ and converts catecholamines to fluorescent derivatives, has been utilised to study the distribution of catecholamine-conataining cell bodies in the central nervous system of the rabbit, a species particularly suited to cardiovascular investigation.    Catecholamine-conataining cells are widely distributed through the brain stem but are absent from the spinal cord, the cerbellum and the telencephalon. In the medulla the cells form separate ventrolateral and dorsomedial groups, while pontine cells form a continuous gruop, comprising cells of the locus coeruleus, the subcoeruleus and the ventrolateral pontine area. Fluorescent cella are widely distributed in the midbrain including an extensive group in the substantia nigra and a smaller dorsal group in the central gray matter just ventral to the aqueduct. Nearly all fluorescent forebrain cells are found in the hypothalamus, in the arcuate nucleus and in the more caudal reigons of the dorsal hypothalamus.    Although the general arragement of the catecholamine-containing cells is similar to that of the rat there are some readily appreciated differences. Ventrolateral medullary cells are more tightly grouped in the rabbit and dorsomedial medullary cells extend forther rostrally, some being found within the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus. Locus coeruleus cells are more loosely arranged in the rabbit and the subcoeruleus group is more extensive. Midbrain cells are closely comparable but the caudal thalamic group described in the rat is less extensive in the rabbit.
2055240066	The availability of rapid and quantitative titration assays for retroviral vectors is important, especially in the context of clinical applications. In this report, we describe a novel assay to titrate lentiviral and gamma retroviral vectors. This rapid assay is based on protein fragment complementation involving the N-terminal (Bla1) and the C-terminal (Bla2) fragments of TEM-1 β-lactamase (BLAK). The Bla1 protein fragment is incorporated in the vector's envelope during vector production. Bla1-bearing vectors are titrated on Bla2-expressing cells. Upon transduction, Bla1 and Bla2 heterodimerize and restore BLAK's enzymatic function. The enzymatic activity of BLAK is quantified by flow cytometry using the green fluorescent CCF2/AM substrate, which is converted into a blue fluorescent product. The enzymatic conversion of the CCF2/AM substrate was found to be directly related to vector entry, as a neutralizing antibody completely blocked the conversion. The titers obtained using this rapid assay correlated well with the titers measured by functional transduction assays. The whole assay can be finished within 8 h. Thus, it is considerably less time consuming compared with other transduction-based titration assays for lentiviral and gamma retroviral vectors.
2055240086	In the SMXA recombinant inbred (RI) strains, we measured body weight, blood insulin and lipid (triglyceride, total cholesterol and phospholipid) levels in each strain. In the five traits, mean values of substrains varied remarkably and showed a continuous spectrum of distribution, suggesting control by multiple genes at distinct loci for each trait. We also screened for quantitative trait loci (QTLs) involved in the five traits. Suggestive QTLs for body weight (Chromosomes 1 and 6), insulin (Chromosomes 1, 3, 10 and 17), triglyceride (Chromosomes 4 and 11) and phospholipid (Chromosome 18) levels were detected. The SMXA RI strains are unique tools for analyzing genetic factors that influence body weight, blood insulin and lipids levels.
2055240093	Recent genome-wide association studies have implicated the clusterin gene in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease. The expression and function of clusterin in the developing brain, however, is poorly understood. In this study, we have characterized the zebrafish clusterin gene and determined its structural conservation, developmental expression, and physiological regulation. The structure of the zebrafish clusterin gene and protein is similar to its human orthologue. Biochemical assays show that zebrafish Clusterin is a secreted protein that cannot bind IGFs. In adult zebrafish, clusterin mRNA is detected in many tissues. In early development, clusterin mRNA becomes detectable at 12 h postfertilization, and its levels gradually increase thereafter. In situ hybridization analysis indicates that clusterin mRNA is specifically expressed in the developing diencephalic and myelencephalic choroid plexus. Among various stresses tested, heat shock, but not hypoxic or ionic stresses, increases the levels of clusterin mRNA. Inhibition of the IGF-I receptor-mediated signaling or overexpression of IGF ligands did not change clusterin mRNA levels. In comparison, inhibition or targeted knockdown of Notch signaling significantly increased clusterin mRNA expression in choroid plexus. These results suggest that clusterin is a marker of choroid plexus in zebrafish, and its expression in the developing choroid plexus is under the regulation of Notch but not IGF signaling.
2055240146	Paxillin is a protein containing four LIM domains, and functions in integrin signaling. We report here that two transcripts are generated from the paxillin gene locus in Drosophila; one encodes a protein homolog of the vertebrate Paxillin (DPxn37), and the other a protein with only three LIM domains, partly encoded by its own specific exon (PDLP). At the myotendinous junctions of Drosophila embryos where integrins play important roles, both DPxn37 and PDLP are highly expressed with different patterns; DPxn37 is predominantly concentrated at the center of the junctions, whereas PDLP is highly enriched at neighboring sides of the junction centers, primarily expressed in the mesodermal myotubes. Northern blot analysis revealed that DPxn37 is ubiquitously expressed throughout the life cycle, whereas PDLP expression exhibits a biphasic pattern during development, largely concomitant with muscle generation and remodeling. Our results collectively reveal that a unique system exists in Drosophila for the generation of a novel type of LIM-only protein, highly expressed in the embryonic musclature, largely utilizing the Paxillin LIM domains.
2055240199	Abstract The adherence and transmigration of T cells through microvascular endothelium is an essential step for recruitment into inflammatory lesions, although the factors that stimulate the directional migration of T cells have not been fully characterized. In the present study we investigated the capacity of chemokines to induce migration of T cells across dermal microvascular endothelial cell monolayer. The results showed that recombinant MCP-1 significantly induced transendothelial migration of both resting and activated T cells. Maximal induction of migration was observed at a concentration of 10 ng/ml and a 3- to 4-hr incubation period. In contrast, the chemokines IL-8, RANTES, and MIP-1α failed to stimulate T cell migration at doses as high as 100 ng/ml. In studies designed to investigate the intracellular signaling pathways mediating the MCP-1 effect, the results showed that MCP-1 at doses ranging from 10 to 100 ng/ml did not cause an increase in intracellular calcium ions in T cells, even though this chemokine induced rapid calcium mobilization in monocytes. Furthermore, pretreatment of T cells with either bisindolymaleimide HCl, a specific inhibitor of protein kinase C, or genistein, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, significantly decreased the MCP-1-induced transmigration in a dose-dependent manner. In contrast, T cells pretreated with the protein kinase A-specific inhibitor H89 responded normally to MCP-1 stimulation. Finally, T cell transmigration was inhibited by antibodies against CD11a, thereby confirming the importance of β2-integrin in the transmigration process.
2055240262	Spores ofPolypodium chnoodes Spreng. were found to possess a large winged perispore surrounding the exospore. This character had hitherto been found only in the closely related families of the aspidioid-dennstaedtioid complex. Its presence in a species ofPolypodium is another example of the remarkable parallelisms which occur in ferns.
2055240308	The cytotoxic effects in vivo of single doses of either adriamycin (ADM), 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine (Ara-C), bleomycin (BLM), cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cis-DDP), or cyclophosphamide (CY) on murine fibrosarcoma (FSa) cell populations were determined. Tumour cells were separated and synchronized by centrifugal elutriation. Viable tumour cells from selected elutriator fractions were then injected i.v. into whole-body-irradiated mice. Twenty minutes later selected doses of ADM, Ara-C, BLM, cis-DDP or CY were administered to selected groups of these animals. Fourteen days later the mice were killed. Killing of injected tumour cells by each of the chemotherapeutic agents was evidenced by a reduction in the lung cells by each of the chemotherapeutic agents was evidenced by a reduction in the lung colonies per cell injected in treated animals. Under these conditions the response of FSa cells in vivo to the 5 drugs tested differed both qualitatively and quantitatively. Ara-C was S-phase-specific in toxicity. ADM, BLM, and cis-DDP were preferentially toxic to S, G2+M and G1 cells respectively. CY, a drug requiring bioactivation to form alkylating metabolites, was found to be equally toxic to G1 and G2+M enriched populations, but less effective in killing cell populations enriched with early-S cells.
2055240356	From a newly determined cDNA sequence of the human ERK gene, a highly hydrophobic portion was identified upstream of the putative tyrosine kinase domain. This is the first evidence that the ERK protein possesses a receptor-like membrane-spanning structure. Fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of R-banded metaphase chromosomes revealed that the ERK gene is located in chromosome region 1p36.1. This locus is near the frequent translocation breakpoint or deletion region of neuroblastoma and some other cancers. A comparative mapping study of the mouse and rat homologues indicated that each counterpart maps to the mouse chromosome 4D2.2-D3 and rat chromosome 5q36.13 regions, both of which have conserved linkage homology to human chromosome 1p.
2055240415	The blowfly Calliphora erythrocephala rotates its wings, i.e. changes the geometrical angle of attack, generating forces and moments for flight steering. There are two possibile ways to regulate this angle. The mechanisms for these movements are described. (1) The leading edge and the anterior part of the wing — between the costal vein and radial vein 4 — are pronated automatically due to the interaction of the moving parts during the downstroke. They are supinated during the upstroke. This is “basic” automatic regulation. (2) The posterior part of the wing — behind the anterior cross vein — is pronated and supinated independently of wing-drive. This is “wing-drive independent” additional regulation.
2943200843	"The main aim of this thesis was to infer mammalian gene regulatory networks from tens of thousands gene expression profiles via a new ""reverse-engineering"" approach. Human arid Mouse gene regulatory networks were both inferred and the results collected in a database that represents part of the non-written material that will support. the thesis (http: //rretview. tigem. it). Each gene regulatory network consists of a set of gene pairs (connections) and a score based on Mutual Information, which states their statistical dependence. The inferred connections are organized into a network that allows exploration of the global features of gene regulation in a mammalian cell. We collected a massive and heterogeneous dataset of 22,255 gene expression profiles from a variety of human samples and experimental conditions. We developed a new mutual-information (MI) reverse-engineering approach able to quantify the extent to which the mRNA levels of two genes are related to each other across such a complex dataset. The resulting network consists of 4,817,629 connections among 22,255 transcripts. The inferred connections were compared against known protein-protein and other regulatory interactions to assess their biological significance. We experimentally identified a subset of predicted protein-protein interactions not previously described in the literature. We discovered regulatory modules within the network, consisting of genes strongly connected to each other, which carry out specific biological functions. We found that these connected genes tend to be in physical proximity at the chromatin level in the nucleus. We show that the network can be used to predict the biological function and subcellular localization of a protein, and to elucidate the function of a disease-gene. Specifically we discovered that the gene granulin precursor GRN), whose mutations cause frontotemporal lobar degeneration, is involved in lysosome function. We have developed an online tool (http://netview.tigem.it) for querying and exploring the gene regulatory network."
2943201018	Black flies (Simuliidae) are important biting insects and vectors of diseases agents of humans and livestock. Thus, understanding the taxonomy and biodiversity of these insects is crucial for control and management of these diseases. In this study, we used mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase I sequences to examine genetic diversity of three human-biting and possible vector black fly taxa; the Simulium asakoae species-complex, S. chamlongi and S. nigrogilvum. High levels of genetic diversity (>3.5% intraspecific genetic divergence) were found in all three taxa. Phylogenetic analyses indicated that the S. asakoae complex can be divided into seven groups with the largest group consisting of specimens from Thailand, Malaysia and Myanmar. This group most likely represents true S. asakoae. The remaining haplotypes formed groups with conspecific haplotypes or with other closely related species. Among these groups, one including S. monglaense and another including S. myanmarense suggest that certain specimens identified as S. asakoae most likely belong to those species. Therefore, they constitute new locality records for Thailand and also represent new records of anthropophily. Members of S. chamlongi are not monophyletic as its clade also included S. hackeri. A median joining network revealed strong geographic associations of the haplotypes of S. nigrogilvum suggesting limitation of gene flow. Because this species occurs mainly in high elevation habitats, low land areas could present a barrier to gene flow.
2240756607	Increasing grain yield and protein are important wheat breeding goals; however, the simultaneous improvement of both traits is complicated by a strong negative correlation and genotype by environment interaction (G×E). A recurrent selection program (RSP) was initiated to produce germplasm which combines both high yield-potential and increased protein content for the northern wheat-growing region of Australia. Diallel crossing amongst 10 cultivars (7 high yield and 3 high quality cultivars), followed by random mating amongst the F1s were used to produce the founding segregating population. Two years of multi-environment trails were conducted in the GRDC Northern Grain Region (NR) for each of the initial (RSA0) and first (RSA1) cycles of recurrent selection. Data from the two cycles were analysed to evaluate the genetic gain achieved over the two cycles of selection, based on three potential selection strategies. Selection based on yield or protein only increased selected trait but reduced the other traits. However, application of selection based on yield, protein and yield-adjusted protein simultaneously increased both yield (7.76% and 1.74% for RSA1 and RSA0 respectively) and protein (0.26% and 0.79% for RSA0 and RSA1 respectively).
2240756800	Marked increase in shoot length and number of branchlets was observed upto fourth and third month, respectively. Dry matter content stabilized between second and third month (June–July). Stability for N and Mg content were noted in 3 and 4–6 months old shoots, respectively. P content stabilised during 1–3 months, whereas potassium and calcium in 2–3 months old shoots. All these nutrients were found stabilized at middle position of the shoot. To assess N, P, P, Ca and Mg status of an aonla tree, 3–4 months old branchlets should be sampled from middle position of shoots.
3149565144	Objective To construct a recombinant adenovirus vector carrying the full-length sense and antisense cyclin B1 cDNA of human,and to investigate the influence of the recombinant adenoviruses on the cultured human cervical carcinoma cell line HeLa. Methods The recombinant adenovirus vectors were constructed by homologous recombination technique. The recombinant adenoviruses were packaged and amplified in 293A cells. Then the recombinant adenoviruses were used to infect HeLa cells. The influence was determined by cell counting and flow cytometry. Results The HeLa cells infected with antisense recombinant adenovirus exhibited significant cell apoptosis and growth inhibition compared to the normal HeLa cells and the cells infected with sense recombinant adenovirus. Conclusion Recombinant adenoviruses vectors containing the full-length sense and antisense cDNA of human cyclin B1 is successfully constructed,which has laid a foundation for further studies on its anticancer functions.
2055240440	The genusMicrosphaera has been considered to be derived from sectionErysiphe of the genusErysiphe by a single event. Cleistothecial appendages are the most distinct difference between the two genera and have an important role for overwintering. To understand the phylogenetic relationship betweenErysiphe sectionErysiphe andMicrosphaera more precisely, phylogenetic trees were constructed using the nucleotide sequences of the rDNA ITS region from 11Erysiphe (sectionErysiphe) and 16Microsphaera taxa. The phylogenetic trees indicated the close relationship between the two genera. However, the generaErysiphe (sectionErysiphe) andMicrosphaera did not group into separate monophyletic lineages; instead, they formed several small clusters that were mixed together. This result suggests that the differentiations of the genera occurred two or more times independently. This also supports the idea that appendage morphology does not always accurately reflect the phylogeny of the powdery mildews because the morphology of appendages may evolve convergently under the selection pressure of their particular biotopes (host plants).
2055240532	Development of the Caenorhabditis elegans foregut (pharynx) is regulated by a network of proteins that includes the Retinoblastoma protein (pRb) ortholog LIN-35; the ubiquitin pathway components UBC-18 and ARI-1; and PHA-1, a cytoplasmic protein. Loss of pha-1 activity impairs pharyngeal development and body morphogenesis, leading to embryonic arrest. We have used a genetic suppressor approach to dissect this complex pathway. The lethality of pha-1 mutants is suppressed by loss-of-function mutations in sup-35/ztf-21 and sup-37/ztf-12, which encode Zn-finger proteins, and by mutations in sup-36. Here we show that sup-36 encodes a divergent Skp1 family member that binds to several F-box proteins and the microtubule-associated protein PLT-1/τ. Like SUP-35, SUP-36 levels were negatively regulated by UBC-18–ARI-1. We also found that SUP-35 and SUP-37 physically associated and that SUP-35 could bind microtubules. Thus, SUP-35, SUP-36, and SUP-37 may function within a pathway or complex that includes cytoskeletal components. Additionally, SUP-36 may regulate the subcellular localization of SUP-35 during embryogenesis. We carried out a genome-wide RNAi screen to identify additional regulators of this network and identified 39 genes, most of which are associated with transcriptional regulation. Twenty-three of these genes acted via the LIN-35 pathway. In addition, several S-phase kinase-associated protein (Skp)1–Cullin–F-Box (SCF) components were identified, further implicating SCF complexes as part of the greater network controlling pharyngeal development.
2055240539	Genomic Imprinting is defined as the expression of only one allele of a gene in a parent-of-origin specific way, its disturbance leads to an altered expression associated with specific syndromes. As the identification of multilocus methylation defects made the locus specific association questionable, molecular tests aiming on the identification of multiple loci should be implemented in routine diagnostics as they allow an efficient molecular characterization of patients with ambiguous phenotypes.
2055240558	Purpose: We investigated the clinical implications of biallelic loss of PTEN in clear cell renal cell carcinoma and whether PTEN biallelic loss would induce p53 dependent cellular senescence.Materials and Methods: Data were obtained using the CGDS-R package from the TCGA data set kirc_tcga_pub. PTEN allelic status was classified into 3 groups, including biallelic PTEN loss (homozygous deletion or combined heterozygous deletion and mutation), monoallelic PTEN loss (heterozygous deletion or mutation) and absent allelic loss. Univariate and multivariate overall survival analysis was performed. TP53 allelic loss and mean expression of genes related to p53 dependent cellular senescence were compared.Results: Of 416 patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma 11 (2.6%) had biallelic PTEN loss and 69 (16.6%) had monoallelic loss. PTEN allelic loss was associated with late tumor stage and high histological grade. Patients with biallelic loss showed worse overall survival after adjusting for age and AJCC tumor s...
2055240568	Abstract The in vitro activities of carumonam and eight comparative antimicrobial agents were studied. MICs of carumonam were less than or equal to 0.5 microgram/ml for 91% of members of the family Enterobacteriaceae and less than or equal to 16 micrograms/ml for 88% of nonfermenters; gram-positive cocci and anaerobic bacteria were resistant. Combinations of carumonam with piperacillin, nafcillin, or clindamycin were usually indifferent, although synergy between carumonam and piperacillin was observed with 20 (13%) of 155 strains.
2055240694	Addition of neurons to cultures of non-neuronal cells derived from quail embryonic dorsal root ganglia causes a 2.5-fold increase in the proportion of cells that express the glial marker Schwann cell myelin protein (SMP) when compared to cultures devoid of neurons. This effect is mediated by BDNF because incubation with a trkB immunoadhesin that sequesters BDNF, but not with trkA or trkC immunoadhesins, abolishes this stimulation. This neuronal activity can be mimicked by treatment with soluble BDNF that stimulates specifically the conversion of SMP-negative glial cells into cells that express this phenotype. That BDNF is the endogenous neuron-derived factor affecting glial development is further supported by the observation that BDNF is extensively expressed in developing sensory neurons of the avian ganglia both in vivo and in vitro, but not by the satellite cells. These results show for the first time a paracrine role for neuronal BDNF on differentiation of peripheral glial cells. This effect of BDNF is likely to be mediated by the p75 neurotrophin receptor because: (1) p75 immunoreactive protein is expressed by a subset of satellite cells; (2) neutralization of p75 abolishes the BDNF-induced stimulation; (3) a treatment of non-neuronal cell cultures with equimolar concentrations of either soluble NGF or NT-3 also affects the proportion of cells that become SMP-positive. Whereas NGF stimulates the acquisition of this glial antigen to a similar extent as BDNF, NT-3 inhibits its expression, suggesting that distinct neurotrophins signal differentially through p75. These findings also suggest that the definitive phenotype of peripheral glia is determined by a balance between positive and inhibitory signals arising in adjacent neurons.
2055240713	Intoxicacao cronica por cobre foi observada em um rebanho de 20 ovinos no municipio de Franca, Sao Paulo.

2055240775	Metabolic networks are among the most widely studied biological systems. The topology and interconnections of metabolic reactions have been well described for many species. This is, however, not sufficient to understand how their activity is regulated in living organisms. These descriptions depict a static set of possible chains of reactions, with no information about the dynamic activity of reaction fluxes. Cyclic structures are thought to play a central role in the homeostasis of biological systems and in their resilience to a changing environment. In this work, we present a methodology to help investigating dynamic fluxes associated to biochemical reactions in metabolic networks. We introduce an algorithm for partitioning fluxes between cyclic and acyclic sub-networks, adapted from an algorithm initially developed to study fluxes in trophic networks. Using this algorithm, we analyse three metabolic systems: the central metabolism of wild type and a deletion mutant of Escherichia coli, erythrocyte metabolism and the central metabolism of the bacterium Methylobacterium extorquens. This methodology unveils the role of cycles in driving and maintaining metabolic fluxes under perturbations in these examples, and may be used to further investigate and understand the organisational invariance of biological systems.
2055240858	The genus Noctitrella Gorochov, 1990 is recorded to China for the first time. A new species is described and illustrated, N. denticulata sp. nov. (CHINA: Yunnan). A key to and a distribution map of the known species of this genus in the world are presented.
2055240881	Abstract Acid gels incorporating protein isolates from Vicia faba beans have an off-flavour. The odour intensity of this characteristic was quantified on a category scale, and the effect on off-flavour of different methods of protein isolation or addition of flavours to the gels was quantified. Analysis of variance (during the protein isolate production) shows that the defatting or isoelectric washing of the bean flour, or the addition of a strawberry aroma concentrate to the gel itself, caused a significant reduction in the off-flavour of the acid bean protein gel. A combination of defatting and isoelectric washing of the bean flour lead to the greatest reduction in off-flavour.
2055240889	Metallothioneins chelate metals and consequently may be a control point of metal homeostasis. Homologous to type 3 metallothioneins, TcMT3 cDNA was identified in the Cd/Zn hyperaccumulator, Thlaspi caerulescens. TcMT3 amino acid sequence showed modifications in the Cys positions when compared with its Arabidopsis orthologue. A structural model established that the MT3 carboxyterminal domain is similar to the beta domain of animal metallothioneins and predicts a smaller cavity to chelate metals for A. thaliana than for T. caerulescens. Functional testing in yeast and Northern blot analysis added further evidence for adaptative variations of MT3 for the maintenance of Cu homeostasis in a metal hyperaccumulator.
2055240900	Resume La classification des stades ovariens demeure encore imprecise. L'ultrastructure du follicule basal a permis de resoudre ce probleme. Du sixieme au huitieme jour de la vie adulte de l'abeille ouvriere, la longueur de l'ovariole ne depasse guere 2 mm. Les ovocytes basaux des stades 1 et 2 se caracterisent par la presence de nombreuses plages de granules cernees par les cylindres dilates du reticulum endoplasmique granulaire. Ces cylindres decondensent les granules proteiques et les globules lipidiques, generant ainsi des corps multivesiculaires. L'ovocyte basal, au troisieme stade de developpement, mesure 0 , 35 ± 0 , 05 mm de long. Ce stade de la fin previtellogenese se caracterise par l'apparition, dans l'ooplasme, de nombreux tubules, dont l'extremite dilatee constitue un lysosome. Des le debut de la deuxieme semaine, la vitellogenese commence. Le stade 4 est defini par l'apparition, dans l'ooplasme, des granules vitellins en relation avec les formations tubulaires. Au bout de 14 a 16 jours de la vie adulte, 25 ± 7 , 1 % des abeilles ouvrieres atteignent la fin de la vitellogenese, ou stade 5. L'ovariole, d'environ 7 mm de long, comporte 11 follicules.

2055240991	Abstract Responses of nematode assemblages and soil function (short-term decomposition) in restored and degraded soil following an experimental disturbance (copper, chloroform, heat or drying) were monitored for 65 days. We tested the hypotheses: restoration enhanced the measured soil parameters; stability to disturbance was higher in degraded soil due to induced tolerance; and whether changes of the nematode assemblage were related to soil function. Even after disturbance, greater nematode abundance (>150 vs >10 per 100 g soil), nematode richness ( D ′ > 1.0 vs >0.4) and function (>1.0 vs >0.05 mg CO 2  g −1 week −1 ) were maintained in restored than in degraded soil, respectively. An increase in nematode enrichment index (from 60 to >75) following all disturbances was attributed to the relatively high abundance of tolerant fungivores. The greater stability of the nematode structure index in degraded soil following heat and drying (120% and 125% respectively of the control), than in restored soil (90% and 30% of control) was due to a higher proportion of tolerant omnivores and carnivores. Thus some higher trophic level nematodes, with high c–p values, were tolerant to disturbance. However, stability of function was greater for restored than degraded soil, with a reduction over time in the degraded soil regardless of disturbance type. The differences in the responses of nematodes and soil function to disturbance suggest that nematodes could provide complementary insights into soil stability.
2055241026	Identification of genes that regulate clonogenicity of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) cells is hindered by the difficulty of isolating pure populations of cells with defined proliferative abilities. By analyzing the growth of clonal siblings in low passage cultures of the cell line OCI/AML4 we resolved this heterogeneous population into strata of distinct clonogenic potential, permitting analysis of the transcriptional signature of single cells with defined proliferative abilities. By microarray analysis we showed that the expression of the orphan nuclear receptor EAR-2 (NR2F6) is greater in leukemia cells with extensive proliferative capacity than in those that have lost proliferative ability. EAR-2 is expressed highly in long-term hematopoietic stem cells, relative to short-term hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells, and is downregulated in AML cells after induction of differentiation. Exogenous expression of EAR-2 increased the growth of U937 cells and prevented the proliferative arrest associated with terminal differentiation, and blocked differentiation of U937 and 32Dcl3 cells. Conversely, silencing of EAR-2 by short-hairpin RNA initiated terminal differentiation of these cell lines. These data identify EAR-2 as an important factor in the regulation of clonogenicity and differentiation, and establish that analysis of clonal siblings allows the elucidation of differences in gene expression within the AML hierarchy.
2943202334	We found evidence of infection and shedding of Leptospira serovars Ballum and Canicola in the Andean fox (Lycalopex culpaeus) in Chile. We used PCR to demonstrate the presence of Leptospira DNA and microagglutination tests to identify serovars.
2943202337	A whole genome of Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV–P) Thai strain was cloned. Seven complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of subgenomic fragments encompassed the whole genome of PRSV–SMK5 isolate. The PRSV-SMK5 genome was synthesized by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) using primers designed from unique sites of restriction enzymes in the genome. The sizes of the PCR products ranged from 493 to 2,706 nucleotides (nts). Each fragment was cloned into the pGEM® –T easy plasmid vector to verify the sequence. The confirmed plasmids were used as templates for over lapping PCR and sequentially cloned into pCass2 plant expression vector. The transcription of PRSV genome was driven by Cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and terminated by CaMV terminator. Two fulllength cDNA clones of PRSV-SMK5 isolate, which were designated as pCF17_7 and pCF17_8, were obtained. Each clone showed 10,358 nts in length with 35 nts of an artificial poly(A) tail and containing both 5´ and 3´ non-coding regions consisting of 85 and 206 nts, respectively. A polyprotein of 3,343 deduced amino acids was encoded from 10,032 nts. Both plasmids, pCF17_7 and pCF17_8, were infectious and showed the PRSV typical symptoms at 21 days after mechanical inoculation on papaya seedlings. The in vivo transcribed RNAs in the plant sap were confirmed by RT–PCR, serological detection of PRSV coat protein and PRSV particles were also observed under immuno electron microscopy.
2943202423	RESUMO; O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a reacao de seis cultivares de girassol (BRS 323, BRS 321, M 734, BR G 43, AGUARA 04 e AGUARA 06), submetidas ao estresse por deficit hidrico em casa de vegetacao. Os tratamentos foram dispostos em cinco blocos casualizados. O estresse por deficit hidrico foi aplicado quando as plantas apresentaram a sexta folha completamente expandida, sendo cada cultivar submetida a duas condicoes hidricas: i) deficit hidrico, com supressao total da irrigacao e ii) manutencao da capacidade de campo, com irrigacao diaria e suficiente para saturar o substrato contido nos vasos. Foram avaliados os parâmetros de crescimento MSPA (materia seca da parte aerea), MSR (materia seca das raizes) e relacao MSR/MSPA. Alem disso, foram determinadas a fotossintese liquida (A), a condutância estomatica ao vapor de agua (gs) e o conteudo de clorofila pelo indice SPAD. Os resultados foram submetidos a analise de variância (ANOVA), teste F e comparadas pelo teste de Snott-Knott a 5% de probabilidade. Foi observado o efeito negativo do estresse por deficit hidrico para todas as variaveis de crescimento analisadas. A fotossintese e condutância estomatica tambem foram afetadas em funcao do estresse. As cultivares BRG 43 e AGUARA 04 foram as que apresentaram maior sensibilidade ao estresse, enquanto AGUARA 06, BRS 321 e M 734 mostraram melhor adaptacao. ABSTRACT: The aim of this study was to evaluate six sunflower cultivars (BRS 323, BRS 321, M 734, G BR 43, AGUARA 04 and AGUARA 06), submitted to drought stress under greenhouse conditions. The treatments were arranged in five randomized blocks. The drought stress was applied when plants showed sixth fully expanded leaf. Each cultivar was submitted under two water conditions: i) water deficit, with total suppression of irrigation and ii) maintenance of field capacity, with daily irrigation sufficient to saturate the substrate. The growth parameters SDW (shoot dry weight), RDW (root dry weight) and RDW/SDW ratio were evaluated. Moreover it was determined photosynthesis (A), stomatal conductance (Gs) and the chlorophyll content by SPAD index. The results were submitted to analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the means compared by Snott-Knott test at 5% of probability. According to results negative effect of drought was detected for all plant growth parameters. The photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were also negatively affected by drought stress. Cultivars BRG 43 and AGUARA 04 were more sensitivity to stress, while the cultivars AGUARA 06, BRS 321 and M 734 showed better adaptation in stress conditions.
2240756957	Pygmy backswimmers, pleids, can be common in aquatic habitats with stagnant or slow-moving water that is rich in vegetation.  They are small bugs, usually less than 3.5 mm in length and confine themselves to the vegetation in which they hide and where they prey on mosquito larvae and other small arthropods (Schuh and Slater 1995).  The family is represented by 37 species in three genera: Plea, confined to the Old World; Neoplea confined to the New World; and Paraplea , the largest and most widely distributed genus (Schuh and Slater 1995).
2240757767	We investigated regulatory mechanisms for leukotriene C4 generation by rat basophilic leukemia-1 (RBL-1) cells. When RBL-1 cells were preincubated with or without retinoic acid (RA) for 16 hours and stimulated with calcium ionophore A23187, the cells under the former condition produced larger amount of LTC4 than the latter cells. Such the enhanced LTC4 production was significantly inhibited by up to 93.5% in the presence of DEX.In the cell free system, the lysates of RA-preincubated cells showed higher LTC4 synthase activity than the control cell lysates. In the presence of DEX, such the induction of LTC4 synthase activity was significantly inhibited by up to 66.8%. This discrepancy of inhibition between the intact and cell free systems was attributed to additional inhibition of phospholipase A2 activity by DEX (26.4%) .These results indicate that the production of LTC4 is regulated at a level of LTC4 synthase. The regulation and the induction of new LTC4 synthase activity by RA and its inhibition by DEX may operate as an important regulatory mechanism for LTC4 synthesis in allergic and inflammatory disorders.
2055241062	Background  Deletion of the distal short arm of chromosome 1 occurs in 25–35% of primary neuroblastomas, and a putative tumor suppressor gene has been mapped to a consensus region of deletion at 1p36.2–36.3. Indirect evidence suggests the presence of an imprinted neuroblastoma suppressor gene within this region, as well as an additional nonimprinted, proximal suppressor gene, inactivation of which correlates with MYCN amplification.    Procedure  To test this hypothesis, we performed 1p loss of heterozygosity (LOH) studies on a series of neuroblastomas for which parental DNA had been collected. PCR-formatted polymorphic markers were used to determine the size of the 1p deletion and the parental origin of the deleted 1p homologue.    Results  Twenty-six neuroblastomas with 1p LOH were evaluated. Twenty-four had MYCN amplification, and of these, 15 demonstrated loss of the paternally inherited 1p. Two neuroblastomas with a single copy of MYCN were evaluated and both had deletion of the paternally inherited 1p, with one case exhibiting a small terminal deletion. In addition, we have reviewed 49 previously reported neuroblastomas where 1p LOH data and the parental origin of the deleted 1p homologue were available.    Conclusions  Analyzed together, these 75 neuroblastomas demonstrate random deletion of parental 1p homologues (P = 0.30). Further, tumors with smaller deletions (breakpoints distal to D1S201 or D1S7) showed a random loss of the parental 1p homologues (P = 0.59), contrary to the expected preferential maternal 1p deletion if an imprinted suppressor gene mapped to this region. However, 19 tumors with 1p LOH and single copy MYCN had deletion of the maternal 1p homologue preferentially (P = 0.02), which does not exclude the possibility that loss of an imprinted suppressor gene plays a role in this subset.

2055241079	Abstract The time-optimal control problem for a predator-prey system with intraspecies competition among the preys is considered. The controls are pesticides or insecticides that act on the preys or the predators. The optimal control is synthesized and the dependence of the response time on the parameters of the problem is analysed. The time-optimal control problem for a predator-prey system without intraspecies competition has been previously studied for the Lotka-Volterra model [1] and for the Mono model [2].
2055241175	No systematic classification of fish-pathogenic vibrios has been accomplished previously despite the use of serological, physiological, and genetical classification systems. In this study, a comparative 16S rRNA analysis of 34 strains (representing seven species) of fish-pathogenic vibrios was performed. The 16S rRNA sequences were obtained by using reverse transcriptase. Nearly complete sequences were obtained for nine strains. On the basis of the results of this analysis, the remaining strains were investigated by analyzing selected stretches containing a total of 560 nucleotides. With the exception of a few strains, including ATCC 43313 (serovar O9), our comparative 16S rRNA analysis confirmed that strains preliminarily identified as Vibrio anguillarum were phylogenetically closely related. Strains of V. anguillarum could be divided into groups, with the main group containing serotype O1 and O2 strains isolated from Atlantic salmon, rainbow trout, turbot, cod, and saithe. The other distinctive group was represented by type strain NCMB 6. This strain was nearly indistinguishable from the type strains of Vibrio ordalii and Vibrio damsela on the basis of the 16S rRNA stretches compared. The results of a comparative 16S rRNA analysis justified the status of Vibrio salmonicida as a distinct species. Originally, this species was characterized biochemically as a very homogeneous species. However, two strains, which were isolated from diseased halibut and from the intestines of healthy cod, could not be distinguished from V. salmonicida strains phylogenetically, although they differed from the original species description in several phenotypic traits. Our results indicate that V. salmonicida and Vibrio fischeri form a cluster that is clearly separated from the cluster that includes V. anguillarum.
2055241313	Recent studies revealed that inflammatory processes might play an important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson's disease (PD). We hypothesized that genetically determined differences in the immune response, especially in anti- and pro-inflammatory cytokines production might influence the risk for the development and/or onset of sporadic PD. In the present study, we investigated the genetic polymorphisms of the IL10 (-1082 and -519) and TNF (-308) genes in relation to the risk of PD, and their associations with age of PD onset in a group of 316 patients, divided into two subgroups: Group 1: patients with early onset PD (EOPD), i.e. before 50 years of age (102 patients), and group 2: patients with onset of PD after 50 years of age comprising 214 subjects. Control samples were obtained from 300 randomly selected healthy individuals from the same geographical region with no signs of Parkinsonism as evaluated by a neurologist. PCR-RFLP methods were used for genotyping. No statistically significant differences between PD patients and controls were found in the frequency of a single locus of IL10 promoter. We found TNF -308A allele significantly more frequent in EOPD patients compared to the controls (p=0.007). The overrepresentation of the A allele was reflected by a significant increase in AA homozygous individuals in EOPD patients compared to the controls (p=0.0021). The results from our study revealed that the TNF -308AA genotype might increase the risk of early onset of PD.
2055241315	Pea (Pisum sativum L.) is grown widely throughout China and has undergone natural selection throughout its agricultural range over 2,000 years. Here we characterize collection site habitats to develop an understanding of the key selection pressures likely to be imposed by each environment to facilitate the investigation of specific adaptation. We characterized 240 collection sites of 529 pea landraces, across 25 provinces and 3 municipalities of China comprising the main pea cropping regions for climatic variables. Multivariate analyses showed that collection sites tended to cluster along geographic and abiotic stress clines. Spring sown sites and winter sown sites were clearly separated into 6 and 7 habitat type clusters respectively. In addition, regions which experience extreme abiotic stresses of frost, drought and high temperature in the reproductive period for pea landraces, were identified as targets for germplasm to be tested for respective tolerances to these stresses.
2055241355	Despite the increasing claims that structural complexity in agroforestry plantations is a key variable for enhancing bird biodiversity, few studies have experimentally manipulated the understory component of structural complexity. Here, we examined the impact of removing understory vegetation from oil palm plantations on the richness and abundance of birds in eastern Guatemala, testing if bird richness and abundance are positively affected by the presence of understory vegetation. Oil palm plantations with understory hold more bird richness and abundance than those lacking it. The experimental removal of this vegetation, equivalent to a reduction in complexity, decreases bird richness but not abudance. Our analysis shows clear effects of vegetation removal on bird richness, such that removal reduces richness and abundance to levels found in areas without understory. Hence, leaving or implementing structural complexity within plantations could satisfy the current need of making commodity production a cleaner industry, fulfilling both, the production of highly demanded commodities and the conservation of biodiversity in productive landscapes. Oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) is one of the most rapidly expanding crop in tropical regions, representing the major cause of loss of natural forests and of the decline of endangered species in several countries. Enhancing understory vegetation might reduce such negative effects. This is one of the few experimental tests about how a component of the vegetation and structural complexity of plantations affects birds.
2055241427	Les virus a ARN sont responsables de maladies graves telles que la grippe, la dengue, l’hepatite C, la rougeole ou la bronchiolite des nourrissons. Ils representent egalement une menace emergente en raison des echanges internationaux et des bouleversements ecologiques lies aux activites humaines. Notre comprehension des mecanismes cellulaires qui controlent la replication virale a fortement progresse ces dernieres annees, et il apparait que des composes capables de cibler la cellule hote, plutot que le virus lui-meme, pourraient inhiber un large eventail de virus a ARN. Ainsi, differents laboratoires prives et universitaires sont en quete de molecules stimulant la reponse antivirale innee des cellules hotes. Une strategie interessante consiste a rechercher des molecules induisant l’expression des ISG (interferon-stimulated genes), lesquels constituent un vaste ensemble de genes antiviraux actives en particulier par les interferons de type I. Pour atteindre cet objectif, nous avons mis au point un test phenotypique base sur des cellules humaines transfectees avec un gene rapporteur luciferase sous controle d’un element de reponse aux interferons (ISRE). Ce systeme a ete utilise pour cribler une chimiotheque d’environ 54 000 composes. Parmi les molecules selectionnees, nous avons montre que le compose DD264 stimule la reponse immunitaire innee dans les cultures cellulaires, et presente une activite antivirale a large spectre. En recherchant la cible de ce compose, nous avons montre qu’il inhibe la voie de biosynthese de novo des pyrimidines, et notamment la quatrieme enzyme de cette voie metabolique, la dihydroorotate deshydrogenase (DHODH). Ainsi, nos resultats etablissent de facon surprenante un lien fonctionnel nouveau entre la voie de biosynthese des pyrimidines et la reponse innee antivirale.
2055241434	Summary Objectives HIV-infected subjects on antiretroviral therapy often fail to normalize the CD4/CD8 ratio despite CD4 count normalization. We aimed to analyze the biological significance of this finding. Methods Cross-sectional analysis in 20 HIV-infected subjects on stable triple-ART, plasma HIV RNA 350 cells/mm 3 . Laboratory measurements included T-cell activation (HLADR + , CD38 + ) and senescence (CD57 + ), lipopolysaccharide (LPS), sCD14 and the HIV latent reservoir (number of latently infected memory CD4 cells carrying replication-competent virus). Results CD4/CD8 ratio was positively correlated with CD4 nadir ( r  = 0.468, p  = 0.038) and accumulated ART exposure ( r  = 0.554, p  = 0.0011), and negatively with viral load before ART initiation ( r  = −0.547, p  = 0.013), CD4 + HLADR + CD38 + T-cells ( r  = −0.428, p  = 0.086) and CD8 + CD57 + T-cells ( r  = −0.431, p  = 0.084). No associations with LPS, sCD14 or HIV latent reservoir were found. After the multivariate analyses, the CD4/CD8 ratio remained independently associated with CD4 + HLADR + CD38 + T-cells and CD8 + HLADR + T-cells. Conclusions In our study in subjects on suppressive ART the CD4/CD8 ratio was independently associated with T-cell activation. Our results must be confirmed in larger studies, as this parameter might be a useful clinical tool to identify subjects with ongoing immune activation despite long-term viral suppression.
2055241449	Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus causes one of the most important flaviviral infections of the human central nervous system in Europe and Asia. In recent years the rate of TBE infection has been raising and the virus has been spreading to new areas. Currently, the diagnosis of TBE is based on detection of specific antibodies in patients' sera which appear as late as about 2 weeks post-infection. For a timely diagnosis of TBE virus infections and epidemiological studies, a TBE virus-specific reverse transcription quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR) followed by pyrosequencing was developed. The assay is based on one degenerated primer pair detecting all three human-pathogenic TBE virus subtypes with a detection limit of 10 copies. Even though primers and probe are highly degenerated, the assay is specific for TBE virus species and detects all subtypes with a comparable sensitivity. Furthermore, TBE virus RT-qPCR could be carried out as one-step or two-step assay. RT-qPCR can be followed by pyrosequencing which allows a rapid subtyping of TBE viruses. For detection purposes an internal control to monitor RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and amplification is included. In summary, the method is sensitive, highly specific and easy-to-handle tool for the detection and differentiation of TBE virus in the early phase of illness or in TBE host animal species and ticks.
2055241465	In vitro, and possibly in vivo, hemoglobin polymerization and red blood cell sickling appear to be widespread in codfish. In this article, we show that the hemoglobins of the two Arctic fish Lycodes reticulatus and Gadus morhua also have the tendency to polymerize, as monitored by dynamic light scattering experiments. The elucidation of the primary structure of the single hemoglobin of the zoarcid L. reticulatus shows the presence of a large number of cysteyl residues in α and β chains. Their role in eliciting the ability to produce polymers was also addressed by MALDI-TOF and TOF-TOF mass spectrometry. The G.morhua globins are also rich in Cys, but unlike in L. reticulatus, polymerization does not seem to be disulfide driven. The widespread occurrence of the polymerization phenomenon displayed by hemoglobins of Arctic fish supports the hypothesis that this feature may bea response to stressful environmental conditions.
2055241512	Psychrobacter species are considered to be opportunistic human pathogens. We report here the isolation of a circular DNA molecule, MSSI1.162, from a serum sample taken from a multiple sclerosis patient during relapse. This isolate is distantly related to known Psychrobacter species and their plasmids.

2240757868	Summary  The history of Wisteria frutescens (L.) Poir. is discussed, with particular reference to those associated with its discovery in South Carolina, its transmission to Europe, and its initial cultivation in England and the Dutch Republic. A brief appraisal is given of those natural historians associated with the species in the interconnected worlds of medicine, botany, botanical art and horticulture in the early 18th century whose efforts enabled the Carolina kidney bean tree to be discovered, described and distributed. A description of Wisteria frutescens, with a key to the two varieties, is provided. A lectotype is chosen for the name Glycine frutescens var. magnifica Herincq and neotypes are selected for the names Diplonyx elegans Raf. and Thyrsanthus floridana Croom.
2240758229	Twenty genotypes of chickpea were evaluated for variability in nodulation and nitrogen uptake in a nitrogen deficient soil under rainfed condition. Wide variations in nodule number, dry weight of nodules and N uptake were found among genotypes. Genotypes with higher nodule number and nodule dry weight showed higher shoot dry matter. Nitrogen content in plants showed little variability but nearly 33 per cent variability was found in total N uptake. Among the twenty genotypes studied, ICC-4958 and IPC-54-94 were found to be high N accumulating genotypes.

The detailed morphological characters together with illustrations, diagnostic comparisons and habitat etc. are presented.
2240758793	Abstract not available for EP0623146Abstract of corresponding document: WO9315112A method of interfering with the interaction and/or function of alpha 1-antichymotrypsin (ACT) and Alzheimer's beta -protein and, as a result, reducing the adverse side effects associated with formation of a complex comprising the two or with activity of the complex components. In one embodiment, the subject invention relates to methods of interfering with formation of a specific complex between ACT and beta -protein. In another embodiment, the present invention relates to methods of inhibiting the function of the components of the ACT- beta -protein complex. In particular, it relates to methods of inhibiting the function of beta -protein, particularly enzymatic activity, such as esterase (cholinesterase) or protease activity. Both methods are useful in treating or preventing the effects of complex formation or of the enzymatic activity of the beta -protein and, thus, provide a potential method of treating or preventing Alzheimer's disease, Down's syndrome or normal aging. Compositions and compounds useful in the method are also the subject of this invention.

2055241747	Penilpidia desbarresi sp. nov. was collected in the Desbarres Canyon at a depth of 525 m, off the southeastern coast of insular Newfoundland, eastern Canada. The new species differs from the type species Penilpidia ludwigi (von Marenzeller, 1983) in having larger middle spines on arched rod-type ossicles on the dorsum and by having the lobe around the posterior body end formed by six pairs of very small tube feet. Penilpidia desbarresi sp. nov was photographed in situ and sampled on a single occasion in July 2007. This gonochoric species (1� 2 cm long) was found on a muddy substrate and individuals were aggregated, reaching a density of 50 ind. m � 2 . Preliminary evidence points to brooding, which would be a first for the family Elpidiidae. Penilpidia ludwigi, not recorded for more than 100 years after its first description, is re-described.
2055241783	Abstract An instream viewing facility was used to determine whether brook trout Salvelinus fontinalis or rainbow trout Salmo gairdneri show hierarchical dominance in slow- and fast-flow stream habitats. Nine trials with interspecific pairs of wild immature fish matched for length (mean fork length, 13.7 cm) were conducted in each flow regime. In the slow-flow habitat, brook trout dominated rainbow trout in five of the six trials in which dominance was established. No species advantage was observed in the fast-flow habitat; each species achieved dominance four times. Dominant fish, regardless of species or flow, initiated most of the aggressive behaviour and gained weight whereas subordinates lost weight. We suggest that the demonstrated dominance of brook trout in slow flows may be related to the species' preference for lentic habitats in natural stream environments and that this phenomenon may affect species segregation.

2055241854	Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are among the most widely prescribed drugs, primarily for treatment of arthritis. NSAIDs can have two effects independent of their anti-inflammatory action. In the stomach and small bowel long term NSAID consumption can lead to ulceration, whereas in the colon NSAID use can regress existing tumours. In this review, we hypothesise that NSAID-induced damage occurs predominantly by promoting apoptosis, involving a number of mechanisms depending on the type and the redox state of the cell. In addition to inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, this includes interfering with glucose metabolism through both arms of the pentose phosphate pathways and energy production via glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation. Shifting the cellular balance from proliferation to apoptosis is probably the most important outcome by which NSAIDs exhibit their differing actions. Understanding how these different pathways can be reconciled and their contribution to the balance between cell birth and cell death is the challenge for the future. The pentose phosphate pathways may provide a pivotal point for understanding links between factors which alter proliferative activity (e.g. COXs), provide energy metabolism (particularly aerobic and anaerobic metabolism of glucose), and change the redox state of the cell leading to apoptosis.
2055241896	Calorie restriction (CR) is a non-genetic manipulation that reliably results in extended lifespan of several species ranging from yeast to dogs. The lifespan extension effect of CR has been strongly associated with an increased level and activation of the silent information regulator 2 (Sir2) histone deacetylase and its mammalian ortholog Sirt1. This association led to the search for potential Sirt1-activating, life-extending molecules. This review briefly outlines the experimental findings on resveratrol and other dietary activators of Sirt1.
2055241941	"The study of problems of fertilization and early development is of obvious importance for advance in our basic understanding of the manner of initiation of the development of a new individual. Such study is also of obvious importance for practical purposes relating to the control of fertility in man and other organisms, qualitatively as well as quantitatively. In addition, problems of fertilization represent general biological problems of specific interactions between cells, of stimuli to proliferation, and of the ""turning-on"" of specific biochemical and biophysical activities. Their study may thus be expected to contribute to other areas of biology and to be furthered by results of investigations in seemingly diverse fields of biology. The present author has reviewed this subject in a number of earlier articles (Tyler, 1955a, b, 1957, 1959, 196 1c, 1962b, 1963) dealing with biological and chemical investigations and with the practical problems of fertilitycontrol (Tyler, 1961a, b, 1964b, c; Tyler and Bishop, 1963). An approach that may be termed immunochemical, or alleloplastological, has been emphasized and the relation to general biological problems indicated some time ago (Tyler, 1940, 1946) in an Auto-Antibody Concept of the structure. growth, and differentiation of cells. This was an early formulation of the template basis for macromolecular syntheses in cells, which currently serves to guide investigations of problems of biosynthesis in developing organisms as well as other biological systems. These concepts, as they apply to specific stimulation of cell-proliferation and of destructive types of interaction between cells, have served also as a basis for the formulation of theories of carcinogenesis and of aging (Tyler, 1960, 1962a; Walford, 1964). This article presents a survey of some of the investigations of fertilization and early development, and includes details of some current investigations that have not been previously published. Earlier studies, where pertinent, are dealt with more summarily. The subjects under primary consideration are problems of the initiation of development explored by electronmicroscopy, by immunochemical methods, and by methods of protein biosynthesis."
2055241953	Abstract Yield performances of apical shoot cuttings of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) obtained from crops raised 2 or 4 times recurrently through vines, were compared with those obtained from tubers. The recurrent use of vines as planting-material did not show any marked variation in market-grade tuber yield, but it significantly decreased vine yield and increased weevil infestation in tubers. Cultivars ‘Cross-4’, ‘RS-5’ differed significantly in performance
2055241965	Twenty species of Indian marine crabs were experimentally infected with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), via the oral route and intramuscular injection, to determine their viral susceptibility. We determined that 16 species (Calappa philargius, Charybdis annulata, C. lucifera, Doclea hybrida, Grapsus albolineatus, Halimede ochtodes, Liagore rubronaculata, Lithodes maja, Matuta miersi, Paradorippe granulata, Parthenope prensor, Philyra syndactyla, Podophthalmus vigil, Portunus sanquinolentus, Scylla serrata and Thalamita danae) were susceptible and 4 (Atergatis integerrimus, Charybdis natator, Demania splendida or Menippe rumphii) were refractive at 50 d post-infection (p.i.). The presence of WSSV in these crabs was confirmed by PCR tests, histology and bioassay. WSSV was found in the gill, heart, eyestalks, striated muscle and cephalothoraxic tissue. The 4 WSSV-refractive species represent potential reservoirs or carriers of WSSV.
2055241999	Mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) regulate critical signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis. Recent studies have shown that a novel class of scaffold proteins mediates the structural and functional organization of the three-tier MAPK module. By linking the MAP3K, MAP2K and MAPK into a multienzyme complex, these MAPK-specific scaffold proteins provide an insulated physical conduit through which signals from the respective MAPK can be transmitted to the appropriate spatiotemporal cellular loci. Scaffold proteins play a determinant role in modulating the signaling strength of their cognate MAPK module by regulating the signal amplitude and duration. The scaffold proteins themselves are finely regulated resulting in dynamic intra- and inter-molecular interactions that can modulate the signaling outputs of MAPK modules. This review focuses on defining the diverse mechanisms by which these scaffold proteins interact with their respective MAPK modules and the role of such interactions in the spatiotemporal organization as well as context-specific signaling of the different MAPK modules.
2055242053	Endophytes are mutualistic symbionts within healthy plant tissues. In this study we isolated Bacillus spp. from seeds of several varieties of maize. Bacillus amyloliquifaciens or Bacillus subtilis were found to be present in all maize varieties examined in this study. To determine whether bacteria may produce antifungal compounds, generally lipopeptides in Bacillus spp., bacterial cultures were screened for production of lipopeptides. Lipopeptides were extracted by acid precipitation from liquid cultures of Bacillus spp. Lipopeptide extracts from Bacillus spp. isolated from Indian popcorn and yellow dent corn showed inhibitory activity against Fusarium moniliforme at 500μg per disk. Using MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry we detected the presence of antifungal iturin A, fengycin and bacillomycin in these isolates. PCR amplification also showed the presence of genes for iturin A and fengycin. B. subtilis (SG_JW.03) isolated from Indian popcorn showed strong inhibition of Arabidopsis seed mycoflora and enhanced seedling growth. We tested for the induction of defence gene expression in the host plant after treatment of plants with B. subtilis (SG_JW.03) and its lipopeptide extract using RT-qPCR. Roots of Indian popcorn seedlings treated with a suspension of B. subtilis (SG_JW.03) showed the induction of pathogenesis-related genes, including PR-1 and PR-4, which relate to plant defence against fungal pathogens. The lipopeptide extract alone did not increase the expression of these pathogenesis-related genes. Based on our study of maize endophytes, we hypothesize that, bacterial endophytes that naturally occur in many maize varieties may function to protect hosts by secreting antifungal lipopeptides that inhibit pathogens as well as inducing the up-regulation of pathogenesis-related genes of host plants (systemic acquired resistance).
2943204083	"Cryptosporidium is a waterborne apicomplexan parasite typically infecting the upper gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals. Infection in immunocompetent hosts can cause acute self-limiting diarrhoeal symptoms, although in infants and the immunocompromised, infection can be life threatening. The infective stage of the parasite survives in the environment as a hardy cyst/spore or 'oocyst'. These oocysts have high resistance to disinfectants, enabling them to survive for long periods in various environments whilst remaining infective. The nature and characteristics of these ""spores"" remain elusive, and further research into oocyst composition is necessary to enable the development of effective water treatment methods and medical prophylaxis, for which options are currently limited. This project describes a novel method for live imaging and peak force quantitative nanomechanical property mapping of Cryptosporidium spp. oocysts using atomic force microscopy (AFM). Applying this method, data on the surface topography and deformation characteristics of Cryptosporidium parvum oocysts has been acquired and analysed to identify physiological characteristics of live oocyst of the species C. parvum, both in air and in a near native liquid environment. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and fluorescence microscopy were used for comparison between imaging methods, and previous reports. This work will enable investigations into live Cryptosporidium spp. oocyst structure, composition, and mechanical properties in unprecedented depth. In turn these capacities can be used to inform and advance our understanding of host specificity and excystation control, and to develop new methods for treatment and eradication of the parasite, all areas of vital importance to progress research towards combating this significant disease."

2240759086	The Wild Cane Assembly at the Sugarcane Breeding Institute, Coimbatore, conists i.nter alia of over 300 variants of Saccharurn s#ontaneurn, collected from the entire Indian sub-continent. On the basis of detailed studies made on these clones, about 30 possessing desirable morphological, chemical and disease-resistant characters have been selected as possible genetic stocks3. In order to assess and, if possible, to improve their breeding value, some of these stocks were selfed, and studies were on the transmissibility of characters which distinguish them. Preliminary indications obtained as a result of progeny tests of 15 genetic stocks are reported in this
2240759168	Information on quality characteristics of forage species help the range managers to select a suitable grazing program that minimizes the damages to vegetation. Water Soluble Carbohydrates (WSC) -the main photosynthetic products- are stored in various plant parts and are more likely to be consumed when plants require them. In order to investigate the changes of WSC in distinguishable organs in three phenological stages, samples were taken from Bromus tomentellus and Festuca ovina in three phenological stages (vegetation, flowering and maturity). Samples of roots and aerial parts were taken for both species using a completely randomized factorial arrangement-based design with the phenological stages regarded as the first factor and herbage parts as the second factor with 5 replications. Higher WSC values were observed in the leaves of B. tomentellus (4.6%) and F. ovina (4.5%) in maturity and flowering stages, respectively. Maximum WSC values of roots were obtained in B. tomentellus (3.2%) and F. ovina (3.5%) at vegetation and maturity stages, respectively. It was suggested that range utilization in a phenological stage might be managed in which forage species can withstand the defoliation without severe reserve depletion. Results indicate that except flowering stage in B. tomentellus, WSC was increased with the increase of panicle weight in the maturity stage and there was an inverse relationship between plant components and WSC content percent in the other phenological stages.
2240759568	Maize breeding on scientific basis began at the onset of 20th century. Maize breeding at the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops began in 1938. Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops has created 218 maize hybrids, 80 of which have been registered in foreign countries and 13 are on the EU list. Genetic variability in maize is enough for future progress in maize breeding. Hybrid NS 640 is the most wide-spread hybrid in Serbia. The highest yield so far of 18,640 kg ha-1 was gained with NS 6010. This is our recommendation for 2010: early FAO 300: NS 300 and NS 3014. FAO 400: NS 4015 and NS 444 ultra. FAO 500: NS 5043, NS 5010, NS 510, NS 540 and NS 542. FAO 600: NS 6010, NS 6030, NS 640, Zenit, Radan and NS 6102. FAO 700: Tisa, NS 7020 and NS 770. New NS maize hybrids are recommended for the first time for large production. They are a new generation of NS maize hybrids: NS 4030, NS 5020, NS 5032, NS 640 Ultra, NS 6040, NS 6060 and NS 6043. Their seeds will be distributed by NS representatives.
2240759724	ACTG2 Inhibits Growth and Is Epigenetically Repressed in Small Intestinal Neuroendocrine Tumors
2240759839	To ascertain whether the presence of lungs per se , or some other physiological feature, might account for the differences in oxygen consumption and stamina previously observed in an interspecific comparison (Full et al . 1988), individual salamanders ( Ambystoma tigrinum ) were exercised on a treadmill before and after their nares and mouth had been sealed. After airway closure, animals behaved normally and suffered no mortality. Airway closure reduced the routine MO2 (rate of oxygen consumption) by an average of 47% in six of seven individuals. Animals with open airways increased their MO2 2-to 4-fold during locomotion at 11 cm s−1, and did not fatigue in 22 min of exercise at this speed. Animals with closed airways managed only small increases above the routine MO2 during exercise at 11 cm s−1, and none could sustain activity for more than 10 min. Thus, exclusively skin-breathing Ambystoma cannot increase cutaneous gas exchange to compensate for the elimination of pulmonary and buccopharyngeal respiration; locomotor stamina suffers accordingly. Small salamanders can apparently increase cutaneous gas exchange during activity, although large salamanders cannot, because cutaneous diffusing capacity and the resting oxygen requirement approach one another with increasing body size; the skin of large salamanders apparently has a limited scope for aerobic activity.

2943204717	Euglossini bees are considered pollinators of a wide variety of plants in the Neotropical region, but little is known about their floral preferences. In this study, we identified the botanical species used as pollen and nectar sources by three Euglossa species ( Euglossa cordata , Euglossa townsendi, and Euglossa securigera ) using pollen residue found in brood cells from trap nests installed in an urban fragment in Sao Luis, Maranhao, Brazil. In 14 analyzed Eg. cordata nests, 23 pollen types were observed, in 7 Eg. townsendi nests, 10 pollen types were observed, and in 1 nest of Eg. securigera, 6 morph types were identified. Solanum (Solanaceae), Zanthoxylum (Rutaceae), Mimosa pudica (Fabaceae), and Chamaecrista (Fabaceae) pollen types were common to all three bee species. Principal components analysis showed 83.04% variability on the first two axes, demonstrating substantial similarity among the samples. Solanum , Mimosa pudica, and Zanthoxylum were the principal components in the ranking. Larger diversity values (mean = 0.80) in some samples indicate that the species gathered resources in a heterogeneous manner; this resembles the findings of other studies of Euglossa . In general, the bees exhibited overlapping niches with regard to the most abundant pollens in the nests, but the females showed individual plasticity when gathering the floral resources.
2943204942	Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) can be transferred through the placenta and breast milk to the developing human offspring, carrying immediate and delayed health risks. We sought to evaluate potential levels of exposure to POPs during critical windows of development: pregnancy and lactation. Two cross-sectional studies were carried out in villages of the states of Sonora and Sinaloa in Mexico, where high levels of POPs have been detected through environmental and human monitoring. POPs were measured in the serum of 60 fertile-aged women in the first study. Breast milk POPs concentrations were measured in a pooled sample of 50 women in the second study. This may be the first study in Mexico to report breast milk dioxins’ and furans’ concentrations. The most commonly detected POPs in serum were: pentachloroanisole (71 %), PCB 205 (43 %), tetrachlorobenzenes (17-33 %), p,p’DDE (21 %), and toxic lindane by-products α-HCH or β-HCH (15 %). Congeners of furans and dioxins with the highest concentrations in milk were 2,3,4,7,8-PeCDF (3.42 pg/g) and OCDD (33.0 pg/g), respectively. The ∑ PCDD/Fs found in this study was lower than in other studies. Both serum and milk samples of fertile-aged women suggest that p,p’DDE and PCB 180 are prevalent local POPs, among others, that may reach developing embryos and infants via the placenta and lactation. These results can serve as a starting point to determine potential levels of exposure to POPs in the most vulnerable stages of life and to evaluate concentration trends in the process of eliminating these compounds.
2943205085	Abstract New enzymes often evolve by amplification and divergence of genes encoding enzymes with a weak ability to provide a new function. Experimental studies to date have followed the evolutionary trajectory of an amplified gene, but have not addressed other mutations in the genome when fitness is limited by an evolving gene. We have adapted Escherichia coli in which an enzyme’s weak secondary activity has been recruited to serve an essential function. While the gene encoding the “weak-link” enzyme amplified in all eight populations, mutations improving the new activity occurred in only one. This beneficial allele quickly swept the amplified array, displacing the parental allele. Most adaptive mutations, however, occurred elsewhere in the genome. We have identified the mechanisms by which three of the classes of mutations increase fitness. These mutations may be detrimental once a new enzyme has evolved, and require reversion or compensation, leading to permanent changes in the genome.
2943205096	The purpose of this experiment is to evaluate the growth and yield of cassava under  intercropping with several genotypes of sorghum. This research was conducted in Sukanegara Village, Tanjung Bintang, South Lampung district in March 2017–March 2018, dry matter analysis conducted in the laboratory of Agronomy, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Lampung, Bandar Lampung. The experiment was set in RCBD (Randomized Completely Block Design) with three replications. Its homogeneity of variance was tested with Bartlett test and data’s additivity of will be tested with Tukey’s test. If these two assumptions are fulfilled then continued with analysis of variance (anova). Since factors in anova are significant then the comparison of treatment means were analyzed by LSD’s test (Least Significant Difference) at the 5% level. The results showed that cassava under intercropping with sorghum genotypes of P/F-5-193-C and GH 5 tend to show a slower growth than the cassava planted in intercropping with other sorghum genotypes in this research. While, on the results of the component, the cassava plant in intercropping with P/F-5193-C and GH 5 produce number of tuber fewer than when in the  intercropping with other sorghum genotypes. Instead, the resulting starch content higher. Keywords: cassava, intercropping, and sorghum
2943205496	Bacteriophages draw scientific attention in medicine and biotechnology, including phage engineering, widely used to shape biological properties of bacteriophages. We developed engineered T4-derived bacteriophages presenting seven types of tissue-homing peptides. We evaluated phage accumulation in targeted tissues, spleen, liver and phage circulation in blood (in mice). Contrary to expectations, accumulation of engineered bacteriophages in targeted organs was not observed, but instead, three engineered phages achieved tissue titres up to 2 orders of magnitude lower than unmodified T4. This correlated with impaired survival of these phages in the circulation. Thus, engineering of T4 phage resulted in the short-circulating phage phenotype. We found that the complement system inactivated engineered phages significantly more strongly than unmodified T4, while no significant differences in phages' susceptibility to phagocytosis or immunogenicity were found. The short-circulating phage phenotype of the engineered phages suggests that natural phages, at least those propagating on commensal bacteria of animals and humans, are naturally optimized to escape rapid neutralization by the immune system. In this way, phages remain active for longer when inside mammalian bodies, thus increasing their chance of propagating on commensal bacteria. The effect of phage engineering on phage pharmacokinetics should be considered in phage design for medical purposes.
2240760035	Programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) and ligand (PD-L1) provide an important escape mechanism from immune attack, and blockade therapy of these proteins show promising clinical benefits in many types of cancer. PD-L1 can be induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-γ), hypoxia, or toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated pathways that confer adaptive immune resistance, or upregulated by oncogenic signals leading to constitutive expression and resulting in intrinsic immune resistance. The PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint blockade, which targets regulatory pathways in T cells to overcome immune resistance, is correlated to PD-L1 expression pattern and the presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). Meanwhile, immunogenic mutation loads show significant response to checkpoint blockade, which is probably due to PD-1/L1 status and TIL content. Finally, the clinical strategies to design effective checkpoint-targeting immunotherapies are based on the classification of inducible/constitutive expression of PD-L1 and the presence of TILs.

2240760613	A detailed examination of the types of the poorly known nominal gymnotiform apteronotid species Sternarchus mariae Eigenmann & Fisher and Sternarchus jurubidae Fowler, both described from localities in the Trans-Andean region of Colombia, was performed. This investigation resulted in a redescription of the former species, as well as a reevaluation of specific status of the latter. It is concluded that both taxa are valid within the currently recognized genus Apteronotus . The presence of A. eschmeyeri , A. mariae and A. magdalenensis supports the previous hypotheses of the Rio Magdalena Basin as a region of endemism.
2240760740	The object of the invention was to select strains of the Trichoderma species having an inhibitory activity against a large spectrum of lignopathogenic and phytopathogenic fungi, the development of a fungicide and a process for using the same. Thanks to the selection of 3 new strains of Trichoderma: Trichoderma sp. LC1, LC2 and LC3, fungi have been selected which totally inhibit the most important wood destroyers according to EN 113. In addition, they inhibit important phytopathogenic fungi. A fungicide based on the use of the 3 Trichoderma strains is applied by spraying, dipping or in an immobilized form. When applied on wood, an incubating phase is also part of the invention.
3149566204	The grey squirrel is an invasive alien species introduced to Great Britain in the late 19 Century and to Northern Italy during the early 20 Century. As well as displacing the native European red squirrel, grey squirrels cause significant impact to trees and woodlands through bark-stripping activity, and are implicated in the decline of woodland bird populations. In Britain, eradication is no longer an option at a regional scale, but fertility control offers a possible approach to minimise negative impacts. The cholesterol mimic DiazaCon has been successfully used to inhibit reproduction in some species as it reduces cholesterol available for steroid reproductive hormone synthesis. Results are presented from enclosure studies investigating whether DiazaCon would reduce cholesterol levels enough and for a sufficient period to reduce fertility in female grey squirrels.

3149566262	Ferritin is an iron storage protein that plays a key role in the processes of physiology and pathology.In the present study,the authors reported the ferritin gene from abalone Haliotis diversicolor supertexta,which we named hds-ferritin.The full-length of hds-ferritin cDNA consisted of 879 bp with an ORF encoding a 171 amino acids.Amino acid sequence analysis revealed that hds-ferritin shared highly homology with other species.Real time PCR and western blot analysis showed that hds-ferritin was distributed ubiquitously in abalone tissues and had the highest expression level in digestive glands,but its transcripts are not modified remarkably by the stimulation with LPS.The recombinant protein was successfully expressed in Escherichia coli BL21（DE3）,and the titre of anti-ferritin antibody was about 1：14 000.The effects of ROS and RNS on ferritin were analyzed in the present study.The results showed that H2O2 played an important role in decreasing hds-ferritin,however NO cation appeared to have a protecting effect on H2O2-medied reduction of hds-ferritin.
2240761038	Cyclosporin A is a widely used immunosuppressive drug that selectively inhibits cell-mediated immune reactions. The discovery of Cyclosporin A has been critical to the success of transplantation therapies and distinguishing cellular mechanisms of the immune response. This PharmSight will focus on a novel application of Cyclosporin A in modulating the fate and behavior of Neural Precursor Cells (NPCs), a cell population consisting of stem cells and their progeny, which provide the basis for adult neurogenesis. Our recently published data indicate that Cyclosporin A, at therapeutically relevant concentrations, acts directly on NPCs to enhance their survival both in vitro and in vivo. The action of Cyclosporin A on NPC survival is promising for the development of regenerative strategies which aim to utilize NPCs to repair and regenerate damaged or diseased Central Nervous System (CNS) tissue. Herein, we present an overview of our recent findings, and further demonstrate the ability of Cyclosporin A to enhance the survival of regionally distinct NPC populations, as well as consider the potential mechanisms by which Cyclosporin A may mediate this effect. Finally we conclude by speculating on the potential therapeutic benefits of Cyclosporin A in the treatment of CNS injury and disease.

2943205859	Abstract The main goal of this study was to characterize the expression patterns of genes which play a role in mitochondrial DNA biogenesis and metabolism during the maturation of bovine oocytes with different meiotic competence and health. Meiotically more and less competent oocytes were obtained separately either from medium (MF) or small (SF) follicles and categorized according to oocyte morphology into healthy and light-atretic. The four oocyte categories were matured and collected after 0, 3, 7, 16 and 24 h of maturation. Either total RNA or poly(A) RNA were extracted from oocytes and the expression of selected mitochondrial translational factors (TFAM, TFB1M, and TFB2M), MATER, and Luciferase as external standard was assessed using a real-time RT-PCR. The level of TFAM, TFB1M and MATER poly(A) RNA transcripts significantly decreased during maturation in both healthy and light-atretic MF and SF oocytes. On the other hand, the level of TFB2M poly(A) increased during maturation in healthy and light-atretic SF oocytes, in contrast to MF oocytes. The abundance of TFAM total RNA was significantly higher after maturation than that before maturation in all oocyte categories. However, no differences in TFB1M and TFB2M total RNA were found in any oocyte categories. It can be concluded that the gene expression patterns differ in maturing bovine oocytes in dependence on their meiotic competence and health. The TFAM and TFB1M poly(A) RNAs are actively deadenylated at different meiotic stages but TFB2M poly(A) RNA remains elevated in light-atretic less competent oocytes until the completion of meiosis.
2943206076	PURPOSE: Human parechoviruses (HPeVs), particularly type 3, can cause severe neurological disease and neonatal sepsis in infants. HPeV3 lacks the receptor-binding motif arginine-glycine aspartic acid (RGD), and is proposed to use a different receptor associated with severe disease. In contrast, HPeV1, which contains the RGD motif, is associated with mild disease. Rapid characterization of the presence/absence of this motif is essential for understanding their epidemiology and differential disease profiles. Current HPeV typing assays are based on partial capsid genes and often do not encompass the C-terminus where the RGD region is localized/absent. In addition, these assays lack sensitivity to enable characterization within low viral-load samples, such as cerebral spinal fluid. METHODOLOGY: We developed a highly sensitive HPeV CODEHOP PCR, which enables typing of parechoviruses directly from clinical samples while generating a complete VP1 gene, including the C-terminus. RESULTS: The assay was HPeV-specific and has a sensitivity of 6.3 TCID50 ml-1 for HPeV1 and 0.63 TCID50 ml-1 for HPeV3. Analysis of the complete VP1 gene in comparison to partial VP1 fragments generated by previously published PCRs showed homologous clustering for most types. However, phylogenetic analysis of partial VP1 fragments showed incongruent typing based on the 75  % homology classification rule. In particular, the strains designated as type 17 were found to be either type 3 or 4 when using the (near-) complete VP1 fragment. CONCLUSION: While enabling sensitive characterization of HPeVs directly from clinical samples, the HPeV CODEHOP PCR enables the characterization of RGD and non-RGD strains and correct HPeV typing based on the complete VP1.
2943206403	Monogeneans are a diverse group of parasites that are commonly found on fish. Some monogenean species are highly pathogenic to cultured fish. The present study aimed to determine the in vitro anthelmintic effect of silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) against adults and eggs of monogeneans in freshwater using Cichlidogyrus spp. as a model organism. We tested two types of AgNPs with different synthesis methodologies and size diameters: ARGOVIT (35 nm) and UTSA (1–3 nm) nanoparticles. Damage to the parasite tegument was observed by scanning electron microscopy. UTSA AgNPs were more effective than ARGOVIT; in both cases, there was a concentration-dependent effect. A concentration of 36 μg/L UTSA AgNPs for 1 h was 100% effective against eggs and adult parasites, causing swelling, loss of corrugations, and disruption of the parasite’s tegument. This is an interesting result considering that monogenean eggs are typically tolerant to antiparasite drugs and chemical agents. To the best of our knowledge, no previous reports have assessed the effect of AgNPs on any metazoan parasites of fish. Therefore, the present work provides a basis for future research on the control of fish parasite diseases.
2943206515	Ischemic stroke (IS) is a complex disease with sex differences in epidemiology, presentations, and outcomes. However, the sex-specific mechanism underlying IS remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to identify key genes contributing to biological differences between sexes. First, we downloaded the gene expression data of GSE22255 from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using R software and related packages. Second, DEGs were separately analyzed by Gene Ontology enrichment and pathways analyses. Third, protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed to further investigate the interactions of DEGs. A total of 123 DEGs were identified between sexes, including 8 upregulated and 115 downregulated genes. In the PPI network, ten key genes were identified, including IL1α, IL1β, IL6, IL8, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL20, CCL4, ICAM1, and PTGS2. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were mainly enriched in biological processes of immune response and apoptotic process, also in pathways of TNF and NOD-like receptor signaling. In conclusion, the above ten genes may have a protective effect on IS females through their direct or indirect involvement in biological processes of immune response and apoptotic process, as well as in TNF and NOD-like receptor signaling pathways. The results of this study may help to gain new insights into the sex-specific mechanisms underlying IS females and may suggest potential therapeutic targets for disease treatment.
2240762020	Summary Studies on the antiviral effects of short peptides of six to 10 amino acids that correspond in sequence to the cyto­ plasmic domains of enveloped virus transmembrane glycoproteins have been extended to include additional kinds of assay in order to determine a site for inhibition of virus replication. Based on these experiments, the antiviral activity previously described for a decapeptide with the influenza virus haemagglutinin HA 2 C-terminal sequence was not specific for influenza virus and the integrity of newly released, extracellular vesicular stom­ atitis virus particles was affected by the peptide. A shortened, six amino acid form of this peptide inactivat­ ed cell-free preparations of influenza, vesicular stomati­ tis and Sindbis viruses and also bound effectively to virus-encoded structural proteins. For this virus-protein interaction, the peptide sequence was highly specific with respect to its hydrophobicity and net ionic charge.

2240762373	Objective: Different cryoprotectants are used for cryopreservation of ovarian tissue in patients at risk of infertility. Ethylene glycol (EG), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and propanediol (PROH) have been chosen as the basic permeable cryoprotectants due to their decreased glass-formation characteristics compared to other cryoprotectants. In the present study, the effects of two different vitrification methods on whole mouse ovarian tissue by the use of a novel staining method (trypan blue) has been evaluated. Methods: Ovaries of 8 day-old NMRI mice were isolated and divided among the control, vitrification 1 (Vit1) and vitrification 2 (Vit2) groups. The Vit1 solution was composed of α-MEM+ 20% FBS + 15% EG + 15% DMSO. The Vit 2 solution was composed of αMEM+ 15% FBS +20% EG + 20% PROH. Vit1 and Vit2 procedures were performed at 4˚C and room temperature, respectively. Warming was performed in α-MEM+ 20% FBS supplemented with 1M sucrose in the Vit1 group and α-MEM+ 15% FBS with descending concentrations of sucrose (1, 0.5, 0.25 M) in the Vit2 group. Control and vitrified warmed ovaries were put in α-MEM supplemented by 0.4% trypan blue for 20 min, and then stained ovaries were fixed in Bouin’s fixative, serially sectioned in paraffin wax and finally quantitatively evaluated under a light microscope. Results: The highest percentage of primordial follicles was observed in the control group. There was a significant difference between the control and Vit1 groups, and between the Vit1 and Vit2 groups (p<0.05). No significant difference was observed in primary and preantral follicles between the control and vitrification groups. Conclusion: Vitrification with EG and PROH are more suitable for preservation of follicle reserves in ovaries. Trypan blue staining is a faster and easier method for evaluation of ovarian tissue.
2240762717	Surfactant protein B (SP-B) is expressed tissue specifically in the lung and is developmentally regulated. To identify genomic regions that control SP-B expression, we analyzed SP-B promoter activity in transgenic mice containing rabbit SP-B 5'-flanking DNA fragments linked to the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter gene. Results showed that whereas the -2,176/+39-bp fragment failed to express CAT, shorter fragments of -730/+39 and -236/+39 bp expressed CAT tissue specifically in the lung. Further deletion of 5'-flanking DNA to -136 bp resulted in no expression of CAT. Immunostaining demonstrated that both -730/+39- and -236/+39-bp regions expressed CAT specifically in alveolar type II and Clara cells. The -236/+39-bp region expressed CAT at a significantly lower level than the -730/+39-bp region. CAT expression in mice containing the -730/+39-bp region was detected in embryonic day 14 lung and attained maximum levels in day 18 lung, indicating that the developmental expression of CAT was similar to that of SP-B. These data show that the DNA elements necessary for cell type-specific expression are located within -236/+39 bp of the SP-B gene. Additionally, these data suggest that the -2,176/-730- and -730/-236-bp regions contain the DNA elements that repress and enhance SP-B gene transcription, respectively.
2943206808	Norcantharidin (NCTD), a demethylated derivative of cantharidin (defensive toxin of blister beetles), has been reported to exhibit insecticidal activity against various types of agricultural pests. However, NCTD applications are limited by its poor water solubility and high dosage requirement. Nanoemulsions have attracted much attentions due to the transparent or translucence appearance, physical stability, high bioavailability and non-irritant in nature. In general, nanoemulsions with small droplet size can enhance the bioavailability of drugs, whereas this phenomenon is likely system dependent. In present study, NCTD nanoemulsions were developed and optimized to evaluate and improve the insecticidal activity of NCTD against Plutella xylostella (Lepidotera: Plutellidae) by a spontaneous emulsification method. Triacetin, Cremophor EL and butanol were selected as the constituents of NCTD nanoemulsions via solubility determination, emulsification efficiency and ternary phase diagram construction. Insecticidal activity of NCTD nanoemulsion was associated with the content of surfactant and cosurfactant: (1) Higher effective toxicity exhibited at Smix (surfactant to cosurfactant mass ratio) = 3:1 that may be associated with the changes in interfacial tension; (2) NCTD nanoemulsion at 3:7 < SOR (surfactant to oil mass ratio) < 6:4 was more effective at lower surfactant level, which was attributed to the relatively slow diffusion rate of NCTD hindering by excess surfactant. Interestingly, nanoemulsions with smaller droplets were not found to be more effective in our study. The optimized NCTD nanoemulsion (triacetin/Cremophor EL/butanol (60/20/20, w/w)) exhibited effective insecticidal activity (LC50 60.414 mg/l, LC90 185.530 mg/l, 48 h) than the NCTD acetone solution (LC50 175.602 mg/L, LC90 303.050 mg/L, 48 h). Spontaneous emulsifying nanoemulsion employed to formulate this poor water-soluble pesticide is a potential system for agriculture application.
2943206830	Abstract Biodiversity is generally believed to be a main determinant of ecosystem functioning. This principle also applies to the microbiome and could consequently contribute to host health. According to ecological theory, communities are shaped by top predators whose direct and indirect interactions with community members cause stability and diversity. Bdellovibrio and like organisms (BALOs) are a neglected group of predatory bacteria that feed on Gram-negative bacteria and can thereby influence microbiome composition. We asked whether BALOs can predict biodiversity levels in microbiomes from distinct host groups and environments. We demonstrate that genetic signatures of BALOs are commonly found within the 16S rRNA reads from diverse host taxa. In many cases, their presence, abundance, and especially richness are positively correlated with overall microbiome diversity. Our findings suggest that BALOs can act as drivers of microbial alpha-diversity and should therefore be considered as candidates for the restoration of microbiomes and the prevention of dysbiosis.
2943207015	Virus susceptibility of 11 varieties of vegetatively propagated petunia against 2 virus strains (TMV-C/U1 and PVYNTN) were examined. Neither resistant nor tolerant varieties of petunia were found. The virus infection of the Petunia genus was examined in Hungary. The most common pathogens were the Tobacco mosaic tobamovirus (TMV) and the Tomato mosaic tobamovirus (ToMV), but the samples also contained Alfalfa mosaic alfamovirus (AMV), Cucumber mosaic ClIC11171014171S (CMV) and Potato Y potyvirus (PVY). Potato X potexvirus (PVX) was isolated in the varieties of trailing petunia for the first time.
2943207126	Within-species variation in genome size has been documented in many animals and plants. Despite its importance for understanding eukaryotic genome diversity, there is only sparse knowledge about the maintenance and evolution of such variation on a population level. Here we study a natural population of the rotifer Brachionus asplanchnoidis whose members differ up to 1.9-fold in genome size, but were still able to interbreed and produce viable offspring. We show that genome size is highly heritable and can be artificially selected up or down, but not beyond a minimum diploid genome size. Analyses of segregation patterns in haploid males reveal that large genomic elements (multiple Mega-Base pairs in size) provide the substrate of genome size variation. These elements explain the short-term evolutionary dynamics of genome size as well as unexpected patterns, like increased genome size variation among inbred lines. Overall, our study explains how intraspecific genome size variation can be maintained in populations and provides a framework for understanding the evolutionary forces that drive changes in genome size on a population level.

2943207564	Abstract A comparative limnological study of the zooplankton communities and their relationship with environmental factors was conducted to test the temporal and spatial changes among lake groups. In our study of four lakes, the lowest gamma (γ) diversity was recorded in January 2017, with a total of 25 zooplankton taxa. The highest γ diversity was recorded in May 2016, with a total of 55 zooplankton taxa. Species turnover in space (β) were from 14.98 to 25.81. Markedly temporal and spatial variations were observed in the zooplankton community. The higher mean cladocera density (57.70 ind. L−1 and 39.85 ind. L−1) was observed in May and August, then decreased gradually with the lowest in January. The mean copepoda density ranged from 8.71 ind. L−1 in January 2017 to 32.04 ind. L−1 in August 2016. The mean rotifera density was significantly higher than that of the other two crustacean zooplankton (p
2943207661	Rotavirus (RV) diarrhea is the major cause of death of millions of children in developing countries besides causing economically significant malady in neonates of many domestic animals. There is a very little information available for the factors which can affect prevalence of Bovine Rotavirus (BRV) in Pakistan. There is a dire need to propagate BRV on cell culture and evaluate the physical and chemical control of RV in effective ways for the betterment of human and livestock welfare. Therefore, the present study aimed to propagate BRV on Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cell line. The screening of the virus was done by using commercially available kit and TCID50 technique. The propagation of BRV was then led to study its inactivity and infectivity potential using different physical and chemical factors. For this reason, 3 physical factors (Temperature, pH and UV light) and 8 chemical disinfectants were used. The virus got completely inactive at a temperature range of 75 to 80oC and 5.00 to 6.00 pH while remained active at 7.04 and 8.00. The virus was inactivated after exposure to 0.5% Virkon®-S within 30 minutes, 0.5% Bromo-Sept after 30 min, and 1.0% surf excel after 30 min Phenol within 60 min at a concentration of 1.0% and 0.6% H2O2 after 30 min proved to be virucidal for the virus. These findings can be helpful for the farmers to keep their farms decontaminated from this virus. Moreover, these results can also be of help in the prevention of the outbreaks that occur in the hospitals.  #These authors contributed equally to this work.
2398627525	Upon removal of nutrients, the amoebae of the cellular slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum differentiate into dormant spores which survive starvation stress. In this study, we demonstrate that half of the actin molecules in the spores are tyrosine-phosphorylated. The phosphorylated actin is distributed around immobile crenate mitochondria and vesicles, as well as in the cytoplasm of the spores. The actin isolated from spore lysates contains phosphorylated and unphosphorylated forms at the same molar ratio as that of the original whole spore lysate. Under actin polymerizing conditions they form actin filaments and then they are completely depolymerized under actin depolymerizing conditions, indicating that tyrosine phosphorylation of actin may not prohibit actin polymerization nor stimulate depolymerization. The phosphorylation levels increase at the end of the culmination stage when spores have matured morphologically and physiologically, and reach maximum levels after an additional 12 hours of development. The levels are stable for 20 days following spore maturation, and decline to undetectable levels within the next 10 days. Spores having high levels of phosphorylation show high viability, and vice versa. Following activation of spores with nutrient medium containing spore germination promoters, the phosphorylation levels quickly decrease with a half-life of about 5 minutes. After 20 minutes spores begin to swell. At this later time, most of the phosphorylated actin already has been dephosphorylated. Also, in heat-activated spores actin dephosphorylation occurs prior to spore swelling. However, addition of phosphatase inhibitors following heat-activation, prevented spore swelling and dephosphorylation of actin. Our data indicate that the high levels of actin tyrosine phosphorylation, specific to the spore stage, may be required for maintaining dormancy to withstand starvation stress. The rapid dephosphorylation of actin leads to a reactivated dynamic actin system which participates in spore swelling, vesicle movement, and mitochondrial shape changes during the spore germination process.
2398627589	OBJECTIVE To confirm the current major diseases and corresponding pathogens of Codonopsis tangshen in Chongqing. METHODS The main cultivation regions of Codonopsis tangshen in Chongqing were systematically investigated, and the pathogens of the obtained specimens were isolated and identified. RESULTS Totally, five fungal diseases in Codonopsis tangshen were identified, including rust disease (Puccinia campanumoeae Pat.), root rot (Fusarium oxysporum Schl.), violet root rot (Helicobasidium mompa Tanaka), powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca codonopsis (Golov.) Z. Y. Zhao), and blight (Septoria codonopsidis Ziling). Currently, the diseases with the serious damage on Codonopsis tangshen included rust disease, root rot and violet root rot. CONCLUSION Rust disease, the severest disease,whose incidence reaches 100%, is an urgent problem waiting to be solved effectively in Codonopsis tangshen cultivation.
2398627645	DNA methylation, a major regulator of epigenetic modifications has been shown to alter the expression of genes that are involved in aspects of glucose metabolism such as glucose intolerance, insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction and other conditions, and it ultimately leads to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Current evidences indicate an association of DNA methylation with T2DM. This review provides an overview of how various factors play crucial roles in T2DM pathogenesis and how DNA methylation interacts with these factors. Additionally, an update on current techniques of DNA methylation analysis with their pros and cons is provided as a basis for the adoption of suitable techniques in future DNA methylation research towards better management of T2DM. To elucidate the mechanistic relationship between vital environmental factors and the development of T2DM, a better understanding of the changes in gene expression associated with DNA methylation at the molecular level is still needed.
2398627819	In vitro maturation of eggs from frozen-preserved tissue would be an important infertility therapy for women, whose eggs have been destroyed during cancer treatment. If there is a risk of presence of malignant cells in the tissue, it cannot be transferred back to the woman. Almost full-sized eggs are obtained in ovarian tissue culture by abolishing inhibition of the activation of ovarian follicles and by adding growth-regulating growth factors and hormones. Their final maturation in the subsequent culture and fertilization will hopefully be successful in the near future.
3149567565	Background The role of ferroptosis in tumorigenesis has been confirmed in previous studies. However, the comprehensive analysis of ferroptosis-related gene (FRG) to study the role of FRG in soft tissue sarcoma (STS) is lacking. Methods RNA sequencing profile of TCGA-SARC cohort and GTEx were used to select differentially expressed FRGs (DEFRGs). Univariate, LASSO, and multivariate Cox analyses were selected to determine overall survival (OS)- and disease-free survival (PFS)-related FRGs. Two prognostic signatures were established and validated in two independent sets from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Finally, the expression of key FRGs were validated with RT-qPCR. Results In total, 198 FRGs (90.4%) were abnormally expressed in STS. Twelve DEFRGs were incorporated in the final signatures and showed favorable discrimination in both training and validation cohorts. Patients in the different risk groups not only showed different prognosis, but also showed different infiltration of immune cells. Two nomograms combining signature and clinical variables were established and the C-indexes were 0.852 and 0.752 for the OS and DFS nomograms, respectively. Finally, the expression of NOX5, HELLS, and RPL8 were validated with RT-qPCR. Conclusion This comprehensive analysis of the FRG landscape in STS revealed novel FRGs related to carcinogenesis and prognosis. These findings have implications for prognosis and therapeutic responses, which revealed potential prognostic biomarkers and promote precision medicine.
3149567621	Polystoma pingbianensis sp. nov. is described as a new species of the Polytomatidae(Monogenea) genera Polystoma parasitic in the urinary bladder of the host Polypedates dugritei David. The host were obtained during Apr. and May in 2002 at Pingbian County (22°56′N, 103°42′E), Yunnan Province, China. The hosts were collected from bushes and water at some marshy area near a slow flowing pool. Holotype and paratypes deposited in the Zoological Research Room of School of Life Science of Yunnan Normal University,Kunming. The preliminary structure and speciality of host of the new species are discussed in this article.The main characteristics and measurements of adults based only on egg producing bladder parasites. Mean total body length 9 428?mm, haptor 0 869?mm×0 784?mm, sucker diameter 434 4?μm and mean haptoral hamulu total length 403 2?μm.The outside lateral intestine completely absence of anastomoses, but 13 14 medial intestinal diverticular branched, extending well beyond mid line and form 1 anastomoses with the opposite diverticular, or form no anastomoses usually. Lateral intestine extending well into haptor and form no diverticula. Ovary is smaller, mean length 711 52?μm and ovary anterior to single testis. Eggs relatively large, mean egg length 306 6?μm, mean egg diameter 164 6?μm.
2943207784	Soil salinity is a major abiotic stress affecting plant growth and yield, due to both osmotic and ionic stresses. JUBGBRUNNEN1 (JUB1) is a NAC family transcription factor that has been shown to be involved in responses to abiotic stresses, such as water deficit, osmotic, salinity, heat and oxidative stress. In Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), JUB1 has been shown to improve plant stress tolerance by regulating H2O2 levels. In the horticultural crop, Solanum lycopersicum cv. Moneymaker (tomato), overexpression of AtJUB1 has been shown to partially alleviate water deficit stress at the vegetative stage. In this study, we investigated the effect of Arabidopsis JUB1 overexpression in salinity tolerance in tomato. In hydroponically grown tomato seedlings, AtJUB1 overexpression results in higher prolines levels and improves the maintenance of water content in the plant under salinity stress. The transgenic tomato plants are more tolerant to salinity stress compared to control lines based on plant biomass. However, at the reproductive stage, we found that overexpression of AtJUB1 only provided marginal improvements in yield-related parameters, in the conditions used for the current work. The combination of improved water deficit and salinity stress tolerance conferred by AtJUB1 overexpression may be beneficial when tomato plants are grown in the field under marginal environments.
2943207801	The common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) is affected by drought, which when occurring during the reproductive stage can significantly affect its morphological and physiological components. The objective of this study was to evaluate the genetic variability in seed yield and its components and phenology of the plant in thermal weather (°Cd) in varieties of beans ‘Flor de Mayo’ and black beans of southern Veracruz, in irrigation and drought under a plastic cover, at the Postgraduate College, Campus Montecillo in spring-summer 2014. In irrigation, the varieties FM M38, FM Sol and FM RMC stood out for presenting higher seed yield (RS), aerial biomass (BMA), harvest index (IC), day to flowering degrees (GDF) and day degrees to physiological maturity (GDMF), while in drought, FM M38 and FM Sol had high values in RS, BMA, GDF and GDMF. Drought decreased RS (42.1%), BMA (31.7%), IC (13.4%), number of pods per plant (VP, 36.5%), seeds per plant (SP, 43.9%), seeds per pod (SV; 10.3%) and individual seed weight (PIS, 16.2%) with respect to irrigation. The RS of the varieties ‘Flor de Mayo’ and black beans, under irrigated conditions, was positively and significantly related to the BMA, the IC and the PIS. Under drought, RS was positively and significantly related to BMA and IC.
2943208096	Gebreegziabher BG, Tsegay BA. 2018. Evaluation of farmers’ knowledge on the rare Abyssinian pea (Pisum sativum var. abyssinicum) landraces of Ethiopia. Biodiversitas 19: 1851-1865. Abyssinian pea (Pisum sativum var. abyssinicum A. Braun) is a rare and problematic taxon requiring evaluation of present farmers’ local knowledge. Cross-sectional data were collected from 444 respondents and analyzed using SPSS software. Descriptive statistics was used; one way ANOVA for significance test of variance and Exhaustive CHAID growth method for predictions. Prediction results showed that the crop requires about two good rains, Nitisol soils and about 21-30 kg ha-1seeding rate. The flowering to maturity time ranges 11∕2 to 21∕2 months depending on the agroecology (highland or lowland), with a yield of about 300-400 kg ha-1on average. The crop distribution is currently limited to three to four districts and sown after other crops are harvested. Major factors hindering its distribution are agro-ecological suitability, lack of intervention and preference of high yielding pea varieties. The crops’ inferiority in yield and pest susceptibility is the main reason for less extensive awareness on the crop. Though inferior in yield and susceptible to pest, farmers still prefer to grow the crop because of its marketability for local exchange and consumption. The core production problems currently remarked by farmers are expensive price of the seed to buy and small land holding.
2943208104	The sequencing of whole genomes and the subsequent annotation of cDNAs revealed that about 20% of human and mouse genes overlap resulting in potential pairs of sense and antisense transcripts. An increasing number of experimentally identified antisense transcripts concur with this predication. Characterization of overlapping transcripts in various species indicates that this form of RNA-mediated gene regulation represents a widespread phenomenon. However, the physiological relevance of natural antisense transcripts remains obscure. Genomic studies suggest that duplex formation between sense and antisense is required for biological function. Antisense transcripts play an established role in imprinting and X-chromosome inactivation and genomic rearrangements as observed in B and T leukocytes. Only a relatively small percentage of the predicted antisense transcripts are related to these biological phenomena that are also related to mono-allelic expression. Consequently, there are at least two categories of natural antisense transcripts that show significant differences with regard to their biological function as well as the potential mechanisms involved.
2943208206	Blood monocytes are present throughout the body. These cells mediate host antimicrobial defenses and are implicated in almost every inflammatory process. It is accepted that monocytes are non-proliferating myeloid cells and their abundance in peripheral tissues depends on the recruitment from the circulation. However, there is emerging evidence that macrophages can be rescued from cell cycle arrest and actively proliferate during infections to increase population density. These findings may contribute to a novel concept that monocytes are not terminally differentiated cells without the capacity to locally proliferate. However, the proliferation of blood monocytes has not been studied so far and the contribution of recruitment versus local proliferation for the presence of Ly6C+ monocytes in inflamed tissues also needs to be defined.. Furthermore, the function of proliferative monocytes during infection and inflammation is unknown. IL-6 is a pleiotropic cytokine that is known to regulate inflammatory processes and play an essential role during bacterial infections. Role of IL-6 in regulation of monocyte accumulation during bacterial infections is also unknown. This thesis demonstrates the proliferative capacity of recruited Ly6C+ monocytes in a murine model of urinary tract infection and in LPS-induced peritonitis. IL-6 trans-signaling was identified as the key pathway that regulates the proliferation of Ly6C+ monocytes in both inflammatory models. Non-proliferating monocytes phagocytized matured neutrophils, whereas proliferating monocytes critically contribute to the defense against infection. These data reveal the process of monocyte proliferation during bacteria infected tissues and identify IL-6 as the key molecule that regulates this proliferation.
3149567852	Abstract Gene expression differences among individuals are shaped by trans-acting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). Most trans-eQTLs map to hotspot locations that influence many genes. The molecular mechanisms perturbed by hotspots are often assumed to involve “vertical” cascades of effects in pathways that can ultimately affect the expression of thousands of genes. Here, we report that trans-eQTLs can affect the expression of adjacent genes via “horizontal” mechanisms that extend along a chromosome. Genes affected by trans-eQTL hotspots in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae were more likely to be located next to each other than expected by chance. These paired hotspot effects tended to occur at adjacent genes that show coexpression in response to genetic and environmental perturbations. Physical proximity and shared chromatin state, in addition to regulation of adjacent genes by similar transcription factors, were independently associated with paired hotspot effects. The effects of trans-eQTLs can spread among neighboring genes even when these genes do not share a common function. This phenomenon could result in unexpected connections between regulatory genetic variation and phenotypes.
2943208620	Toxoplasma gondii is an obligate apicomplexan zoonotic parasite that infects humans and other animals and is responsible for toxoplasmosis. This parasite causes one of the most common parasitic infections in humans worldwide. Toxoplasmosis meets the requirements for a One Health Disease due to its ability to affect the health of human beings as well as domestic and free ranging animals. Integrating human, domestic animal, and wildlife data could better assess the risk and devise methods of control. A first step of such an approach would be the knowledge of the prevalence of parasitosis in humans and animals in selected areas. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the occurrence of Toxoplasma infection in 216 free ranging birds belonging to different genera/species by serology and molecular techniques. Twenty-five out of 216 animals (11.6%) were positive to the immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) with antibody titers ranging from 1/20 to 1/320, and 19 of them (8.8%) also showed a positive PCR for Toxoplasma DNA. The results confirmed the widespread occurrence of Toxoplasma infection in wild birds and serological data were corroborated by molecular results in birds that also had low antibody titers. The knowledge of the wide occurrence of the parasite in game and wild birds should enhance the accurate estimation of the risks in handling, managing, and eating these species with regard to domestic carnivores as well as the impact of viscera and offal in the environment.
2943208637	Lago de Tota basin is currently being impacted by human activities like agriculture, deforestation, large-scale fish farming and monoculture of onion long (Allium fistulosum) with high use of agrochemicals and chicken manure that contaminate runoff to aquatic systems in the largest high mountain lake in Colombia. We implemented toxicity tests to evaluate possible deleterious effects of contaminants on H. attenuata and D. magna, model organisms commonly used in aquatic contamination assessment. Firstly, the organisms were acclimated and toxicity tests were validated in laboratory conditions. Later, water and sediments (elutriates) were evaluated from tributaries of Lago de Tota basin: Hato Laguna, El Tobal, Los Pozos, and Agua Blanca stream, during two contrasting hydroclimatic periods. In addition, pesticides insediments were evaluated with chromatography, spectrometry and ultraviolet detection techniques. Acute toxicity tests showed that H. attenuata was more sensitive than D. magna, as it showed sublethal (Kruskal-Wallis; P < 0.05) and lethal responses to exposure to waters and elutriates from Hato Laguna, El Tobal, and Los Pozos. At least five pesticides not quantified before in the basin were detected in chemical analyses (chlorothalonil, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT y congeners). These results indicate that anthropogenic activities have a potentially negative influence in aquatic communities composition, structure, and function, it´s demand attention in future research.

2943208975	A detailed description of Hydropisphaera heliconiae sp. nov. is presented based on two collections on dead leaves of Heliconia caribea (Heliconiaceae) in Martinique (FWI). The fungus was cultured and sequenced and its placement in the genus Hydropisphaera confirmed by analysis of LSU sequences. This species primarily differs from all known species in having ascomata nearly black when mature and deeply cupulate when dry. The new combination Ijuhya boothii is proposed for a taxon examined during this study that was formerly placed in Hydropisphaera

2398628428	When mature adipocytes are subjected to an in vitro dedifferentiation strategy referred to as ceiling culture, these mature adipocytes can revert to dedifferentiated fat (DFAT) cells. DFAT cells have many advantages compared with adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) and bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs). For example, DFAT cells are homogeneous and could be obtained from donors regardless of their age. Furthermore, DFAT cells also have the same multi-lineage potentials and low immunogenicity as ASCs. As an excellent source of seed cells for tissue engineering and stem cell transplantation, DFAT cells have better prospects in the treatment of many clinical diseases, such as bone defects, neurological diseases, ischemic heart disease and kidney disease. It is necessary to make more intensive studies of DFAT cells. This article summarizes progresses in the immunological characteristics, differentiation ability and potential clinical applications of DFAT cells.
2398628625	Sorghum [ Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] is a major subsistence crop throughout the region of Sahel. With the exception of seeds and labour, no agricultural inputs are in general used in sorghum production since the grain is of a relatively low commercial value and the risk of losing the crop to drought, flooding, etc. is substantial. A meta-analysis of 118 field experiments was carried out to identify conditions in which two protective seed treatments could support a yield increase of sorghum in Burkina Faso. The two treatments were: i) treatment with the pesticide Calthio C (thiram and chlorpyrifos) and ii) treatment with an aqueous extract from the plant clipta alba. Both treatments were found to produce a yield increase (Medians: Calthio C +199 kg ha -1 , P 40% yield increase) were found to carry a comparatively high load of the infectious ascomycetes:  Fusarium equiseti, Macrophomina phaseolina and Curvularia lunata. Key Words : Curvularia lunata, Fusarium equiseti, Macrophomina phaseolina, Sorghum bicolor

The planting method of the honeysuckle can effectively increase the quality and the survival rate of the honeysuckle.
2943210021	The GATA family of transcription factors is implicated in numerous developmental and physiological processes in metazoans. In Drosophila melanogaster, five different GATA factor genes (pannier, serpent, grain, GATAd and GATAe) have been reported as essential in the development and identity of multiple tissues, including the midgut, heart and brain. Here, we present a novel role for GATAe in the function and homeostasis of the Drosophila renal (Malpighian) tubule. We demonstrate that reduced levels of GATAe gene expression in tubule principal cells induce uncontrolled cell proliferation, resulting in tumorous growth with associated altered expression of apoptotic and carcinogenic key genes. Furthermore, we uncover the involvement of GATAe in the maintenance of stellate cells and migration of renal and nephritic stem cells into the tubule. Our findings of GATAe as a potential master regulator in the events of growth control and cell survival required for the maintenance of the Drosophila renal tubule could provide new insights into the molecular pathways involved in the formation and maintenance of a functional tissue and kidney disease.
2943210206	Castanopsis fargesii is a good afforestation plants and various microorganisms play important roles in mediating the growth and ecological functions of this species. In this study, we evaluated changes in microbial communities in soil samples from C. fargesii forests. The phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) biomarker method was used to obtain bacteria, fungi, actinomycetes, gram-positive bacteria (G+), gram-negative bacteria (G−), aerobic bacteria, and anaerobic bacteria to investigate spatiotemporal changes in microbial communities during the growing season. The results show that soil microorganisms were mainly concentrated in the upper 20-cm layer, demonstrating an obvious surface aggregation (P < 0.05). Large amounts of litter and heavy rainfall during the early growing season resulted in the highest PLFA contents for various microorganisms, whereas relatively low and stable levels were observed during other times. The dominant species during each period were bacteria. G+ or aerobic bacteria were the main bacterial populations, providing insights into the overall trends of soil bacterial PLFA contents. Due to the relative accumulation of refractory substances during the later stages of litter decomposition, the effects of fungi increased significantly. Overall, our findings demonstrate that the main factors influencing microbial communities were litter, rainfall, and soil field capacity.
2943210449	The specification and proper differentiation of germ cells ensure the propagation of sexually reproducing species. Studies of a wide range of organisms have uncovered several important, conserved features of germ cell development, including the critical roles played by localized niches and somatically derived systemic cues. The planarian Schmidtea mediterranea is an excellent model to study fundamental aspects of germ cell development. Planarians are well known for their remarkable regenerative abilities and can regenerate whole animals from small tissue fragments. This amazing ability is bestowed by neoblasts, pluripotent somatic stem cells that are maintained throughout the planarian's lifetime. Advances in functional genomic methodologies have made planarians a powerful model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying germ cell development and reproductive maturation. Here we review recent studies that have led to the discovery of several germ cell-intrinsic factors and somatically derived extrinsic signals important for regulating various aspects of germ cell development. In addition to revealing deep conservation of mechanisms that intrinsically regulate germ cells, these studies also uncover an important function for neuroendocrine control of planarian reproduction as well as novel roles for GPCR signaling in the somatic gonadal niche.
2398628990	An experiment consisted three dates of sowing (July 15, August 1 and August 16), three spacing (20 cm x 10 cm, 3o cm x 10 cm and 40 cm x 10 cm) and six fertilizer and seed treatments (Control-without fertilizer and seed treatment with microbial inoculants),recommended dose of fertilizer (RDF) as basal dose (12.5 kgha -1 N and 40 kgha -1 P2O5), seed treated with Rhizobium and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria (PSB), alone and or in combination, seed treated with Rhizobium and PSB + RDF , seed treated with Rhizobium and PSB + RDF as basal dose + Borax spray (100 ppm) at flower initiation in split-plot design with three replications in order to explore the possibility of enhancement of quality seed production in mung bean cv NDM 1 during wet (kharif) 2013. The seed yield and harvest index and their contributing traits namely, number of pods plant- 1 , pod length, number of seeds pod- 1 and 1000 seed weight were decreased significantly as delayed the sowing. Spacing 30 x 10 cm was appeared superior as compared to either 20 x 10cm or 40 x 10 cm. Use of Rhizobium, PSB and Borax had also shown significant advantage over control and or no-inoculation. The treatment comprised seed treated with Rhizobium and Phosphate Solubilizing Bacteria + Fertilizer (12.5 kgha -1 N and 40 kgha -1 P2O5), as basal dose + Borax spray (100 ppm) at flower initiation being applied at 30 cm x 10 cm spacing apart and sown on 15th July may be exploited to realize higher seed yield and harvest index and also to improve seed vigour in the terms of germination, seedling length, vigour index and field emergence of mung bean. Mung bean, being an important pulse crop, is grown in most of tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. It is the third important pulse crop in India, covering an area of 2.86 million hectares, accounting for 12 per cent of the total acreage, but constitutes only 8 per cent of the total pulse production of the country. In spite of its considerable genetic improvement, the yield potentials have not yet been exploited in totality as visualized by its average productivity as low as 4.68 q ha- 1 in India. Inclusion of only quality seed in its cultivation leads to increase 15-20% seed yield. Availability of quality seed of improved variety at reasonable price to the door of real growers is still a big challenge because apart from the genetic constitution, a number of physiological, biochemical and lack of required packages of practices during the critical stages of crop growth have found to be some of the yield barriers of mung bean (1-2).Timely sowing at the proper spacing along with application of recommended doses of fertilizer (3), microbial inoculants (4) and boron foliar spray (5) have been found to cop- up such bottlenecks to a considerable extent in pulses. However, such studies are meagre in mung bean. The present study was therefore undertaken to study the effect of sowing time, spacing, recommended dose of fertilizer, seed treated with Rhizobium and PSB alone or in combination and boron spray prior to flowering leading to the improvement of seed yield and seed quality parameters in mung bean.
2398629138	The Florentine mixed-longitudinal study, concerning data collected during the 70 s , has showed that there are some differences between the growth and the development of our own population and those ones of British children, at the puberty.

2398629262	Balloon catheter denudation of rat carotid artery that results in significant medial damage is followed by marked intimal smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation associated with limited endothelial regrowth. In this report we demonstrate that: (a) SMC of the carotid media, preceding their intimal proliferation, develop a cytoskeletal profile and morphology consistent with a de-differentiated SMC phenotype; and (b) both medial and intimal SMC subsequently revert to a cytoskeletal profile and morphology reflecting incomplete but significant re-differentiation toward normal SMC phenotype. Specifically, early after balloon injury, SMC of the media and those that have migrated into the intima contain decreased amounts of actin, desmin, and tropomyosin and increased amounts of vimentin; moreover, beta-actin becomes the dominant actin isoform, whereas alpha-actin decreases as compared with that found in normal medial SMC. Late after balloon injury, actin is still less abundant, however, desmin, tropomyosin, and vimentin return toward normal values and both medial and intimal SMC again show a predominance of alpha-actin, although the endothelium does not regenerate over the central surface of intimal thickening in this model. The SMC surface to volume ratio significantly decreases early after balloon injury, whereas it is not significantly different late after balloon injury as compared with that of SMC of the normal carotid media. We demonstrate, furthermore that: (c) adjacent luminal SMC are interconnected by gap junctions and develop focal tight junctions, a feature not reported previously to occur in smooth muscle; these cells however do not form any well defined membrane specialization with the leading edge of endothelium, supporting the view that presence of modified SMC on the luminal surface of chronically denuded vessels is not responsible for the cessation of endothelial regrowth.
2398629389	RNA-Seq allows one to examine only gene expression as well as expression of noncoding RNAs, alternative splicing, and allele-specific expression. With this increased sensitivity and dynamic range, there are computational and statistical considerations that need to be contemplated, which are highly dependent on the biological question being asked. We highlight these to provide an overview of their importance and the impact they can have on downstream interpretation of the brain transcriptome.
3149568646	Plant secondary metabolites have always been a focus of study due to their important roles in human medicine and nutrition. We transferred the isoflavone synthase (IFS) gene into soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merr.) using the Agrobacterium-mediated transformation method in an attempt to produce transformed soybean plants which pro- duced increased levels of the secondary metabolite, iso- flavone. Although the trial to produce transgenic plant failed due to unestablished hygromycin selection, transformed callus cell lines were obtained. The induction rate and degree of callus were similar among the three cultivars tested, but light illumination positively influenced the frequency of callus formation, resulting in a callus induction rate of 74% for Kwangan, 67% for Sojin, and 73% for Duyou. Following seven to eight subcultures on selection media, the isoflavone content of the transformed callus lines were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. The total amount of isoflavone in the transformed callus cell lines was three- to sixfold higher than that in control callus or seeds. Given the many positive effects of isoflavone on human health, it may be possible to adapt our transformed callus lines for indus- trialization through an alternative cell culture system to produce high concentrations of isoflavones.
3149568740	Protein kinase C was found to be significantly over-expressed in cancer samples compared to adjacent normal cervical tissues by proteomics in our previous study. The aim of this study was to examine protein kinase C expression and to analyze the expression patterns of protein kinase C isoforms in squamous cervical cancer at the protein levels and their associations with clinical and pathologic factors of squamous cervical cancer. First, Western blotting was used to examine protein kinase C expression in the specimens of tumors and matched adjacent normal tissues which were collected from 12 patients with squamous cervical cancer. Protein kinase C isoforms (α, δ, θ and ζ) expression were then detected by immunohistochemistry in other 43 cases of squamous cervical cancer tissues, 32 cases of corresponding adjacent normal cervical squamous epithelial tissue and 31 cases of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia. Western blot analysis revealed that protein kinase C expression was positive in squamous cervical cancer while it was not expressed in normal cervical tissues. On the other hand, immunohistochemical analysis suggested that, protein kinase C isoforms (α, δ, θ and ζ) expression was significantly higher in squamous cervical cancer compared to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, as well as in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia compared with normal tissues, respectively.High levels of protein kinase C α expression were associated with cellular differentiation(P<0.05). Protein kinase C δ was significantly associated with tumor stage (P<0.05) and protein kinase C ζ was associated with lymphatic metastasis (P < 0.05). These findings indicate that protein kinase C isoforms expression in cervical lesions was associated with carcinogenesis and might play important roles throughout the process of cervical cancer development.
2398629778	Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the treatment of choice for many hematological malignancies. Its efficacy is limited by graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), the leading cause of post-transplant morbidity and mortality. GVHD is mediated by a subpopulation of T cells in the stem cell graft. Ex vivo T cell depletion of all T cells of the graft can prevent development of GVHD but can lead to a delay in immune reconstitution and an increase of potentially lethal opportunistic infections and leukemic relapses. Hypothetically, an approach that enables a selective depletion of the alloreactive donor T cells that cause GVHD while preserving third party (anti-leukemic and anti-microbial) reactivity would be optimal for recipients of HSCT. Our preliminary data demonstrated that an anti-CD25 immunotoxin, which reacts with a cell surface activation antigen, can selectively deplete alloreactive donor T cells activated by non-leukemic recipient white blood cells while preserving the beneficial third-party reactivity in vitro. In this report we describe a method for clinical-scale ex vivo selective depletion of alloreactive donor T cells using the anti-CD25 immunotoxin, RFT5-SMPT-dgRTA. Two logs of alloreactive T cells could be selectively depleted while preserving third party reactivity. This method was reproducible in 10 pre-clinical experiments with 8 HLA-mismatched healthy volunteer pairs and 2 HLA-matched sibling donor/patient pairs.
2398629925	Sex determination in mammals is dependent on the presence of SRY, which codes for a protein with a DNA binding motif (the HMG-box domain). Here we analyze the evolution of SRY among seven genera of New World monkeys belonging to the family Cebidae. Estimates of the number of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitutions indicated the absence of positive selection acting on SRY evolution. The presence of indels at the C-terminus coding region in different genera and species maintained an open reading frame, indicating a selective pressure constraining the evolution of this coding region. Available data on the fertility of natural and captive interspecific hybrids failed to show any relationship between SRY evolution and speciation for the genera herein studied. Our phylogenetic arrangement for Cebidae genera was similar to previous topologies based on mitochondrial and autosomal DNA sequences. This arrangement also corroborated the division of Cebus into two species groups. However, for Callithrix the differences among SRY topology and those derived from autosomal and mitochondrial genes suggested a Y-chromosome ancestral polymorphism.
2398630025	Twenty-two ponies were examined for serum-neutralizing (SN) antibody to equine herpesvirus type 1 and for in vitro lymphocyte transformation in the presence of viral antigen. Six ponies had undetectable levels of neutralizing antibody (titer less than 1:2) and had lymphocytes which did not respond in culture with viral antigen (stimulation index less than 2.0). Four ponies which had SN antibody to equine herpesvirus type 1 did not manifest lymphocyte transformation in vitro. The 12 remaining seropositive ponies had lymphocyte transformation with viral antigen in vitro (stimulation indexes from 2.0 to 23.5). Lymphocyte transformation was specifically suppressed when cells were grown in medium containing autologous serum. The temporal development of in vitro lymphocyte responsiveness and SN antibody in 3 specific-pathogenfree ponies after experimentally induced infection with equine herpesvirus type 1 is described.
2398630062	[Objective] This study was to investigate the effect of VEGF and its receptor Flt-1 mRNA expression in Mongolia sheep umbilical vein endothelial cells by ghrelin antisense inhibition.[Method] Experiments were divided into 4 groups:group I(blank control group);group II(liposome group);group III(SCON group:20 μmol/L sense oligonucleotide);group IV(ASCON:20 μmol/L antisense oligonucleotide).VEGF and its receptor Flt-1 mRNA expression changes were detected by using real-time fluorescence quantitative detection after 24,36 and 48 h.[Result] The expression of VEGF mRNA in group I,group II were insignificantly different at higher expression levels,and did not change significantly with the time;the expression of VEGF mRNA in group III assumed a slight decrease,but there were no significant differences between group I and group II(P0.05),the expression of VEGF mRNA in group IV(antisense oligonucleotide group) decreased significantly(P 0.05);the expression of VEGF receptor FLT-1 mRNA was similar to that of VEGF.[Conclusion] Antisense inhibition ghrelin has a downward effect to the expression of VEGF and its receptor Flt-1 the mRNA.
2398630065	BACKGROUND: It has been described that an exposition of males to chemical substances may significantly impoverish quality and quantity of produced spermatozoa. The aim of our study was to test whether the polluted air in the Teplice district has negative effects on the quality of sperm of males living in this district. METHODS AND RESULTS: 325 males 18-year-old living in the Teplice district and in the control district of Prachatice were tested. Samples were taken in 1992 and 1994, always at the end of winter and in autumn. According to WHO laboratory manual for investigation of the human sperm, basic parameters were determined: volume of the semen, pH, motility, number and morphology of spermatozoa. In selected groups of males the frequency of aneuploidia of spermatozoa was also examined. Examination of aneuploidia was done using three color fluorescence in situ hybridisation with satellite DNA proves specific for X, Z and 8 chromosomes. Logistic regression was used for the data analysis and Odd's Ratio was estimated (OR's). OR's was found for the morphology of spermatozoa (4.1 and 10.1 for medium and high exposition respectively), for the head morphology (6.1 and 4.1) and in the percentage of motile spermatozoa (9.8 and 3.5). More intensively exposed males had higher frequency of disomy in chromosomes X (p = 0.012), XY (p = 0.01), and Y (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Bio-indicators of toxic and genetic impairment have shown lower quality of sperm in males in Teplice district.
2398630307	The Onchocerciasis Control Program of the World Health Organization is carrying out an extensive screening program in a search for new larvicides to be used for control of Simulium damnosum s.l. Emphasis has been given to finding a pyrethroid and a carbamate to supplement the organophosphates currently in use. These chemicals with differing modes of action, together with Bacillus thuringiensis H-14, are being used in an attempt to cope with the development and spread of resistance to the organophosphates temephos and chlorphoxim.
2055242183	Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces phospholipase C (PLC), a heat-labile hemolysin. Histopathological analysis of PLC-treated mice revealed that the primary target organs involved in PLC-induced toxicity were the liver and kidney. Mice treated i.v. with PLC demonstrated significant tubular epithelial necrosis of the kidney with hematuria, while when given i.p. they exhibited hepatonecrosis with cellular infiltration. Splenomegaly was also a consistent finding. Results from in vitro studies indicate that PLC is toxic for mouse peritoneal cells and human leukocytes.
2055242200	Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a well-known perfluorinated compound (PFC), and its toxicological impact is currently of worldwide concern. In this study, we sought to evaluate the potential biological effects and modes of action of PFOA in a range of physiologically and developmentally related phenotypes in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. The results clearly indicated that the toxic effects of PFOA at the organismal level were associated with the developmental status of the organism, with larvae being most sensitive to this chemical. Except for the decreased weight of both sexes and the reduced longevity of male adults, PFOA had a robust effect on larval development, as determined by reduced body volume, aberrant foraging behavior, molting arrest, and polyphasic lethality. Remarkably, nutrient supplementation of the diet efficiently rescued the lethal effect of high PFOA concentrations on larval development. This result indicated that PFOA probably competed with nutritional components, leading to a disruption of the metabolic pathways responsible for larval development. Environ. Toxicol.

2055242244	We have previously shown that only a fraction of the newly synthesized human δ opioid receptors is able to leave the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and reach the cell surface (Petaja-Repo, U. E, Hogue, M., Laperriere, A., Walker, P., and Bouvier, M. (2000) J. Biol. Chem. 275, 13727–13736). In the present study, we investigated the fate of those receptors that are retained intracellularly. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that the disappearance of the receptor precursor form (M r 45,000) and of two smaller species (M r 42,000 and 39,000) is inhibited by the proteasome blocker, lactacystin. The treatment also promoted accumulation of the mature receptor form (M r55,000), indicating that the ER quality control actively routes a significant proportion of rescuable receptors for proteasome degradation. In addition, degradation intermediates that included full-length deglycosylated (M r 39,000) and ubiquitinated forms of the receptor were found to accumulate in the cytosol upon inhibition of proteasome function. Finally, coimmunoprecipitation experiments with the β-subunit of the Sec61 translocon complex revealed that the receptor precursor and its deglycosylated degradation intermediates interact with the translocon. Taken together, these results support a model in which misfolded or incompletely folded receptors are transported to the cytoplasmic side of the ER membrane via the Sec61 translocon, deglycosylated and conjugated with ubiquitin prior to degradation by the cytoplasmic 26 S proteasomes.

2055242267	Enzymatic casein hydrolysate (CH) combined with an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide or ammonium hydroxide and gelled in agar arrested more Anastrepha suspensa (Loew) females than gels of CH alone; males arrested in greater numbers on gels of CH combined with sodium hydroxide than on gels of CH alone. Significantly more males and females were captured in small glass traps baited with an aqueous solution of CH combined with sodium hydroxide than in traps baited with an aqueous solution of CH in laboratory tests. In preliminary field tests, capture of male and female flies in glass Mc Phail traps baited with an aqueous solution of CH was not significantly increased by the addition of sodium hydroxide.
2055242396	The different stages of meiotic prophase in germ cells of the rat ovary were studied cytologically at definite times when there was a dominant nuclear stage. Each stage was identified in 1 mu sections. The usual references for the definition of meiotic nuclear stages according to chromosomal structures wee used and have been described in more detail. It has also been shown that cytological observations such as the organization and distribution of cytoplasmic organelles (mitochondria, Golgi apparatus) equally contributes to the identification of the stages of meiotic prophase.

2055242411	Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was isolated from five species of the genus Salvelinus (alpinus, confluentus, fontinalis, malma, and namaycush) and from the closely related taxon, Hucho hucho. Restriction sites recognized by 14 endonucleases were mapped for each of the species and percent sequence divergence estimated between species pairs. A phylogeny of Savelinus based on restriction analysis of mtDNA, using Hucho as an outgroup, readily resolved the three subgenera: Baione, Cristivomer, and Salvelinus. Within Baione, no differences were detected between the mtDNA of brook (S. fontinalis fontinalis) and aurora (S. f. timagamiensis) trout. However, members of the subgenus Salvelinus were more variable such that two groups were resolved, one consisting of S. alpinus alpinus, S. a. oquassa, and S. malma, and the other of S. a. stagnalis and S. confluentus. A composite distance phenogram representing the phylogeny of the subfamily Salmoninae was constructed using the sequence divergence data obtained in the curre...
2055242462	Prenatal stress impairs activity of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress in adult offspring. So far, very few data are available on the effects of prenatal stress on circadian functioning of the HPA axis. Here, we studied the effects of prenatal stress on the circadian rhythm of corticosterone secretion in male and female adult rats. To evaluate the effects of prenatal stress on various regulatory components of corticosterone secretion, we also assessed the diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin, total and free corticosterone levels, and hippocampal corticosteroid receptors. Finally, in the search of possible maternal factors, we studied the effects of repeated restraint stress on the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant female rats. Results demonstrate that prenatal stress induced higher levels of total and free corticosterone secretion at the end of the light period in both males and females, and hypercorticism over the entire diurnal cycle in females. No diurnal fluctuation of adrenocorticotropin was observed in any group studied. The effects of prenatal stress on corticosterone secretion could be mediated, at least in part, by a reduction in corticosteroid receptors at specific times of day. Results also show that prepartal stress alters the pattern of corticosterone secretion in pregnant females. Those data indicate that prenatally stressed rats exhibit an altered temporal functioning of the HPA axis, which, taken together with their abnormal response to stress, reinforces the idea of a general homeostatic dysfunction in those animals.
2055242504	Alport syndrome (AS) can be caused by mutations in COL4A5, one of the six type IV collagen genes. For the purposes of confirming diagnoses, carrier screening and correlating genotype to phenotype, we have screened all 51 exons of this gene by SSCP analysis in 153 families with suspected AS. Mutations were identified in 77 families (of which 20 have previously been reported) and are reported with all available clinical information. All types of mutation were found (missense, nonsense, splicing, small and large deletions and insertions), with the commonest type being those affecting glycine residues in the collagen triple helix. Our 50% detection rate is similar to that of other groups and may imply the presence of mutations outside of the COL4A5 coding region or the existence of a second X-linked AS gene.
2055242506	Arnica montana L. (Asteraceae) is a valuable medicinal plant with anti-inflammatory and cicatrizing properties attributed to the sesquiterpene lactones, flavonoids and essential oil produced in the flower heads. In many European countries, the populations of A. montana are close to extinction in their natural habitats because of uncontrolled eradication and indiscriminate collection of the plants. Various approaches for in vitro propagation of the species and also, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in tissue and cell cultures are assessed in the current review. Special attention is paid to the biological activity and chemical composition of compounds produced by the species as well as the opportunities of in vitro methods to isolate high-productive clones. The influence of different factors on the micropropagation, callusogenesis, genetic transformation and identification of certain biologically active substances is discussed in detail. By the reference to the available issues we concluded that biotechnology applied to A. montana cultivation may improved the plant preservation and increased the production of sesquiterpene lactones and other secondary metabolites.
2055242542	BACKGROUND The circulation of human adenovirus type 21 (HAdV21) in the United States has been documented since the 1960s in association with outbreaks of febrile respiratory illness (FRI) in military boot camps and civilian cases of respiratory disease. METHODS To describe the molecular epidemiology of HAdV21 respiratory infections across the country, 150 clinical respiratory isolates obtained from continuous surveillance of military recruit FRI, and 23 respiratory isolates recovered from pediatric and adult civilian cases of acute respiratory infection were characterized to compile molecular typing data spanning 37 years (1978-2014). RESULTS Restriction enzyme analysis and genomic sequencing identified 2 clusters of closely related genomic variants readily distinguishable from the prototype and designated 21a-like and 21b-like. A-like variants predominated until 1999. A shift to b-like variants was noticeable by 2007 after a 7-year period (2000-2006) of cocirculation of the 2 genome types. US strains are phylogenetically more closely related to European and Asian strains isolated over the last 4 decades than to the Saudi Arabian prototype strain AV-1645 isolated in 1956. CONCLUSIONS Knowledge of circulating HAdV21 variants and their epidemic behavior will be of significant value to local and global FRI surveillance efforts.
2055242582	Compensatory growth of juvenile barramundi, Lates calcarifer (Bloch) was investigated at 28 °C for 8 weeks. Fish were divided into four feeding groups including one group with continuous feeding (C) and three other groups with food deprivation for 1 week (S1), 2 weeks (S2) and 3 weeks (S3), respectively. All starved fish resumed feeding in week 4. Changes in body weight, specific growth rate, feeding rate, food conversion efficiency and apparent digestion rate were examined weekly during the re-feeding period. Chemical compositions of fish were separately determined at the end of week 3 and week 8. Fish starved for 1 week reached the same weight as the control fish after re-feeding for 3 weeks, indicating that complete compensatory growth occurred. Although the specific growth rate in S2 or S3 fish was greater than that in the control fish after re-feeding, neither S2 nor S3 fish reached the same body weight of the control fish at the end. The feeding rates of S1, S2 and S3 fish were greater than those of control fish for a period of 2, 3 and 4 weeks, respectively. No significant differences in feeding rates were found among S1, S2 and S3 fish in the second week of re-feeding. Neither food conversion efficiency nor apparent digestion rate was significantly different among all treatments except that conversion efficiencies of S1 and the control fish were greater than those of S2 and S3 fish in week 7. At the end of food deprivation, the ratio of lipid to lean body mass (LBM) and the concentration of lipid, energy and moisture in S1, S2 and S3 fish were significantly less than those in the control fish, but the protein concentration in the control fish was greater than that in S2 or S3 fish. After re-feeding for 5 weeks, no difference in the concentrations of protein, ash, energy and moisture were detected among all treatments; however, the lipid concentration in S2 and S3 fish was less than that in the control fish. All fish deprived of food displayed a lower ratio of lipid to lean body weight than that in the control fish. Our results indicate that compensatory growth occurred in barramundi and the magnitude and duration of compensatory growth depended on the length of food deprivation.

2943210965	Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are covalently closed RNA circles without a 5' cap or 3' tail. Since the landmark discovery of ciRS-7/CDR1as functioning as a miR-7 sponge in 2013, circRNAs have become a hot topic in RNA research. CircRNAs have been found to play active roles in cancer, cardiovascular diseases, neurological disorders, and many other diseases. They can function as microRNA (miRNA) sponges, protein scaffolds, and even translation templates. However, as circRNA research expands, many divergent views have emerged. For example, are most circRNAs competent in serving as miRNA sponges? What kinds of circRNAs are most likely to sponge miRNAs? Apart from sponging miRNAs, what could the functions of most circRNAs be? What are the features of circRNAs that are translatable? Many researchers have claimed that circRNAs are abundant, stable, conserved, and specific molecules, which hold great potential in serving as biomarkers. However, circRNA abundance is variable and some circRNAs are abundant while others are not. In addition, their stability and conservation may vary under different circumstances. Furthermore, it is unclear whether circRNA biogenesis is more likely to be regulated by RNA binding proteins or transcription factors. All of these are open questions that remain to be answered by researchers in this field. Discussing and investigating these questions will advance the understanding of this class of novel molecules and may propel inspiring new ideas for future studies.

2398630426	Probioticotherapy and probioticoprophylaxis have been applied widely in Russia and the world of late. The article presents the main medical, strain-related, and biotechnological stages of their development in this country, in comparison with the results of the world practice. The authors substantiate appropriateness of creation of probiotics and which would contain either only growth medium components, able to activate normoflora (to increase colonization ability and stimulate production of biologically active substances) upon entering the organism, or only probiotic strain components and/or biologically active substances produced by biologically active strains in mono- or associative cultivation, or combination of the listed components.
2398630472	Fibre typing with antisera raised against specific myosin types from muscles of known physiological properties were used to characterise the fibre types within the oculorotatory muscles of pigeons. Fibres reacting strongly to antiserum anti-ALD (specific for tonic fibre myosin) were found lying along the global margin of the muscle and also in a layer lying immediately beneath a discrete band of fibres running along the orbital margin. These fibres resembled those of the skeletal muscle ALD in their type properties. Using another antiserum, anti-I, specific for slow twitch and to a lesser extent, slow tonic myosins, it was possible to identify another slow fibre type which formed the orbital layer and also lay scattered randomly through the body of the muscle. No equivalent to this type was found in the skeletal muscles ALD or iliofibularis. The remaining fibres which did not react with either anti-ALD or anti-I formed 58% of the fibre population and reacted with an antiserum specific for fast myosin. However, their response to alkali preincubation suggests that the fast fibres of eye muscles also contain a myosin which is different from those in skeletal muscle.
2398630548	Coptodon walteri Thys van den Audenaerde 1968, an endemic cichlid of Ivory Coast and Liberia, is assessed as Near Threatened due to fishing pressure, and loss of habitats and aquatic pollution as a result of extensive clandestine gold mining in the bed of the Cavally River. There is an immediate need for developing conservation and management plans for this species.
2398630567	A case of Edwards' syndrome after the replacement of frozen-thawed embryos is reported. The presence of cardiac abnormalities and limb deformities raised the suspicion of chromosomal abnormality. The diagnosis of trisomy 18 was made by cytogenetic analysis of fetal blood from the umbilical vein. The chromosomal nondisjunction might have been spontaneous or because of freezing and thawing. If it occurred as a result of freezing and thawing, it is more likely that this was at the first cleavage division rather than the second meiotic division because the embryos were frozen at the late pronuclear stage. Unfortunately, there were no karyotypic markers in the couple's chromosomes to time the nondisjunction. The wisdom of using donor oocytes in an ovum donation program from patients with long-standing infertility is questioned.
2398630597	Since the creation of the first transgenic rabbit thirty years ago, pronuclear microinjection remained the single applied method and resulted in numerous important rabbit models of human diseases, including cardiac deficiencies, albeit with low efficiency. For additive transgenesis a novel transposon mediated method, e.g., the Sleeping Beauty transgenesis, increased the efficiency, and its application to create cardiac disease models is expected in the near future. The targeted genome engineering nuclease family, e.g., the zink finger nuclease (ZFN), the transcription activator-like effector nuclease (TALEN) and the newest, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) with the CRISPR associated effector protein (CAS), revolutionized the non-mouse transgenesis. The latest gene-targeting technology, the CRISPR/CAS system, was proven to be efficient in rabbit to create multi-gene knockout models. In the future, the number of tailor-made rabbit models produced with one of the above mentioned methods is expected to exponentially increase and to provide adequate models of heart diseases.
2398631002	Colonial cell disaggregation and release of intracellular microcystin were evaluated following chlorine treatment of naturally occurring Microcystis. Microscopic observations of water samples collected from Lake Mead, Nevada, USA, confirmed the presence of colonial Microcystis with cells protected by an outer sheath up to 30 μm thick. During chlorination, two stages of cell decomposition were observed, stage 1: colonial cell disaggregation, and stage 2: unicellular degradation. Following a [Cl2]0:DOC0 ratio of 0.15 (t = 20 min, pH = 8.2-8.5) in unfiltered Lake Havasu samples, total particle count increased from (1.0 ± 0.11) × 10(5) to 4.2 × 10(5) particles/mL and fluorescent particle count increased from (1.2 ± 0.50) × 10(4) to 1.2 × 10(5) particles/mL, illustrating colonial cell disaggregation. Although total and fluorescent particles increased, the concentration of chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) decreased from 81 μg/L to 72 μg/L, and continued to decrease at higher [Cl2]0:DOC0 ratios. The preliminary second order rate constant for the reaction between Microcystis and chlorine in natural waters was estimated using either Chl-a (k = 15 M(-1) s(-1)) or fluorescence particle count (k = 38 M(-1) s(-1)) as an indicator of cell damage following colonial disaggregation (i.e., at [Cl2]0:DOC0 ratio ≥0.15). Complete release of intracellular microcystin-LR (MC-LR) was observed in both Lake Havasu and Lake Mead samples when applying a [Cl2]0:DOC0 ratio of 0.30 (t = 20 min), which was equivalent to a chlorine exposure of 8 min-mg/L for Lake Havasu samples. With chlorination, DOC increased by 3-18% indicating release of either colony-bound or cell-bound DOC. The results demonstrated the ability of chlorine to disaggregate/inactivate natural Microcystis colonies, and identified oxidation conditions resulting in complete release of intracellular MC-LR.
3149569520	This research was undertaken at the suggestion of Prof. Griinbaum, in order to discover whether any changes were produced in the chick embryo under the action of X-rays. Embryos of various ages were examined, both directly after exposure to doses of various amounts, and also at later periods. In none were any observations obtained of changes either in the embryo as a whole or in any particular organ, with the exception of one which affected all the tissues so exposed. It was found that X-rays had a general effect on the rate of division of the cells of the embryo, causing a diminution in the number of mitoses. This diminution was very evident in embryos exposed to long doses; for instance, chicks incubated for three days and then given a two hours' exposure, showed so marked a diminution that a considerable search was required to find any mitotic figures, while in an embryo of three days, exposed for four hours, no mitotic figures could be found. In order to discover whether this diminution was progressive from the beginning of the exposure, or whether initially an increase of mitotic activity occurred, small doses of 5 and 10 minutes were given to embryos of four days. These were used with their controls for the purpose of making quantitative counts. The fore-brain was selected as the most suitable tissue for counting owing to the regular arrangement of the cells. That portion only was counted which was of fairly uniform thickness, and, as far as possible, median sagittal sections only were used for counting, in order to count only cells cut in their principal plane. The sections were cut 5/u thick and cells were counted by their nuclei. The results of the counts are shown in Table I. The eggs were exposed at about 20 cm. distance from the anti-cathode.
2055242744	Since nitric oxide (NO) is implicated in the neuroendocrine control of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) secretion and sexual behavior which show diurnal variations, we monitored cGMP levels (an index of NO activity) in the extracellular compartment of the medial preoptic area (MPOA) using microdialysis. It was observed that MPOA cGMP levels rose significantly in the afternoon in both castrated and intact male rats, thereby suggesting the existence of a diurnal rhythm in MPOA cGMP/NO efflux which may participate in eliciting the well-known diurnal variations in LHRH neuronal activity and male sexual behavior.
2055242765	Fecal samples were collected from 64 Japanese rock ptarmigans (Lagopus mutus japonicus) at 13 locations in the alpine zone of Japan and examined for internal parasites. We found 2 morphologically different types of eimerian oocysts. Based on morphological characteristics, one was identified as Eimeria uekii, which had already been found from Japanese rock ptarmigans in 1981, and the other was likely a new type of Eimeria. The new type of eimerian oocysts required a longer sporulation time than E. uekii. The prevalence of both eimerian oocysts in Japanese rock ptarmigans was 62.5%, while that of E. uekii was 60.9% and the new type 29.7%. Mixed infection of both types was found in 28.1%.
2055242795	In this work we selected double-stranded DNA sequences capable of forming stable triplexes at 20 or 50 degrees C with corresponding 13mer purine oligonucleotides. This selection was obtained by a double aptamer approach where both the starting sequences of the oligonucleotides and the target DNA duplex were random. The results of selection were confirmed by a cold exchange method and the influence of the position of a 'mismatch' on the stability of the triplex was documented in several cases. The selected sequences obey two rules: (i) they have a high G content; (ii) for a given G content the stability of the resulting triplex is higher if the G residues lie in stretches. The computer simulation of the Mg2+, Na+and Cl-environment around three triplexes by a density scaled Monte Carlo method provides an interpretation of the experimental observations. The Mg2+cations are statistically close to the G N7 and relatively far from the A N7. The presence of an A repels the Mg2+from adjacent G residues. Therefore, the triplexes are stabilized when the Mg2+can form a continuous spine on G N7.
2055242816	Recent studies have explored certain changes with aging of neurons containing neuropeptides. The degree of loss of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-, neuropeptide Y (NPY)- and somatostatin-containing neurons in the aged CNS has not yet been established with certainty however, and available data is often contradictory. Changes with aging of VIP- and NPY-containing neurons were demonstrated by immunocytochemistry in this study. A major loss of VIP-immunoreactive (ir) neurons in aged rat brain was observed in the frontal cortex area 3, parietal cortex area 1, hindlimb area, temporal cortex area 1 and 2, monocular part of occipital cortex area 1, occipital cortex area 2, and retrosplenial cortex. VIP-ir cells in the frontal cortex areas 1 and 2, parietal cortex area 2, forelimb area, binocular part of the occipital cortex area 1, and the dentate gyrus were moderately decreased. The axis of VIP neurons in the aged group showed an irregular orientation tendency, especially in layers II and III. Major loss of NPY-ir neurons in aged rat brain were observed in the retrosplenial cortex, frontal cortex areas 1 and 2, parietal cortex areas 1 and 2, occipital cortex areas 1 and 2, the temporal cortex, hippocampus proper and cingulate cortex. Loss of NPY-ir neurons was observed mostly in layers V and VI. The number and length of dendritic branches also appeared to have decreased and shortened in the aged group. There were only slight decreases of somatostatin-ir cell numbers in the parietal and occipital cortex of the aged group. These results indicate the involvement of VIP and NPY-ir neurons in the aging process of cerebral cortex, and provide the morphological evidence for the decreased number of VIP and NPY neurons by immunocytochemistry in each area of cerebral cortex of aged rats.
2055242826	Pigs are proposed to be “mixing vessel” hosts that can produce genetically novel reassortant viruses with pandemic potential. The appearance of any novel influenza viruses among pigs should pose concerns for human health. Here, we report the complete genome sequence of a novel H4N1 influenza virus [A/Swine/HuBei/06/2009(H4N1)] isolated from a pig in Central China in 2009. The genomic sequence analysis indicates that this virus is a wholly avian-original influenza virus. Each gene may come from different avian influenza viruses outside mainland China, suggesting the role of migratory birds in the dispersal of influenza virus.
2055242873	The sC sequence from Aspergillus niger was cloned and developed into a homologous marker system for genetic transformation. The coding region of the sC gene amplified by PCR from the A. niger genome was provided with Aspergillus nidulans expression signals (gpdA promoter and trpC terminator). This chimeric construct was used to successfully transform a spontaneous sC- isolate of A. niger to prototrophy. The transformants analyzed by Southern analysis showed integration of multiple copies of the transforming DNA. They also exhibited much higher ATP sulfurylase activity than the wild-type A. niger strain reinforcing the molecular data. This demonstrates the usefulness of the sCniger construct, driven by PgpdA, as a marker for A. niger transformation.
2055242877	In Drosophila melanogaster and many other metazoans, the specification of germ cells requires cytoplasmic inheritance of maternally synthesized RNA and protein determinants, which are assembled in electron-dense cytoplasmic structures known as germ or polar granules, found at the posterior end of the oocytes. Recent studies have shown that the formation of germ granules is dependent on the interaction of proteins containing tudor domains with the piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA)-binding Piwi proteins, and such interactions are dependent on symmetrically dimethylated arginines (sDMAs) of Piwi proteins. Tudor–Piwi interactions are crucial and are conserved in the germ cells of sexually reproducing animals, including mammals. In the September 1, 2010, issue of Genes & Development, Liu and colleagues (pp. 1876–1881) use a combination of genetics, biochemistry, and crystallography to uncover the molecular and structural details of how Tudor recognizes and binds the sDMAs of the Piwi protein Aubergine.

2055243004	The pathogenesis of the diverse forms of prion disease was attributed solely to the accumulation of the misfolded PrP forms, and not to the potential loss of normal PrP(C) function during disease propagation. In this respect, it was also not established whether mutant PrPs linked to genetic prion diseases, as is the case for E200K PrP, preserve the function of PrP(C). We now show that fibroblasts generated from both PrP-ablated mice and TgMHu2ME199K, a transgenic mouse line mimicking E200KCJD, were significantly more sensitive to copper toxicity than wt fibroblasts. Long-term administration of copper significantly accelerated the onset and progression of spontaneous prion disease in TgMHu2ME199K mice and caused marked irritability and cerebellar associated tip-toe walking in PrP(0/0) mice, while wt mice were not affected. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a functional PrP(C) is required to protect cells from high levels of copper, and that its substitution for a nonfunctional mutant PrP may accelerate the onset of genetic prion disease during oxidative insults.
2055243017	Hepatomegaly is a sign of many liver disorders. To identify zebrafishmutants to serve as models for hepatic pathologies, we screened forhepatomegaly at day 5 of embryogenesis in 297 zebrafish lines bearingmutations in genes that are essential for embryonic development. Seven mutantswere identified, and three have phenotypes resembling different liverdiseases. Mutation of the class C vacuolar protein sorting gene vps18 results in hepatomegaly associated with large, vesicle-filled hepatocytes,which we attribute to the failure of endosomal-lysosomal trafficking.Additionally, these mutants develop defects in the bile canaliculi and havemarked biliary paucity, suggesting that vps18 also functions totraffic vesicles to the hepatocyte apical membrane and may play a role in thedevelopment of the intrahepatic biliary tree. Similar findings have beenreported for individuals with arthrogryposis-renal dysfunction-cholestasis(ARC) syndrome, which is due to mutation of another class C vps gene. A secondmutant, resulting from disruption of the tumor suppressor gene nf2 ,develops extrahepatic choledochal cysts in the common bile duct, suggestingthat this gene regulates division of biliary cells during development and that nf2 may play a role in the hyperplastic tendencies observed inbiliary cells in individuals with choledochal cysts. The third mutant is inthe novel gene foie gras , which develops large, lipid-filledhepatocytes, resembling those in individuals with fatty liver disease. Thesemutants illustrate the utility of zebrafish as a model for studying liverdevelopment and disease, and provide valuable tools for investigating themolecular pathogenesis of congenital biliary disorders and fatty liverdisease.
2055243021	The administration of recombinant vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) encoding a CTL epitope (pb9) from a malaria antigen induced activation and maturation of splenic dendritic cells (DCs) in vivo. In contrast, incubation of immature dendritic cells (iDCs) with the MVA, in vitro, resulted in down-regulation of MHC class I molecules and reduced their T-cell stimulatory ability. However, the ability of the infected DC to induce an antigen-specific CTL response, in vivo, remained intact. Furthermore, the administration of recombinant MVA-infected DC, but not pb9 peptide-pulsed DC, boosted and expanded the anti-pb9 CTL response that was primed by pb9 peptide-pulsed DC. These data indicate that despite the ability of poxviruses to impair DC maturation in vivo, the important ability of MVA to boost CD8 T-cell response in vivo is mediated at the level of the infected dendritic cells.
2055243119	Post-translational polypeptide tagging by conjugation with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like (Ub/Ubl) molecules is a potent way to alter protein functions and/or sort specific protein targets to the proteasome for degradation. Many poxviruses interfere with the host Ub/Ubl system by encoding viral proteins that can usurp this pathway. Some of these include viral proteins of the membrane-associated RING-CH (MARCH) domain, p28/Really Interesting New Gene (RING) finger, ankyrin-repeat/F-box and Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-a-Brac (BTB)/Kelch subgroups of the E3 Ub ligase superfamily. Here we describe and discuss the various strategies used by poxviruses to target and subvert the host cell Ub/Ubl systems.
2055243217	Tsetse flies (Diptera: Glossinidae:Glossina) mature their offspring in utero, giving birth to mature larvae that burrow into soil and pupariate. During the hot dry seasons, puparia of some species of tsetse are aggregated in areas of deep shade in dense thickets. We have confirmed the presence of a semiochemical from the prepupariation excretions of larvae ofGlossina morsitans morsitans Westwood and report a similar semiochemical inGlossina morsitans centralis Machado. These semiochemicals are attractive to gravid females and result in the aggregation of puparia. Behavioral studies withG. m. centralis showed that a higher percentage of females larviposited over moist sand conditioned by the anal exudate of larvae. Electroantennogram analyses of extracts of sand conditioned byG. m. centralis andG. m. morsitans confirmed the presence of olfactory receptors on the antennae for the semiochemicals. Both subspecies responded to extracts of the semiochemicals of the other, withG. m. morsitans more responsive to lower concentrations of extract ofG. m. centralis than the converse.
2398631042	OBJECTIVE This study was designed to examine the fluctuation tendency of the anterior teeth coloration during the period of growth puberty. METHODS One hundred children with average age of 13.3 years, and 100 adolescents with average age of 23.4 years were divided into two groups. The upper left incisors were selected for color matching using computerized spectrophotometery system (Shade-eye, Shofu). The measurements depicting color properties, including hue, value and chroma were quantitatively analyzed. Statistical evaluation was conducted for the comparison of the color measurements between the two groups. RESULTS The following trends were indicated during the period of growth puberty: (1)The hue of the coloration changed from redness into mixture of redness and grayness. (2)The magnitude of value of the coloration was in decline. (3)The intensity of chroma increased significantly. CONCLUSIONS The teeth coloration fluctuates within the period spanning the initial and final stages of growth puberty, characterized by a decrease in hue and value and an increase in chroma.
2398631074	Megalocytiviruses, such as infectious spleen and kidney necrosis virus (ISKNV), induce lethal systemic diseases in both ornamental and food fish species. In this study, we investigated an epizootic affecting Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus cultured in the US Midwest. Diseased fish displayed lethargy, gill pallor, and distension of the coelomic cavity due to ascites. Histopathological examination revealed a severe systemic abundance of intravascular megalocytes that were especially prominent in the gills, kidney, spleen, liver, and intestinal submucosa. Transmission electron microscopic examination revealed abundant intracytoplasmic polygonal virions consistent with iridovirus infection. Comparison of the full-length major capsid protein nucleotide sequences from a recent outbreak with a remarkably similar case that occurred at the same facility many years earlier revealed that both epizootics were caused by ISKNV. A comparison of this case with previous reports suggests that ISKNV may represent a greater threat to tilapia aquaculture than previously realized.
2398631150	Plant environmental responses involve dynamic changes in growth and signaling, yet little is understood as to how progress through these events is regulated. A pot experiment was conducted to assess whether exogenously applied brassinolide (BR) at various concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1 and 1.0 mg/L) could alleviate the adverse effects of salt stress (0 and 150 mmol/L NaCl) on Leymus chinensis. The results revealed that salt stress substantially disrupte d the growth, development and chlorophyll contents of L. chinensis which were improved by foliar application of BR. Moreover, as compared with the control, salt stress exacerbated the malondialdehyde content, and cell membrane permeability while decreased the leaf area, plant height, fresh and dry weight and root shoot ratio which ultimately hampered the seedlings growth. Applying BR elevated the contents of free proline, protein, and soluble sugars and thus, promoted the seedlings growth, being able to effectively alleviate the damage of NaCl stress. Although the activities of antioxidant enzymes, such as superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, catalase, ascorbate peroxidase and glutathione reductase were increased due to salt stress in plant , however, exogenously applied BR further elevated the level of the antioxidant system. In conclusion, improvement of growth, development, osmolytes, chlorophyll contents and antioxidant enzymes in L. chinensis due to foliar applied BR was found to be associated with BR-induced positive role in stress amelioration.
2398631251	The effectiveness of an aerosol producing system (In-Tox Products, Albuquerque, NM) commonly used for toxicological studies of chemicals and radioisotopes was evaluated for experimental tuberculosis infection of mice. Previously, experimental tuberculosis of rodents has been accomplished by aerosol infection devices which exposed the entire animal to the aerosol within a chamber. We utilized the In-Tox system to infect animals via the respiratory route with Mycobacterium bovis strain Bacille Calmette-Guerin (BCG) as a model for experimental pulmonary tuberculosis. The advantage ofthe device tested is that exposure to the infectious aerosol is limited to the nose ofthe animal. The present instrument was found to yield good implantation of mycobacteria into the lungs. The infectious load was reproducible and, with the addition of some filtration, the infectious agent was well contained within the device. Our results showed that this device is easy to operate, produces an effective experimental aerosol infection and is safe for the investigator.
2398631326	The loss of nucleotide pool precursors from the heart during ischemia and reperfusion may affect resynthesis of ATP and consequently mechanical recovery. Isolated working rat hearts were made globally ischemic for from 15 to 25 min, and the tissue content of adenine pool metabolites, creatine, creatine phosphate (CP), and inorganic phosphate (Pi), were measured after 20 min of reperfusion. In addition, the coronary effluent was assayed for nucleotides, nucleosides, and oxypurines. Hearts that recovered 75% or more of their preischemic hemodynamic function had significantly lower ATP and NAD but greater CP and Pi than controls. Complete failure of hearts was associated with severely depleted ATP but not CP. All hearts released 25% or more of their preischemic adenine pool during the 20-min reperfusion. This loss correlated more closely with a reduction in recovery from 100 to 75% than with complete failure. Thus extensive loss of adenine pool precursors is not critically related to the failure of heart muscle to recover function but may be an important limiting factor in determining the extent and time course of mechanical recovery.
2398631552	To evaluate the potential role of human herpesvirus type 6 (HHV-6) infection in patients after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) we sequentially analyzed buffy coat leukocytes, oral lavage fluid, and urine from 57 patients for the presence of HHV-6 DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) before and after 60 BMTs. Twenty-four patients undergoing autologous BMT and 36 with allogeneic BMT were studied. Thirty-six patients (60%) were PCR positive in one or more tests. The majority of PCR-positive patients had positive results only sporadically, in 1 (n = 23) or 2 weeks (n = 5). Six patients were positive in 3 to 5 weeks. In 2 patients, we found a high frequency of positive tests, in 7 of 7 and 10 of 10 weeks analyzed. Twenty-four patients (40%) remained PCR negative throughout the post-BMT period. There was a significant correlation between the results of HHV-6 PCR and the occurrence of acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD). In grade II-IV, 6 of 8 (75%) patients had 2 or more positive PCR tests, compared with 5 of 25 (20%) patients without or with grade I aGVHD (P = .01). There was no difference in the outcome of PCR tests with respect to the type of BMT or pre-BMT HHV-6 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay titers. Restriction enzyme analysis of PCR amplificates from 18 patients showed HHV-6 variant B in 16 (88.9%) and variant A in 2 cases (11.1%). We conclude that HHV-6 DNA can be detected in 60% of the patients after BMT. HHV-6 DNA can be detected more frequently in patients with moderate and severe aGVHD than in patients without aGVHD or with mild aGVHD.
2398631593	SUMMARY To evaluate fungi growth and aflatoxin B1 contamination in horse and dog feeds, total of 41 feed samples were examined with agar plate incubation and ELISA methods. Fungi growth of the horse feed was not exceeding maximum tolerable limits (0.97 x 104 CFU/g). Although dog foods should not contain any fungi contamination, slightly less than half of the tested dog foods had fungi growth. Both feeds had aflatoxin B1 content in allowable limits (10 µg/kg.), however, dog foods contain significantly higher aflatoxin B1 content than horse feeds do (P ≤ 0.05) (6.69 µg/kg and 1.98 µg/kg, respectively). Fungi growth and aflatoxin B1 content did not correlate in either group of feeds (r2 = 0.09 and r2 = 0.30, respectively). Surveilance of both fungi growth and aflatoxin contents of both types of feeds are necessary for the health of the animals.
2398631636	Saccharomyces cerevisiae KNU5377 has potential as an industrial strain that can ferment wasted paper for fuel ethanol at 40°C [15, 16]. To understand the characteristics of the strain, genome-wide expression was performed using DNA microarray technology. We compared the homology of the DNA microarray between genomic DNAs of S. cerevisiae KNU5377 and a control strain, S. cerevisiae S288C. Approximately 97% of the genes in S. cerevisiae KNU5377 were identified with those of the reference strain. YHR053c (CUP1), YLR155c (ASP3), and YDR038c (ENA5) showed lower homology than those of S. cerevisiae S288C. In particular, the differences in the regions of YHR053c and YLR155c were confirmed by Southern hybridization, but did not with that of the region of YDR038c. The expression level of mRNA in S. cerevisiae KNU5377 and S288C was also compared: the 550 ORFs of S. cerevisiae KNU5377 showed more than two-fold higher intensity than those of S. cerevisiae S288C. Among the 550 ORFs, 59 ORFs belonged to the groups of ribosomal proteins and mitochondrial ribosomal proteins, and 200 ORFs belonged to the group of cellular organization. DIPS and GAP1 were the most highly expressed genes. These results suggest that upregulated DIPS and GAP1 might take the place of ASPS and, additionally, the sensitivity against copper might be contributable to the lowest expression level of copper-binding metallothioneins encoded by CUPla (YHR053c) and CUPIb (YHR055c) in S. cerevisiae KNU5377.
3149569970	Thyroid cancer (TC) is the most common type of endocrine malignancy in humans, and its relative incidence has increased continuously in recent years. However, the primary molecular mechanisms of thyroid tumorigenesis and progression remain unclear. Papillary TC (PTC) is the most common subtype of TC. Recent studies have reported that one of the tumorigenesis and progression mechanisms is driven by genetic alterations that regulate the TC cell signaling pathway. In the present study, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed on 79 paired PTC and adjacent normal thyroid tissues to further study the molecular mechanisms of TC. Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR was used to detect the expression levels of LEM domain containing 1 (LEMD1) in 47 paired PTC and adjacent normal thyroid tissue samples. Initial analysis revealed that LEMD1 expression was significantly upregulated in TC tissues compared with that in normal tissues. The results of the thyroid RNA-seq datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas were consistent with the RNA-seq analysis results of the present study. High LEMD1 expression increased the risk of lymph node metastasis in patients with TC. The biological function of LEMD1 on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis was investigated in vitro via small interfering RNA and overexpression vector. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that high LEMD1 expression was associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway. Western blotting revealed that LEMD1 modulated the protein expression levels of E-cadherin, N-cadherin, vimentin, β-catenin and cleaved-caspase 3. In conclusion, the present results indicated that LEMD1 may drive TC cell tumorigenesis and progression by activating the Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathway and EMT.
3149570107	Resistance to acetolactate synthase (ALS) inhibiting herbicides has recently been reported in Glebionis coronaria from wheat fields in northern Tunisia, where the weed is widespread. However, potential resistance mechanisms conferring resistance in these populations are unknown. The aim of this research was to study target-site resistance (TSR) and non-target-site resistance (NTSR) mechanisms present in two putative resistant (R) populations. Dose-response experiments, ALS enzyme activity assays, ALS gene sequencing, absorption and translocation experiments with radiolabeled herbicides, and metabolism experiments were carried out for this purpose. Whole plant trials confirmed high resistance levels to tribenuron and cross-resistance to florasulam and imazamox. ALS enzyme activity further confirmed cross-resistance to these three herbicides and also to bispyribac, but not to flucarbazone. Sequence analysis revealed the presence of amino acid substitutions in positions 197, 376, and 574 of the target enzyme. Among the NTSR mechanisms investigated, absorption or translocation did not contribute to resistance, while evidences of the presence of enhanced metabolism were provided. A pretreatment with the cytochrome P450 monooxygenase (P450) inhibitor malathion partially synergized with imazamox in post-emergence but not with tribenuron in dose-response experiments. Additionally, an imazamox hydroxyl metabolite was detected in both R populations in metabolism experiments, which disappeared with the pretreatment with malathion. This study confirms the evolution of cross-resistance to ALS inhibiting herbicides in G. coronaria from Tunisia through TSR and NTSR mechanisms. The presence of enhanced metabolism involving P450 is threatening the chemical management of this weed in Tunisian wheat fields, since it might confer cross-resistance to other sites of action.

3149570164	We assessed the diversity of fungal DNA present in sediments of three lakes on Vega Island, north-east Antarctic Peninsula using metabarcoding through high-throughput sequencing (HTS). A total of 640,902 fungal DNA reads were detected, which were assigned to 224 taxa of the phyla Ascomycota, Rozellomycota, Basidiomycota, Chytridiomycota and Mortierellomycota, in rank order of abundance. The most abundant genera were Pseudogymnoascus, Penicillium and Mortierella. However, a majority (423,508, 66%) of the reads, representing by 43 ASVs, could only be assigned at higher taxonomic levels and may represent taxa not currently included in the sequence databases used or be new or previously unreported taxa present in Antarctic lakes. The three lakes were characterized by high sequence diversity, richness, and moderate dominance indices. The ASVs were dominated by psychrotolerant and cosmopolitan cold-adapted Ascomycota, Basidiomycota and Mortierellomycota commonly reported in Antarctic environments. However, other taxa detected included unidentified members of Rozellomycota and Chytridiomycota species not previously reported in Antarctic lakes. The assigned diversity was composed mainly of taxa recognized as decomposers and pathogens of plants and invertebrates.
2943212148	Members of the Arabidopsis thaliana TCP transcription factor (TF) family affect plant growth and development. We systematically quantified the effect of mutagenizing single or multiple TCP TFs and how altered vegetative growth or branching influences final seed yield. We monitored rosette growth over time and branching patterns and seed yield characteristics at the end of the lifecycle. Subsequently, an approach was developed to disentangle vegetative growth and to determine possible effects on seed yield. Analysis of growth parameters showed all investigated tcp mutants to be affected in certain growth aspects compared with wild-type plants, highlighting the importance of TCP TFs in plant development. Furthermore, we found evidence that all class II TCPs are involved in axillary branch outgrowth, either as inhibitors (BRANCHED-like genes) or enhancers (JAW- and TCP5-like genes). Comprehensive phenotyping of plants mutant for single or multiple TCP TFs reveals that the proposed opposite functions of class I and class II TCPs in plant growth needs revision and shows complex interactions between closely related TCP genes instead of full genetic redundancy. In various instances, the alterations in vegetative growth or in branching patterns result into negative trade-off effects on seed yield that were missed in previous studies, showing the importance of comprehensive and quantitative phenotyping.
2055243234	The success of comparative analysis in resolving RNA secondary structure and numerous tertiary interactions relies on the presence of base covariations. Although the majority of base covariations in aligned sequences is associated to Watson-Crick base pairs, many involve non-canonical or restricted base pair exchanges (e.g. only G:C/A:U), reflecting more specific structural constraints. We have developed a computer program that determines potential base pairing conformations for a given set of paired nucleotides in a sequence alignment. This program (ISOPAIR) assumes that the base pair conformation is maintained through sequence variation without significantly affecting the path of the sugar-phosphate backbone. ISOPAIR identifies such 'isomorphic' structures for any set of input base pair or base triple sequences. The program was applied to base pairs and triples with known structures and sequence exchanges. In several instances, isomorphic structures were correctly identified with ISOPAIR. Thus, ISOPAIR is useful when assessing non-canonical base pair conformations in comparative analysis. ISOPAIR applications are limited to those cases where unusual base pair exchanges indeed reflect a non-canonical conformation.
2055243254	A linear relationship of positive slope was found between the ratios of organic nitrogen: chlorophyll a and total carotenoids: chlorophyll a in cultures of five freshwater phytoplankters as they recovered from N-deficiency. This differed markedly from information in the literature for a marine diatom under similar conditions.  This relationship in cultures of a freshwater diatom was not significantly different from one calculated from data in the literature for a N-deficient natural population of marine diatoms. Therefore it is suggested that, under conditions of limiting nitrogen, the natural ratio of plant pigments can he used in conjunction with the nitrogen: pigment relationship to estimate the quantity of nitrogen in natural phytoplankton as distinct from other sources of particulate nitrogen in surface waters.
2055243295	Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) is the hallmark of exudative age-related macular degeneration and a leading cause of visual loss after age 55. The pathogenesis of new choroidal vessel formation is poorly understood. Although inflammation has been implicated in the development of CNV, the role of complement in CNV has not been experimentally explored. A reliable way to produce CNV in animals is to rupture Bruch’s membrane with laser photocoagulation. A murine model of laser-induced CNV in C57BL/6 mice revealed the deposition of C3 and membrane attack complex (MAC) in the neovascular complex. CNV was inhibited by complement depletion using cobra venom factor and did not develop in C3(−/−) mice. Anti-murine C6 Abs in C57BL/6 mice inhibited MAC formation and also resulted in the inhibition of CNV. Vascular endothelial growth factor, TGF-beta2, and beta-fibroblast growth factor were elevated in C57BL/6 mice after laser-induced CNV; complement depletion resulted in a marked reduction in the level of these angiogenic factors. Thus, activation of complement, specifically the formation of MAC, is essential for the development of laser-induced choroidal angiogenesis in mice. —Hans E. Grossniklaus
2055243297	The University of Illinois malaria vaccine programme uses culture-derived soluble exoantigens of Plasmodium falciparum and the squirrel monkey as an experimental model. Exoantigens are soluble polypeptides naturally released into the blood plasma of animals infected with Babesia or Plasmodium species, or into the supernatant medium of in vitro cultures of these organisms. Immunization with soluble B. bovis and B. bigemina exoantigens prepared from culture supernatant fluids protected cattle against homologous and heterologous challenge. Similarly, vaccination of squirrel monkeys with supernatant fluids from P. falciparum cultures containing exoantigen induced protective immunity against acute clinical malaria. Susceptible monkeys have been vaccinated with an aluminium hydroxide-fortified antigenic fraction partially purified from supernatants of P. falciparum strains Indochina I and Geneve/SGE-1; this conferred significant clinical protection against needle challenge with the homologous Indochina I strain, and a moderate degree of immunity to the heterologous strain. Following sequential purification by high performance liquid chromatography, the N-terminal amino acid sequences of P. falciparum 100 kDa, 83 kDa and 70 kDa exoantigens were determined. A 29 amino acid peptide constructed from the N-terminal sequence of the P. falciparum (Geneve strain) 83 kDa exoantigen has been synthesized. When coupled to a carrier protein, the peptide was immunogenic in rabbits, mice and squirrel monkeys, inducing antibodies which were trophozoite-specific, reactive to native parasite proteins in a two-site enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and in Western blots, and which inhibited P. falciparum growth in vitro. Using this synthetic peptide, EIAs are being developed for the detection of antibodies to P. falciparum blood-phase parasites in individuals living in malaria-endemic areas of Africa, Asia and South America.

2055243407	Cell adhesion molecules, such as N-cadherin (cdh2), are essential for normal neuronal development, and as such have been implicated in an array of processes including neuronal differentiation and migration, and axon growth and fasciculation. cdh2 is expressed in neurons of the peripheral nervous system during development, but its role in these cells during this time is poorly understood. Using the transgenic zebrafish line, tg(p2xr3.2:eGFP(sl1)), we have examined the involvement of cdh2 in the formation of sensory circuits by the peripheral nervous system. The tg(p2xr3.2:eGFP(sl1)) fish allows visualization of neurons comprising the trigeminal, facial, glossopharyngeal and vagal ganglia and their axons throughout development. Reduction of cdh2 in this line was achieved by either crosses to the cdh2-mutant strain, glass onion (glo) or injection of a cdh2 morpholino (MO) into single-cell embryos. Here we show that cdh2 function is required to alter the directional vectors of growing axons upon reaching intermediate targets. The central axons enter the hindbrain appropriately but fail to turn caudally towards their final targets. Similarly, the peripheral axons extend ventrally, but fail to turn and project along a rostral/caudal axis. Furthermore, by expressing dominant negative cdh2 constructs selectively within cranial sensory ganglia (CSG) neurons, we found that cdh2 function is necessary within the axons to elicit these stereotypic turns, thus demonstrating that cdh2 acts cell autonomously. Together, our in vivo data reveal a novel role for cdh2 in the establishment of circuits by peripheral sensory neurons.
2055243467	Background: As described in Unani and Ayurveda, herbal medicines are sources of treating the morbid conditions. The drugs that obtained from trees, shrubs or herbs contribute about 25 percent of the total prescription drugs. Antimicrobial potential of ten medicinal plants i.e. Picrorhiza kurroa, Datura metel, Acacia catechu, Cissus quadrangularis, Cassia tora, Berberis aristata, Pongamia pinnata, Emblica officinalis, Saraca asoca and Tinospora cordifolia was evaluated against three fungal strains of. Aspergillus i.e. Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus and Aspergillus niger. Methods: Crude extracts were prepared using Soxhlet extraction and aqueous extraction methods. Total sixty extracts of ten different plants were screamed for antifungal activity using microbroth dilution assay, disc diffusion assay and spore germinatery inhibitory assay. Results & discussion: Percent yields of petroleum ether and chloroform extracts of plant leaves was found to be in the range of 0.80e2.98%. Percent yields of acetone, methanol and water extract were found to ranging from 2.87 to 5.77%. Minimum inhibitory concentration of extracts was determined by microtiter dilution assay. Water extract of S. asoca showed maximum activity against A. fumigatus (0.65 mg/ml). The extracts with MIC ranging from 2.5 mg/ml to 0.65 mg/ml were further evaluated for their potential using disc diffusion assay. It was observed that only eight out of sixty plants extracts were found to be endowed with antifungal activity at a preset concentration of 25 mg/disc by disc diffusion assay. Maximum zone of inhibition at this concentration was 13.2 � 0.5 mm against A. fumigatus by water extract of S. asoca. Conclusion: It was observed that leave water extracts of S. asoca could be potential reservoir of bioactive compounds. Further proteomics study of the test microbes could reconnoiter potential anti-bacterial targets.
2055243495	An interactome is defined as a network of protein-protein interactions built from experimentally verified interactions. Basic science as well as application-based research of potential new drugs can be promoted by including proteins that are only predicted into interactomes. The disadvantage of doing so is the risk of devaluing the definition of interactomes. By adding proteins that have only been predicted, an interactome can no longer be classified as experimentally verified and the integrity of the interactome will be endured. Therefore, we propose the term 'hypothome' (collection of hypothetical interactions of predicted proteins). The purpose of such a term is to provide a denotation to the interactome concept allowing the interaction of predicted proteins without devaluing the integrity of the interactome. We define a rule-set for a hypothome and have integrated the predicted protein interaction partners to the hypothetical protein. EAW74251 is an example for the usage of a hypothome.
2055243524	Sapovirus (SaV) belongs to the family Caliciviridae and is a causative agent of gastroenteritis in children and adults ([6][1], [2][2]).

2055243538	This chapter reviews the reproductive actions of phytoestrogens, comparing mechanisms of action, dose-response relationships, and human exposures. Although a wide range of biochemical actions have been reported for phytoestrogens, in vitro tests suggest that phytoestrogens may be more likely to act through receptor-mediated mechanisms than through enzyme inhibition. Epithelial cell proliferation in the reproductive tract and anestrus are well-documented actions of isoflavonoids in experimental studies of animals. However, thus far, soy-based diets have generally failed to produce epithelial proliferation in ovariectomized rats and monkeys or menopausal women, and clinical studies have produced mixed evidence for effects of soy isoflavones on the human menstrual cycle or post-menopausal gonadotropin secretion. There has been considerable interest in the use of phytoestrogens as oestrogen replacement therapy in menopausal women. Reported results of initial clinical trials have been mixed, and it is unclear whether isoflavones in presently advised doses can substantially reduce menopausal symptoms. Some recent trials with oral isoflavone supplements report reductions in hot flushes, vaginal dryness, and breast pain. There is also limited clinical evidence for protective actions of isoflavones in mammary cancer. Like other oestrogenic substances, the isoflavonoids are effective differentiating agents in rodent models of development. The consequences of these actions for humans is of interest due to the high concentrations of isoflavonoids in some infant formulae. Thus, it is likely that some humans may experience greater exposure to phytoestrogens in infancy than in any other lifestage. At the time of writing, no ill effects of such exposure have been reported.
2055243543	The genus Subergorgia (coelenterata, Gorgonacea, Subergorgiidae) is distributed in the Indo-pacific region. Previous investigations on the various species of the genus have revealed the presence of a number of new compounds including alkaloids, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and steroids. Certain biological activities particularly cytotoxic activity have been observed for the isolated constituents and compositions derived from the coral. This review covers the secondary metabolites reported from the genus Subergorgia and their biological properties.
2055243546	Cystine depleted cystinotic fibroblasts incubated in cystine-free medium accumulate lysosomal-free cystine from the degradation of cystine-containing intracellular and extracellular proteins. In this report we have used this characteristic of these cells to study lysosomal proteolysis. We find that inhibitors of protein synthesis (cycloheximide, emetine, and puromycin) inhibit cystine accumulation from endogenous proteins and therefore act to inhibit lysosomal proteolysis of these proteins. However, cycloheximide does not inhibit cystine accumulation derived from the degradation of the extracellular disulfide-rich proteins, albumin and RNase, but lysosomal cystine accumulation derived from insulin is inhibited by cycloheximide. We conclude that a rapidly turning over protein may be required for the lysosomal degradation of intracellular and some extracellular proteins.
2055243559	The study of the relationship between biological clocks and learning and memory in insects goes back to work on Zeitgedachtnis (time memory) in bees originating in the early 1900s when it was shown that bees were able to remember the time of day a specific food source was available. More recent work has expanded on the role of circadian phase in memory acquisition, consolidation, and recall in additional insect species. The results show that the circadian system can modulate the ability of individuals to acquire memories or the ability to retrieve memories; however, questions remain both about the mechanisms by which the circadian system regulates these processes and about the functional/adaptive significance of this novel feature of insect circadian organization.
2055243582	Little is known of the serotoninergic innervation of the thalamus in primates; therefore, we undertook a detailed study of the distribution of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)-immunoreactive neuronal profiles in the thalamus of the squirrel monkey (Saimiri sciureus) with a specific antibody directly raised against 5-HT. All thalamic nuclei in the squirrel monkey displayed 5-HT-immunoreactive fibers, but none contained immunopositive cell bodies. The 5-HT innervation of the thalamus derived from extrinsic fibers arising mostly from the midbrain raphe nuclei and forming the transtegmental system. Most of the fibers destined to the thalamus collected into a major bundle that swept dorsoventrally within the midbrain tegmentum and coursed beneath the thalamus along its entire caudorostral extent. Several fiber fascicles broke off from this main bundle at different levels and ascended dorsally to innervate the various thalamic nuclei. Overall, the 5-HT innervation of the thalamus in the squirrel monkey was more massive than would have been expected from earlier studies in nonprimate species. Marked differences in the regional density of innervation were noted both between the various nuclei and within single nuclei. The most densely innervated nuclei were those delineating the principal subdivisions of the thalamic mass, that is, the midline, rostral intralaminar, limitans, and reticular nuclei, where very dense fields of isolated axonal varicosities occurred. In contrast to the rostral intralaminar nuclei, which were rather uniformly innervated, the centre median/parafascicular complex contained immunoreactive fibers and isolated varicosities distributed according to a mediolateral gradient. The habenula and the ventral anterior nucleus were among the most weakly innervated nuclei. In the latter nucleus, as well as in more densely innervated nuclei, thin varicose fibers formed numerous pericellular contacts on cell bodies and proximal dendrites of thalamic neurons. The 5-HT innervation of the lateral nuclear group as well as that of the medial and lateral geniculate nuclei ranged from very weak to dense. The mediodorsal nucleus displayed a highly heterogeneous 5-HT innervation that varied from weak in its central portion to moderate or dense in its medial and lateral borders. A moderate 5-HT innervation was observed in the anterior nuclear group. The surprisingly dense and heterogeneous 5-HT innervation of the thalamus noted in the present study suggests that serotonin may be involved in several specific functions of the thalamus in primates.
2055243588	A 72-year-old woman had a 7-year history of a scaly red area on the right breast which had enlarged asymptomatically. A biopsy of the nipple was taken, and, following the finding of Paget's disease, a modified radical mastectomy was carried out. On histological examination of the entire breast specimen by serial sections, no evidence of an intraductal adenocarcinoma was found. Fractionation of Paget cells was performed from the epidermis. Stripped skin was treated with EDTA and trypsin, and epidermal cell suspensions were obtained. They were layered onto discontinuous Percoll gradients and centrifuged. Paget cells fell into three fractions with densities of 1.041, 1.058, and 1.078. Electronmicroscopically, the purity of fractionated cells obtained by this method ranged from 55 to 74% with viabilities of from 70 to 90%. Microscopic analysis of the DNA content in these cells was performed. The DNA histogram was close to the normal ploidy. This may explain why the mammary Paget's disease lesions in this case enlarged rather slowly.
2055243630	Leptospire lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulated the adherence of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) to human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). Enhanced PMN adherence in response to leptospire LPS can be mediated by platelet-activator-factor (PAF), because a PAF antagonist reduced adherence. Leptospire LPS also induced the adherence platelets or U937. The second experiment involved leptospire LPS elicited platelet aggregation in a PMN-platelet mixture, because leptospire LPS stimulated human PMN but not the human platelets. The platelet response was observed only in the mixture system and was inhibited by a PAF antagonist. PAF could be an important pathogenic factor in human leptospirosis.
2055243636	Helicobacter pylori is a pathogenic bacterium that colonizes more than 50% of the world’s population, which leads to a tremendous medical burden. H. pylori infection is associated with such varied diseases as gastritis, peptic ulcers, and two forms of gastric cancer: gastric adenocarcinoma and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. This association represents a novel paradigm for cancer development; H. pylori is currently the only bacterium to be recognized as a carcinogen. Therefore, a significant amount of research has been conducted to identify the bacterial factors and the deregulated host cell pathways that are responsible for the progression to more severe disease states. Two of the virulence factors that have been implicated in this process are CagA and VacA, which are cytotoxins that are injected and secreted by H. pylori, respectively. Both of these virulence factors are polymorphic and affect a multitude of host cellular pathways. These combined facts could easily contribute to differences in disease severity across the population as various CagA and VacA alleles differentially target some pathways. Herein we highlight the diverse types of cellular pathways and processes targeted by these important toxins.
2055243714	Hepatitis delta virus (HDV) has an envelope composed of large-, middle-, and small-form hepatitis B surface antigens (HBsAgs) provided by the helper hepatitis B virus (HBV). In order to examine the roles of individual HBsAgs in HDV assembly, we constructed plasmids containing each specific HBsAg gene and then cotransfected each plasmid with HDV cDNA into a permissive human hepatoma cell line (HuH-7) to examine the effects on HDV production. Results indicated that the plasmids containing only the HBsAg genes were able to complement HDV cDNA as efficiently as the plasmid containing the complete HBV genome in generating HDV-like particles. Moreover, the small-form HBsAg alone was sufficient for HDV packaging. The particles produced from the cotransfection experiments have density and protein composition characteristics similar to those of naturally occurring HDV. With the electron microscope, they were identified as 36- to 38-nm-diameter particles. It was concluded that only the HBsAgs were able to help in the assembly of HDV-like particles.
2398631775	A new cultivar of Phygelius named ‘CROCORPRI’ that is characterized by dense compact habit, purple stems, dark-green foliage, and coral flowers that bloom late summer and fall.

2398632109	"Recent studies conducted in our laboratory demonstrate that Aspergillus parasiticus synthesizes and stores aflatoxin in transport vesicles and endosomes. Proteomics data suggest that enzymes involved in the synthesis of other secondary metabolites as well as enzymes involved in response to heat, osmotic, and oxidative stress also localize to these subcellular organelles. In order to better understand how cells integrate the regulation and function of secondary metabolite biosynthesis and stress response, it is important to understand the composition and function of the membrane-bound organelles that house this biosynthetic machinery. Isolation of vesicles, endosomes, and vacuoles (V fraction) is, therefore, an essential method to study secondary metabolism in A. parasiticus at the cellular level. Here, we describe a ""one-step density gradient"" method for purification of a highly heterogeneous cell fraction consisting of transport vesicles, endosomes, and vacuoles from protoplasts prepared from A. parasiticus cells harvested during aflatoxin synthesis."
2398632181	MEIS2 aberrations are considered to be the cause of intellectual disability, cleft palate and cardiac septal defect, as MEIS2 copy number variation is often observed with these phenotypes. To our knowledge, only one nucleotide-level change-specifically, an in-frame MEIS2 deletion-has so far been reported. Here, we report a female patient with a de novo nonsense mutation (c.611C>G, p.Ser204*) in MEIS2. She showed severe intellectual disability, moderate motor/verbal developmental delay, cleft palate, cardiac septal defect, hypermetropia, severe feeding difficulties with gastro-esophageal reflux and constipation. By reviewing this patient and previous patients with MEIS2 point mutations, we found that feeding difficulty with gastro-esophageal reflux appears to be one of the core clinical features of MEIS2 haploinsufficiency, in addition to intellectual disability, cleft palate and cardiac septal defect.
2398632196	SUMMARY Ten pregnant heifers were inoculated intramuscularly at 50–51 days gestation with an emulsion of tissues from lambs affected with ovine Border Disease (BD); the same inoculum was used to inject 24 pregnant ewes at 25–40 days gestation. Six of the cows aborted between 117 and 264 days gestation and three more showed evidence of foetal death between 117 and 176 days; only one produced a live healthy calf at term. All the bovine foetuses showed severe growth retardation, and in three there was gross bilaterally symmetrical cavitation of the cerebrum. All the cows developed antibodies to bovine virus diarrhoea virus. It is concluded that the BD agent could be a potentially serious cause of reproductive failure in cattle which merits further investigation.
3149570469	The results indicated that before male heading 95% of eggs oviposited during the second generation was laid on the upper side of the maize leaf and 6.5% on the stem, while during the third generation of the same growing stage, 89.5% on the leaf upper side and 10.5% on the stem. But during the period of male heading, 59.1% of the eggs was laid on male ear, 26.1% on fresh pistils, 11.1% on the upper side of the leaf, and 2.9% on the stem. However, about 97.5% of eggs was laid on pistils of the maize, and 2.0% and 0.5% was on the upper side of leaf and stem respectively after heading. When the eggs of the third generation were being laid, the sum of the eggs on the maize while heading is 2 times more than before heading. In the tree growth stages, the number of the eggs after heading is the least.
3149570493	Awnness is a key trait in rice domestication, yet no studies have been conducted on fine mapping or association mapping of the rice awn gene. In this study, we investigated the awnness and genotype of a core collection of 303 cultivated rice varieties and a BC5F2 segregating population of 200 individuals. Combining association and linkage analyses, we mapped the awnness related genes to chromosome 4. Primary association analysis using 24 SSR markers revealed five loci significantly associated with awnness on chromosome 4. The associated markers cover previously identified regions. Fine association mapping was conducted using another 29 markers within a 4-Mb region, covering the associated marker in34, which is close to the awn gene Awn4.1. Seven associated markers were revealed, distributed over an 870-kb region. Combining the fine association mapping and linkage analysis of awnness in the 200 BC5F2 segregating population, we finally identified a 330-kb region as the candidate region for Awn4.1. The results indicate that combining association mapping and linkage mapping provides an efficient and precise approach to both genome-wide mapping and fine mapping of rice genes.

2943212357	Ehrlichia canis and Anaplasma platys are intracellular tick-transmitted bacteria that infect dogs; there is evidence for limited zoonotic potential as well. The prevalence of E. canis in Colombia has been evaluated in different regions; however little is known about the prevalence or distribution of A. platys. Neither pathogen has been studied in the Magdalena region, thus the purpose of our study was to assess the prevalence of these pathogens in dogs attending veterinary clinics from the cities of Santa Marta and Cienaga, and to assess possible associated risk factors for infection. A. platys and E. canis infections in blood were evaluated by Taqman PCR assays. E. canis was detected in 26/170 (15.3%, 95% CI 10.4%-21.8%) and A. platys in 34/168 (20.2%, 95% CI 14.6%-27.3%) of all dogs tested. Eleven dogs (6.5%, 95% CI 3.4-11.7%) were coinfected with both pathogens. Sequencing results showed low diversity within E. canis and within A. platys strains, however a strain of E. canis detected in our study area is genetically distinct from strains reported in another city of Colombia. Our results suggest that for A. platys, Santa Marta dogs were at greater risk than Cienaga dogs, and that purebred dogs were at slightly lower risk in both areas. The confirmation of these pathogens in northern Colombia should cause concern for the possible co-transmission of these agents to humans or animals in the region.

2055243775	Several genes have been located in the chromosomal region 17q21 genetically associated with progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP). Corticotropin releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1) is a gene included in this region. In order to investigate the possible involvement of CRHR1 in PSP pathogenesis, we measured the globus pallidus mRNA expression of this gene using real-time PCR in 12 PSP comparing with several control groups composed by 10 Alzheimer's disease, 5 cerebrovascular disease and 6 healthy controls subjects. We furthermore sequenced directly the entire coding region of CRHR1 of two histopathologically confirmed PSP patients. Expression pattern of CRHR1 in globus pallidus was similar in all groups. We did not find any coding non-synonymous mutation in the patients analysed. Our results do not support an involvement of CRHR1 gene in PSP pathogenesis.
2055243783	The objectives of this work are the optimization of the codons of xylA gene from Thermus thermophilus to enhance the production of recombinant glucose isomerase (rGI) in P. pastoris and to investigate the effects of feeding strategies on rGI production. Codons of xylA gene from T. thermophilus were optimized, ca. 30 % of the codons were replaced with those with higher frequencies according to the codon usage bias of P. pastoris, codon optimization resulted in a 2.4-fold higher rGI activity. To fine-tune bioreactor performance, fed-batch bioreactor feeding strategies were designed as continuous exponential methanol feeding with pre-calculated feeding rate based on the pre-determined specific growth rate, and fed-batch methanol-stat feeding. Six feeding strategies were designed, as follows: (S1) continuous exponential methanol- and pulse- sorbitol feeding; (S2) continuous exponential methanol- and peptone- feeding; (S3) continuous exponential methanol- and pulse- mannitol feeding; (S4) continuous exponential methanol- and peptone- feeding and pulse-mannitol feeding; (S5) methanol-stat feeding by keeping methanol concentration at 5 g L−1; and, (S6) methanol-stat feeding by keeping methanol concentration at 5 g L−1 and pulse-mannitol feeding. The highest cell and rGI activity was attained as 117 g L−1 at t = 66 h and 32530 U L−1 at t = 53 h, in strategy-S5. The use of the co-substrate mannitol does not increase the rGI activity in methanol-stat feeding, where 4.1-fold lower rGI activity was obtained in strategy-S6. The overall cell yield on total substrate was determined at t = 53 h as 0.21 g g−1 in S5 strategy.
2055243862	A sero-epidemiological study of cats and dogs in the Launceston area of Tasmania, Australia was undertaken to determine the prevalence of antibodies to spotted fever group (SFG) rickettsiae. Results showed that 59% of cats and 57% of dogs were positive for antibodies, but there was no correlation between the animal's health and seropositivity at the time of testing, suggesting that rickettsial exposure is unrelated to ill-health in these two species of domestic animals.
2055243882	The objective of this work was to evaluate the antihypertensive and antioxidant effect of seaweeds (Ulva linza and Lessonia trabeculata) in rats which were fed a hypercaloric diet. Seaweed at 400 mg kg−1 of body weight was administered for 8 weeks to Wistar rats that were fed with a standard diet or a hypercaloric diet. Intra-abdominal fat, insulin resistance, and lipid profile of the rats were determined. Liver was isolated to determine antioxidant enzymes [superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase (GPx)] activity and gene expression. The administration of seaweed to the rats reduced the levels of intra-abdominal fat, arterial blood pressure, insulin resistance, and cholesterol and triglyceride serum levels. U. linza reduced the GPx activity in control animals but increased it in animals with MS, which could be reduced by using L. trabeculata. Both seaweeds diminished the SOD and GPx expression and increased CAT in control group. Both seaweeds reduced the CAT expression in animals with metabolic syndrome. Combined effects of the different compounds found in the seaweeds explain the regulating effect over different antioxidant enzymes and metabolic pathways that protect the animals fed a hypercaloric diet against the development of hypertension, hyperglycemia, and obesity.
2055243935	Nearest neighbour relationships within the LHC2-PS2 complex were investigated by using the reversible crosslinking agent dithiobis(succinimidyl propionate) (DSP). This was accomplished by treating PS2-enriched membranes, prepared from chloroplasts of Pisum sativum, with the crosslinker followed by diagonal electrophoresis of the solubilised polypeptides. Analysis of the off-diagonal spot patterns produced by crosslinker cleavage and second dimension electrophoresis was made on the basis of: staining with Coomassie blue or silver, labelling with [35S]-methionine, and sensitivity to 1 M NaCl washing. It was concluded that LHC2 polypeptides crosslinked with several components of the PS2 complex and that the extrinsic polypeptides associated with water oxidation, having approximate molecular weights of 16 and 23 kDa, crosslink to form homodimers. The latter finding suggests that there may be more than one copy of each of these polypeptides per PS2 complex.
2055243948	Abstract Few studies have investigated microtubules from plants that host pathogenic fungi. Considerable efforts are underway to find an antimitotic agent against plant pathogens like Phytophthora infestans . However, screening the effects of antifungal agents on plant tubulin in vivo or using purified native microtubule in vitro is a time consuming process. A recombinant, correctly folded, microtubule-like structure forming tubulin could accelerate research in this area. In this study, we cloned full length cDNAs isolated from potato leaves using reverse-transcribed polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Solanum tuberosum (Stub) α-tubulin and β-tubulin were predicted to encode 449 and 451 amino acid long proteins with molecular masses of 57 kDa and 60 kDa, respectively. Average yields of α- and β-tubulin were 2.0–3.5 mg l −1 and 1.3–3.0 mg l −1 of culture, respectively. The amino acids, His6, Glu198, and Phe170 involved in benomyl sensitivity were conserved in Stub tubulin. The dimerization of tubulin monomers was confirmed by western blot analysis. When combined under appropriate conditions, these recombinant α- and β-tubulins were capable of polymerizing into microtubules. Accessibility of cysteine residues of tubulin revealed that important ligand binding sites were folded correctly. This recombinant tubulin could serve as a control of phytotoxicity of selected antimitotic fungicide compounds during in vitro screening experiments.
2055243976	Abstract The ATP phosphohydrolase of isolated mitochondria and microsomes from embryonic chick ventricles was studied at different stages of development. At 12 days of embryonic age the particulate fractions contribute at least 85–90% of the total Mg-activated ATP phosphohydrolase activity of the whole ventricle homogenate, the myofibrils contribute the remainder. A typical myocardial cation transfer ATP phosphohydrolase is demonstrated in the microsomal fraction: a Mg-activated ATP phosphohydrolase stimulated by Na,K and Na + K and inhibited by ouabian at concentrations which also inhibit active transport of Na and K. The induction of this transfer ATP phosphohydrolase is believed to occur between 4 and 7 days of embryonic development.
2055244050	We report the capacity of CD40 ligand (CD40L)-negative T cell clones to activate human B cells. CD40L-negative T cells induce a level of B cell proliferation 10-20% of that seen with normal T cells. The signal provided by the negative clones is synergistic with that derived from a CD40L transfectant, and restores B cell proliferation to normal levels, showing that CD40L-negative T cell clones are not inherently inhibitory for B cells. Although their capacity to induce proliferation was much reduced, CD40L-negative T cell clones were still strong inducers of B cell differentiation to plasma cells. This differentiation to plasma cells was inhibited by a CD40L transfectant. The data are discussed with regard to the normal in vivo mechanism for maintaining B cell memory and memory antibody responses to T-dependent antigens.
2055244058	Abstract Worldwide molluscs of the genera Lymnaea , Pseudosuccinea , Galba and Stagnicola act as intermediate hosts of the common liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica . Galba truncatula is the only recorded intermediate host of F. hepatica within Ireland and is the principle intermediate host within Europe. To investigate the transmission of liver fluke on the Teagasc hill sheep farm, Co. Mayo, Ireland, snail species other than G. truncatula , were collected from the lowland pasture (snail sp. ‘A’) in May ( n  = 23) and from the hill area (snail sp. ‘B’) in March, April and May 2008 ( n  = 78, 53 and 36 respectively). Morphological characteristics identified snail sp. ‘A’ as a Succinea sp. and snail sp. ‘B’ as Radix peregra . PCR and subsequent sequencing of the 18S gene and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) region of the snail rDNA were used for molecular identification. The 18S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) sequences revealed a 99% similarity with Omalonyx matheroni (Succineidae) for snail sp. ‘A’, and for snail sp. ‘B’ a 99% and 98% similarity with Radix auricularia and R. peregra , respectively. The ITS-2 sequences of snail sp. ‘B’ revealed a 100% similarity with R. peregra. Using PCR F. hepatica DNA was identified in 73.9% ( n  = 17) of snail sp. ‘A’ collected during May and 10.3% ( n  = 8), 60.4% ( n  = 32) and 61.1% ( n  = 22) of snail sp. ‘B’ collected during March, April and May, respectively. A priori knowledge of habitat preference and environmental tolerances of G. truncatula has failed to explain the prevalence of infection recorded in the hill sheep flock on Teagasc hill sheep farm. These findings may explain the presence of infection in sheep populations grazing hill habitats considered too acidic to maintain G. truncatula populations.

2055244178	Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) are present in ~2.6x10⁶ individuals worldwide. Concerning their clinical consequences as well as their chromosomal origin and shape, sSMCs are a heterogeneous group of derivative chromosomes; 70% of sSMC carriers are clinically normal. In the present study, we report on a female with mosaicism (45%) of a de novo sSMC derived from chromosome 7, in which the observed clinical signs do not correspond to comparable cases in the literature. She is clinically normal apart from problems in gender determination, a uterus without ovaries and an external penis, pointing overall towards an adrenogenital syndrome (AGS). 21-Hydroxylase deficiency (21-OHD) is the most common cause of AGS. A corresponding analysis for underlying mutations in the CYP21A2 gene revealed a homozygous mutation c.518T>A (p.Ile173Asn) inherited from both non-related parents. Overall, in this study, we report a unique case of female pseudohermaphroditism, classified as a simple virilization form of 21-OHD having an additional minute-shaped chromosome 7 [min(7)(:p11.1->q11.23:)]. Notably, AGS was due to a mutation in the CYP21A2 gene located on chromosome 6. This is a further example that detection of an sSMC does not always resolve the clinical case.
2055244180	Mitochondria are the most important sensor for apoptosis. Extracellular adenosine is well reported to induce apoptosis of tumor cells. Here we found that extracellular adenosine suppresses the cell growth by induction of apoptosis in BEL-7404 liver cancer cells, and identified a novel mechanism that extracellular adenosine triggers apoptosis by increasing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) production and mitochondrial membrane dysfunction in the cells. We observed that adenosine increases ROS production, activates c-Caspase-8 and -9 and Caspase effectors, c-Caspase-3 and c-PARP, induces accumulation of apoptosis regulator Bak, decreases Bcl-xL and Mcl-1, and causes the mitochondrial membrane dysfunction and the release of DIABLO, Cytochrome C, and AIF from mitochondria to cytoplasm in the cells; ROS inhibitor, NAC significantly reduces adenosine-induced ROS production; it also shows the same degree of blocking adenosine-induced loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) and apoptosis. Our study first observed that adenosine increases ROS production in tumor cells and identified the positive feedback loop for ROS-mediated mitochondrial membrane dysfunction which amplifies the death signals in the cells. Our findings indicated ROS production and mitochondrial dysfunction play a key role in adenosine-induced apoptosis of 7404 cells.
2055244193	Reciprocal intraspecific crosses of diploid and tetraploid Trifolium pratense L. and reciprocal interspecific crosses of 4N T. pratense and T. medium were attempted in conjunction with a 40 °C temperature treatment on the female parent. The temperature treatment was found to be of little benefit in interspecific and intraspecific hybridization attempts. No cytologically verified interspecific hybrids were found from either heat-treated or non-heat-treated crosses. Intraspecific crosses produced no viable triploid offspring. One seedling was found to possess 17 chromosomes but died before positive verifications could be made. However, several seedlings from male-sterile diploid × tetraploid crosses were found to possess 28 chromosomes. These resulting tetraploids were cross compatible with other tetraploids.
2055244263	The guinea pig (Cavia porcellus) has been used as a laboratory animal since the late 18th century and still remains essential in many research areas. It also plays an important role in the Andes societies as a source of protein for many low-income highlanders and as part of rituals and traditional medicines. Thus, the conservation of genetic diversity is a long-term issue that must be considered. To establish an embryo cryobank, it is necessary to develop a method of embryo transfer. Up to now no pregnancies after surgical embryo transfer into synchronized females have been reported in guinea pigs. The aim of this work was to design a standard embryo transfer method in this species. Eight normally cycling female guinea pigs from the Maria-Marcela Farm (Puente Piedra, Peru), weighing from 1 to 1.5 kg, were used in this study. Females were housed under farming conditions and fed on commercial pellets and tap water ad libitum. Three donor females were superovulated using 15 IU of human menopausal gonadotrophin (hMG, Massone®, Buenos Aires, Argentina) and mated as soon as the vagina opened. Copulatory plug was observed and vaginal smears were taken to guarantee successful mating. Thirty-eight embryos were collected between Days 3.5 and 4.5 after ovulation at the morula and early blastocyst stages. Five recipient females were synchronized by a daily 0.1-mL dose of altrenogest (Regumate® Equine, Intervet, France) per os by means of a syringe for 15 days. Two embryos were transferred into each uterine horn by laparotomy at Day 3.5 and 4.5 after ovulation. Two types of pipettes were tested for embryo transfer: pulled glass pipettes approximately 0.3 mm in diameter in 2 female recipients and plastic open pulled straws (OPS, Minitub®, Germany) in 3 recipients. Pregnancy diagnosis was detected by observation of no return to oestrus at Day 16 and confirmed by ultrasonography. None of the 3 OPS-transferred females were pregnant. One of the 2 pulled glass pipette–transferred females was diagnosed as pregnant and delivered 2 stillbirths (one per uterine horn). There were no postsurgical complications and the females undergoing embryo transfer returned to normal reproduction. We demonstrated that a classic surgical embryo transfer method is possible under field conditions to obtain pregnancy in this species. We suggest further studies using glass pipettes, which allow a more precise embryo deposition. Future experiments will incorporate the transfer of frozen-thawed embryos on a larger scale.
2398632817	The aim of the study was the morphometric evaluation of tissue and cell composition of brain structures which are involved into transplantation in experimental model of parkinsonism in the rat-substantia nigra as the implanted structure and caudate-putamen as the host structure into which the graft is placed. Three parts of caudate-putamen (anterior, medial and posterior), three parts of substantia nigra (compact, reticular and lateral) as well as pallidum were investigated in 7-day-old rat. It was found that the density of nerve cells is highest in medial part (2236/l mm2), lower in anterior part (2129/1 mm2) and the lowest in posterior one (1842/1 mm2). The number of giant neurons in relation to the rest of neurons in anterior, medial and posterior parts of caudate-putamen was 1:268, 1:147 and 1:545 respectively. This indicates that the numbers of complexes formed by giant neurons with other neurons vary depending on the area of this brain structure. The zonal differences in distribution and size of neurons in caudate-putamen should be taken in account in qualitative and quantitative studies.
2398632823	In 70 sexually mature male and femal Rana temporaria frogs captured in natural habitat, mean nuclear volumes for the cells of the pars ependymalis and pars parenchymalis of the organon vasculosum laminae terminalis (OVLT) were determined in seven characteristic stages in life. The mean nuclear volume for the cells of the pars ependymalis and pars parenchymalis of the OVLT showed distinct annual fluctuation. Maximum nuclear volume of the cells in both investigated parts of the OVLT were observed during the breeding period (Ist decade of April), and minimum volume of the nuclei of the pars ependymalis at the beginning of hibernation (IIIrd decade of October), and in the pars parenchymalis near the end of active life (Ist decade of September).
2398632932	A real-time method of detecting the presence and/or amount of a methylated or unmethylated gene of interest in a DNA-containing sample, comprises the steps of: (a) contacting the DNA-containing sample with a reagent which selectively modifies unmethylated cytosine residues in the DNA to produce detectable modified residues but which does not modify methylated cytosine residues (b) amplifying at least a portion of the methylated or unmethylated gene of interest using at least one primer pair, at least one primer of which is designed to bind only to the sequence of methylated or unmethylated DNA following treatment with the reagent, wherein at least one primer in the primer pair produces a detectable fluorescence signal during amplification which is detected in real-time (c) quantifying the results of the real-time detection against a standard curve for the methylated or unmethylated gene of interest to produce an output of gene copy number.
2398632956	Severe combined immunodeficiencies (SCIDs) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterized by profound compromise of both T lymphocyte and B lymphocyte numbers and/or function. From a descriptive standpoint, SCID can be categorized based on the composition of the peripheral blood lymphocyte populations observed in affected patients. While many forms of SCID present with both T cell and B cell lymphopenia (T − B − SCID), in one group of such disorders B cell differentiation is conserved and normal or even elevated numbers of peripheral blood B lymphocytes can be observed. These diseases are called SCID T − B + and include the X-linked form of SCID (SCIDX-1), the deficiency of Janus kinase family member 3 (JAK3-SCID), and the defect of expression of the alpha chain of the interleukin-7 receptor (IL7-Rα-SCID). This article describes the main features of these rare clinical entities.
2398632978	Certain species of winter migratory waterfowl in San-in District, western Japan, were surveyed for influenza virus from November 1983 to March 1984. Faeces of the waterfowl were collected regularly at five stations. Eleven influenza A viruses including H5N3 and H10N4 subtypes were isolated from 450 faecal samples from whistling swans, 28 viruses including H2N2 and H10N4 subtypes were isolated from 362 faecal samples from pintails; and subtype H13N6 was isolated from 240 faecal samples of black-tailed gulls.
2398633178	The golden hamster is a well-established model system for studies of morphology, reproductive physiology, oncology, genetics and virology. The aim of this study was to establish experimental protocols necessary for cloning the golden hamster; we examined and optimized conditions for parthenogenesis and cleavage of its oocytes. We tested oocytes of different ages, including 15 h after Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), with two treatments: (1) an electrical pulse ranging from 10 to 600 V/mm and (2) incubation for 2 to 6 h in 2 mM 6-dimethylaminopurine (6-DMAP). These two conditions were tested both separately and in combination. We found that (i) in oocytes of different ages, cleavage exhibits a strength-dependent increase; (ii) 6-DMAP stimulates oocyte cleavage, but the cleavage rates are significantly low; and (iii) a combined treatment is more effective than a treatment with 6-DMAP alone, and is comparable to those achieved with high pulse stimuli. These results elucidate certain parameters important for the cloning of the golden hamster species.
3149571115	The germplasm resources of Haliotis diversicolor supertexta are declining in South China.To solve this problem,we chose 2 small abalone populations from Shanwei cultured stock(BD) and Shenzhen wild stock(YS) as parents to make complete diallel cross and built 4 mating combinations,whose heterosis and combining ability of growth traits(shell length,shell width and body weight) were analyzed at 120 dph,150 dph,210 dph and 270 dph,respectively.The ranges of the mid-parent heterosis on hybrids shell length,width and body weight were 5.3 ~ 17.0,6.3 ~ 15.3 and 7.8 ~ 9.0,respectively;and the ranges of heterobeltiosis were- 1.0 ~ 11.2,- 1.2 ~ 6.6 and- 10.9 ~ 4.1,respectively.The reciprocal crosses had higher mid-parent heterosis compared with the orthogonal combination.The GCA effects of each growth stage of BD groups were negative values(- 0.19 ~- 0.09,- 0.11 ~- 0.07 and- 0.40 ~- 0.24),while the YS groups were positive values(0.09 ~ 0.19,0.07 ~ 0.11 and 0.24 ~ 0.40).The specific combining ability(SCA) effects of YS group and BD group at each growth stage were 0.01 ~ 0.14,0 ~ 0.07 and 0.02 ~ 0.07,respectively.The general combining ability(GCA),SCA and maternal effects of BD group were all less than those of YS group,which shows that increasing the quantities of the wild population in the mating parents can improve the growth performance of H.diversicolor supertexta effectively.

2398633322	Identification of Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) was made using three DNA probe tests for MAC: Gen-Probe Rapid Diagnostic System for the MAC (Gen-Probe Inc., San Diego, U.S.A.), AccuProbe MAC Culture Identification or Confirmation Test (Gen-Probe Inc.); and SNAP Culture Identification Diagnostic Kit (MAC) (Syngene Inc., San Diego, U.S.A.). Various strains of MAC belonging to serovars 21 to 28 were identified by the DNA probe tests and showed the following. First, Serovar 21 and 25 belonged to M. avium and M. intracellulare, respectively. Each of them reacted with species-specific probes used in the three DNA probe tests [i.e., either M. avium-probe (in SNAP test; Probe A) or M. intracellulare-probe (in SNAP test; Probe I)]. Second, serovars 22-24 and 26-28 consisted of M. intracellulare, MAC strains that reacted with Probe X of SNAP test but lacked the reactivity with M. avium- and M. intracellulare probes of all the DNA probe tests, M. scrofulaceum that showed no reactivity with M. avium- or M. intracellulare-probe or Probe X, and M. scrofulaceum that had only the reactivity with Probe X. When the disease-associated MAC strains (35 strains), isolated in the Kanto to Kyushu areas in Japan, were identified using AccuProbe test, both the M. avium and M. intracellulare strains identified by the Gen-Probe test reacted with the MAC-probe but not with the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC)-probe.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)
2398633566	The purpose of this study was to determine the timing of p53 overexpression during the development of oral squamous cell carcinomas. Immunohistochemical analysis of p53 expression was performed on 107 cases of oral squamous cell carcinoma, 37 cases of leukoplakia, and 10 cases of cancer-free patient's normal oral mucosa samples. 43 of the 107 (40.2%) oral squamous cell carcinomas showed p53 overespression. There was no relationship between p53-overexpression and clinicopathological factors, such as size of tumors, lymph node metastasis, hostological differentiation and prognosis. Overexpression of p53 was not detected in 10 normal mucosa. Seven out of 37 (18.7%) samples of leukoplakia and 15 out of 43 (34.8%) samples of noncancerous epithelium adjacent to the p53-positive carcinomas showed p53 overexpression. the results demonstrate that p53 protein may have an important role in the early stages of oral tumorigenesis.
2398633606	A novel soybean cultivar, designated 93918432, is disclosed. The invention relates to the seeds of soybean cultivar 93918432, to the plants of soybean 93918432 and to methods for producing a soybean plant produced by crossing the cultivar 93918432 with itself or another soybean variety. The invention further relates to hybrid soybean seeds and plants produced by crossing the cultivar 93918432 with another soybean cultivar.
2398633608	Leptin is small cytokine-like protein that is involved in appetite and body weight regulation. Due to increased interest in using leptin as an anti-obesity reagent, recombinant forms of leptin have been produced for several species, including humans, mice, rats, pigs, dogs, sheep etc. The biological activities of such recombinant proteins were determined using various in vitro or in vivo systems; however so far, no specific assay system for rat leptin is available. Since rats are representative animal models in obesity research, the establishment of a biological assay system for determining rat leptin activity has been eagerly awaited. This study describes the generation of such a system using chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-cells that were transfected with the long form of the rat leptin receptor isoform, OB-Rb, whereby a signal transduces and activators of transcription-sensitive luciferase reporter system is further employed to quantify the leptin-mediated signals. This system is the first rat-specific leptin bioassay system that has been reported. It is expected that this assay will be used to further quantify and determine leptin activity from various biological fluids and sources.
2398633609	1) A great amount of glycogen is present in the syncytium of the villus and in the fibroblastic and Hoffbauer's cells of the mesenchymal core. 2) PAS-positive diastase-insoluble material, probably to be ascribed to the chorionic glycoprotein, is present, on the other hand, in the syncytial collar and in the basal region of the syncytial cytoplasm. 3) The higly argyrophil reticulum of the villus stroma is PAS-negative.
2398633864	This special issue includes four reviews and four original research articles focusing on the physiological and pathological role of DNA damage and repair mechanisms, synaptic plasticity, and neurodegeneration. Moreover, the emerging roles played in memory and neurodegeneration by different factors involved in the stress response, chromatin remodeling, and nucleolar function are specifically addressed. Finally, the present collection includes articles outlining current treatments for neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Niemann-Pick type C disease (NPC).  Unrepaired DNA lesions and deficiencies in DNA repair systems are implicated in the progressive neuronal loss observed in many neurodegenerative pathologies although neuronal DNA damage and repair may also play a role in cognitive function and dysfunction. The formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), the most lethal form of DNA damage, may be a physiological process that modifies chromatin organization and gene expression involved in information processing, learning, and memory and may be caused by normal brain activity. Conversely, pathologically elevated β-amyloid peptide (Aβ), a major culprit for the pathogenesis of AD, worsens DNA damage by eliciting aberrant synaptic activity.  We still have limited understanding of the precise molecular mechanisms underlying failures in memory formation and consolidation and the synaptic dysfunction associated with the early onset of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, this special issue aims to contribute to the knowledge on these mechanisms involved in both cognitive impairment and neurodegeneration to indicate novel therapeutic targets.  In the review article by L. Narciso et al., “The Response to Oxidative DNA Damage in Neurons: Mechanisms and Disease,” the authors outline the notion that the mechanisms controlling genome stability are of key importance in the development and function of the nervous system. They discuss and present different neurological diseases characterized by impairment of DNA repair pathways focusing on base excision repair (BER). Moreover, they stress the evidence that the mechanisms controlling DNA damage in neurons may vary depending on the brain region and suggest the need for further investigation to determine whether differences in the response to DNA damage underlie the brain-region selectivity observed in neurodegenerative diseases.  Factors known to function in DNA recombination/repair machineries have been shown to play a role in long-term memory (LTM). The research article by E. Castro-Perez et al., “Identification and Characterization of the V(D)J Recombination Activating Gene 1 in Long-Term Memory of Context Fear Conditioning,” reports that the V(D)J recombination activating gene 1 (RAG1), which encodes a factor that introduces DSBs in immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes, is induced in the amygdala, but not in the hippocampus, after context fear conditioning. In functional studies, ablation of RAG1 expression causes a significant impairment in LTM, thus suggesting that RAG1 may play a role in LTM consolidation. This work further supports the notion that DNA recombination/repair machineries might be involved in learning and memory processes. Interestingly, the authors suggest that an integrated control of the introduction of DSBs, DNA repair, DNA rearrangement, epigenetics, and transcriptional and translational mechanisms may orchestrate gene regulation in memory formation.  Aβ is the key player in the amyloid-cascade hypothesis of AD which appears to be associated with DSB induction in aging and AD. The article by E. Gruz-Gibelli et al., “The Vitamin A Derivative All-Trans Retinoic Acid Repairs Amyloid-β-Induced Double-Strand Breaks in Neural Cells and in the Murine Neocortex,” indicates a role of all-trans retinoic acid (RA), a derivative of vitamin A, in the repair of Aβ-induced DBSs. The authors test the DNA and the cellular protection activity of RA both on neuronal SH-SY5Y cells and on astrocytic DI TNC1 cells and, in addition, on extracts from cortex of young and old mice. The authors suggest that RA, besides increasing cell viability in the cortex of young and aged mice, might also target DNA repair of genes involved in synaptic maintenance. Therefore, exploring mechanisms involved in Aβ-induced DSBs might provide additional means to target pathological Aβ-induced changes.  Epigenetic silencing of rDNA by DNA methylation is a common feature of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and AD and it is considered an emerging disease marker. Interestingly, rDNA silencing in the nucleolus perturbs diverse nucleolar functions including global chromatin regulation and biogenesis of ribosomes. Among the chromatin-remodeling enzymes, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1 (PARP-1) may control synaptic plasticity and memory consolidation by regulating the expression of immediate early genes and rDNA transcription. Recently, it has been shown that the maintenance of the late phase of long-term potentiation (L-LTP), a model for long-term memory, requires nucleolar integrity and the expression of new rRNAs. The research article by J. Zeng et al., “Nucleolar PARP-1 Expression Is Decreased in Alzheimer's Disease: Consequences for Epigenetic Regulation of rDNA and Cognition,” shows that the nucleolar PARP-1 may be a sensitive marker of synaptic deficits in AD. The authors suggest a novel role for PARP-1 dysregulation in AD pathology by showing that PARP-1 positive nucleolar staining in CA1 and CA4 hippocampal pyramidal neurons of AD patients is significantly reduced compared to controls. They also propose an intriguing model in which the loss of nucleolar PARP-1, resulting in DNA methyltransferase activation, might account for the rDNA silencing observed in AD.  AD is a complex multifactorial disorder which may require complex approaches to treatment. Early disease detection, combination therapies, and lifestyle choices are all likely contributors to the successful eradication of the pathology. In the review article “Current Research Therapeutic Strategies for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment,” J. Folch et al. consider the effectiveness of treatments aimed at reducing Aβ production through both the inhibition of β and γ secretase enzymes and the dissolution of existing cerebral Aβ plaques to be modest. Interestingly, they present alternative strategies centered on the inhibition of the downstream Aβ signaling, particularly acting at synaptic level. The interaction of Aβ and prion protein (PrPC) activates Fyn kinase which then modifies synaptic signaling through NMDA glutamate receptors. This mechanism underlies excitotoxicity and dendritic spine loss. Thus, the authors propose Fyn kinase blockers Masitinib and Saracatinib as effective molecules in treating AD symptoms in experimental mouse models of the disease. In fact, Saracatinib is currently in Phase II and Masitinib is in Phase III clinical trials for mild-to-moderate AD.  In the research paper by G. D'Arcangelo et al., “Miglustat Reverts the Impairment of Synaptic Plasticity in a Mouse Model of NPC Disease,” the authors investigate in NPC, a rare disease with progressive neurological deterioration and cognitive decline until severe dementia, the mechanism of action of Miglustat, a recent approved drug for the treatment of the disease. In particular, they study synaptic plasticity phenomena and evaluate ERKs activation in the hippocampus of NPC1−/− mice, a well described animal model of the disease. The authors show an impairment of LTP in NPC1−/− mouse slices which is associated with lack of ERKs phosphorylation. They also find that in vivo Miglustat administration in NPC1−/− mice can rescue synaptic plasticity deficits, restore ERKs activation, and counteract hyperexcitability. Overall, these data indicate that Miglustat may be effective for treating the neurological deficits associated with NPC, such as seizures and dementia.  Parkinson's disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder. This is characterized by the progressive loss of midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) and the presence of α-synuclein-containing protein aggregates termed Lewy bodies (and/or Lewy neurites) in affected neurons. Several transcription factors, playing a role in development and survival of mDA neurons, might be involved in the progressive loss of these neurons. The review article “Neuroprotective Transcription Factors in Animal Models of Parkinson Disease” by F.-X. B. de The et al. reports mechanisms by which these transcription factors control neuronal survival and activity, including genomic stability and synaptic maintenance. The authors suggest that a better understanding of these modes of action could help to identify novel neuroprotective approaches, for example, based on direct protein delivery strategies.  In the review article “Chronic Stress and Glucocorticoids: From Neuronal Plasticity to Neurodegeneration,” S. Vyas and collaborators discuss the cause-effect relationships between prolonged stress, elevated levels of glucocorticoids (GCs), and cognitive/mood related disorders including AD and PD. Particularly, the authors present a comprehensive view on the cellular mechanisms through which stress and GCs may influence the pathogenesis of AD and PD.   We believe that this special issue, by focusing on DNA damage/repair mechanisms involved in learning and memory and neurodegeneration, will be instrumental to identify new potential approaches to design effective therapeutic strategies.

2943213490	This study aimed to determine the genetic diversity of antibiotics and plants extract resistant Staphylococcus aureus using molecular technique. A total of 106 human clinical samples were collected from patients in three different hospitals within Ekiti State. Microbiological and molecular analyses were performed using standard methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility test with common antibiotics and plant leaves extracts was carried out using disk and agar well diffusion methods. Urine samples from male patients recorded high percentage of S. aureus (57.1%) as compared to the female patients (43.1%). Percentage of S. aureus recorded from the ear swab samples in male patients (58.3%) was also high as compared to the female (41.7%). From the nose swab samples, female patients recorded 60% as compared to their male counterpart (40%). Equal percentage (50%) of wound infection caused by S. aureus was observed in both male and female patients. Of the eight antibiotics used in this study, the S. aureus isolated were susceptible to ofloxacin (25 to 36 mm), gentamycin (16 to 23 mm) and erythromycin (11 to 25 mm). All the isolates confirmed resistance to ceftaxidime and cloxacillin. Nine isolates were susceptible to cefuroxime with zones of inhibition that ranged from 10 to 25 mm, while 11 were susceptible to ceftriaxone with zone of inhibition between 11 and 20 mm. Only one isolate was sensitive to augmentin (amoxicillin/clavulanate) with zone of inhibition of 20 mm. Out of three plant extracts used in this study, aqueous leaf extract of Terminalia catappa demonstrated highest antibacterial activity on the test isolates with zone of inhibition of 16 to 36 mm followed by Mangifera indica with inhibition ranging from 11 to 32 mm, while least inhibition ranging from 11 to 20 mm was exhibited by Acalypha wikesiena. Random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) proved to be useful as genetic markers in determining genetic diversity among antibiotic and plant extract resistant S. aureus.       Key words: Acalypha wikesiena, multidrug-resistant strains, Staphylococcus aureus, genetic diversity.
2943213507	The Slug-E-cadherin axis plays a critical role in non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) where aberrant upregulation of Slug promotes cancer metastasis. Now, the post-translational modifications of Slug and their regulation mechanisms still remain unclear in lung cancer. Hence, exploring the protein linkage map of Slug is of great interest for investigating the scenario of how Slug protein is regulated in lung cancer metastasis. The Slug associated proteins, Ubc9 and SUMO-1, were identified using yeast two-hybrid screening; and in vitro SUMOylation assays combined with immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting were performed to explore the detail events and regulations of Slug SUMOylation. The functional effects of SUMOylation on Slug proteins were examined by EMSA, reporter assay, ChIP assay, RT-PCR, migration and invasion assays in vitro, tail vein metastatic analysis in vivo, and also evaluated the association with clinical outcome of NSCLC patients. Slug protein could interact with Ubc9 and SUMO-1 and be SUMOylated in cells. Amino acids 130–212 and 33–129 of Slug are responsible for its binding to Ubc9 and protein inhibitor of activated STAT (PIAS)y, respectively. SUMOylation could enhance the transcriptional repression activity of Slug via recruiting more HDAC1, resulting in reduced expression of downstream Slug target genes and enhanced lung cancer metastasis. In addition, hypoxia could increase Slug SUMOylation through attenuating the interactions of Slug with SENP1 and SENP2. Finally, high expression Slug and Ubc9 levels were associated with poor overall survival among NSCLC patients. Ubc9/PIASy-mediated Slug SUMOylation and subsequent HDAC1 recruitment may play a crucial role in hypoxia-induced lung cancer progression, and these processes may serve as therapeutic targets for NSCLC.
2398634343	Although the analysis of genetic interactions and networks is a powerful approach to understanding biology, it has not been applied widely to the pathogenic yeast Candida albicans Here, we describe the use of both screening and directed genetic interaction studies based on complex haploinsufficiency to probe the function of the R: egulation of A: ce2 and M: orphogenesis (RAM) pathway in C. albicans A library of 5200 Tn7-mutagenized derivatives of a parental strain heterozygous at CBK1, the key kinase in the RAM pathway, was screened for alterations in serum-induced filamentation. Following confirmation of phenotypes and identification of insertion sites by sequencing, a set of 36 unique double heterozygous strains showing complex haploinsufficiency was obtained. In addition to a large set of genes regulated by the RAM transcription factor Ace2, genes related to cell wall biosynthesis, cell cycle, polarity, oxidative stress, and nitrogen utilization were identified. Follow-up analysis led to the first demonstration that the RAM pathway is required for oxidative stress tolerance in a manner related to the two-component-regulated kinase Chk1 and revealed a potential direct connection between the RAM pathway and the essential Mps1 spindle pole-related kinase. In addition, genetic interactions with CDC42-related genes MSB1, a putative scaffold protein, and RGD3, a putative Rho GTPase-activating protein (GAP) were identified. We also provide evidence that Rgd3 is a GAP for Cdc42 and show that its localization and phosphorylation are dependent on Cbk1.
2398634420	The serum levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase, alkaline phosphatase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase in healthy male dromedary camels were determined. The camels were then infected with Trypanosoma evansi and the same enzymes determined at intervals, both during the period of infection and after treatment with the trypanocidal drugs suramin and quinapyramine sulphate. Increases in the serum levels of sorbitol dehydrogenase, glutamic pyruvic transaminase and glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase were recorded, together with a decrease in the serum level of alkaline phosphatase during the period of patent parasitaemia. The levels of the enzymes returned to normal after drug treatment.
2398634511	Nontransformed stromal colony-derived cell lines (CDCLs) consist of a pure stromal cell population that differentiates following a vascular smooth-muscle cell repertoire. Here we study the maintenance of hematopoiesis by this cell population. We show that CDCLs allow the generation for several weeks of stroma-adherent colonies (comprising a cobblestone area) from CD34+, CD34+/CD38+, and CD34+/CD38- cells. Stroma-adherent colony-forming cells (CFCs) from CD34+/CD38- cells reach a maximum at week 4 and limiting dilution analysis gives a frequency of 1 per 10 cells seeded; in contrast to this, CFCs from CD34+/CD38+ cells are optimal by week 2 and the frequency is then only 1 per 120 cells seeded. Stroma-adherent colonies comprise hematopoietic cells from all lineages except the T lymphocytic, with a majority of granulomonocytes. CDCLs also allow the amplification of granulomonocytic colony-forming units (CFU-GMs), since cumulative outputs of CFU-GMs by week 6 are 190 and 8 times that observed at culture inception for the CD34+/CD38- and CD34+/CD38+ cell populations, respectively. Our results suggest that stromal cells from CDCLs allow the maintenance of primitive hematopoietic precursors and induce their proliferation and differentiation. This study underscores the potential role of one of the microenvironmental cell populations, that of myoid cells, in the regulation of hematopoietic precursor behavior.
2398634560	The method of testing the affect of neuroactive agents on cellular receptors is disclosed. The procedures comprise decapitating an invertebrate, in the disclosed tests a Drosophila melanogaster is used. A selected neuroactive agent is applied directly to the severed nerve cord of the invertebrate. The reaction of the invertebrate is observed in response to the application of the agent. The reaction of the invertebrate is an indication of the activities of the cellular receptors which react to the specific agents. The tested agents include dopamine, serotonin and octopamine and vertebrate drugs that act as D1-like receptor agonists, D1-like receptor antagonists, D2-like receptor agonists and D2-like receptor antagonist, and a vertebrate monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Other types of neuroactive agents are also used.
2398634572	Objective: The study was designed to explore the association of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with VHL (rs779805), MTHFR (rs1801133) and APOE (rs8106822 and rs405509) polymorphisms, investigate the interactions among the single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and explore roles of the interactions in the pathogenesis of RCC in Chinese Han population. Methods: 81 RCC patients and 80 healthy controls were included in the study. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and direct sequencing methods were used in the analysis on the genotypes of APOE, VHL and MTHFR gene polymorphisms. Multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method was adopted to conduct gene-gene interaction analysis. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were utilized to evaluate the correlation between gene-gene interactions and RCC risk. Results: Significant correlations were found between RCC risk and 3 SNPs (rs8106822, rs779805 and rs1801133). Genotype AA and allele A of APOE rs8106822 were significantly associated with RCC susceptibility (OR=2.65, 95% CI=1.05-6.69). Meanwhile, we found that the frequencies of genotype GG and allele G were much higher in case group, compared with controls (P<0.05 for both) and they appeared to be risk factors for RCC (OR=2.90, 95% CI=1.22-6.87; OR=1.78, 95% CI=1.14-2.27). While, allele T of MTHFR rs1801133 could decrease the risk of RCC (OR=0.62, 95% CI=0.40-0.97). MDR analysis showed that gene-gene interactions among APOE, VHL and MTHFR SNPs were closely related with RCC susceptibility. Conclusion: APOE, VHL and MTHFR gene polymorphisms were related to the risk of RCC. The interactions among APOE, VHL and MTHFR genes could increase the risk of RCC.
2398634580	Ciliates are of special interest owing to the multiplicity and diversity of their microtubule organizing centers (MTOCs). The subcellular localization of gamma-tubulin in these protozoa has not been extensively studied. The cloning of a gamma-tubulin gene in Euplotes (Liang, A., K. Heckmann, Gene 136, 319-322 (1993) led us to examine the localization of this protein. We used three polyclonal antibodies, JH46, R58 and R70. They had been raised against peptides common to mammalian and Aspergillus gamma-tubulins. These regions had 69%, 95%, and 75% identity with the corresponding regions of Euplotes gamma-tubulin. Immunoblotting (R70) revealed a polypeptide corresponding to the molecular mass of Euplotes gamma-tubulin. In Euplotes octocarinatus, gamma-tubulin was detected by immunofluorescence (R70) in the basal bodies, the micronucleus and the macronucleus throughout the cell cycle. The presence of gamma-tubulin in basal bodies and micronuclei was confirmed with the other two antibodies JH46 and R58. The permanent association of gamma-tubulin with basal bodies was also observed in Tetrahymena thermophila and Paramecium tetraurelia, two ciliates distantly related to Euplotes. These results not only extend to ciliates the finding that gamma-tubulin is permanently associated with ciliary basal bodies, but also demonstrate that gamma-tubulin is present in unconventional MTOCs.
2398634593	Background: Over the last decade, we have witnessed an incredible growth in the field of exome and genome sequencing. This information can be used to predict phenotypes for a number of traits of medical relevance. Here, we have focused on the identification of blood cell traits, developing BOOGIE, a tool recognizing relevant mutations through genome analysis and interpreting them in several blood traits important for transfusions. Results: In our method, we extract relevant mutation data and annotate a genome with ANNOVAR. These variants are then directly compared with our knowledge base, containing association rules between mutations and phenotypes for the ten major blood groups: ABO, Rh, Duffy, Kell, Diego, Kidd, Lewis, Lutheran, MNS and Bombay. Whenever a match is found, it is used to predict the related phenotype and list causative mutations. The decision process is implemented as an expert system, automatically performing the logical reasoning connected to the genome variants. Interactions with other proteins and enzymes are easily kept into account during the full process, e.g. for the Bombay phenotype. This rare and easily misclassified genetic trait involves three blood groups, making blood donations potentially lethal. Conclusions: BOOGIE was tested on Personal Genome Project (PGP) data. The blood traits for genomes with available ABO and Rh annotation were correctly predicted in between 86% and 100% of cases. The analysis is very efficient, making it suitable for genome scale diagnostic applications in personalized medicine. The versatility and simplicity of the analysis make it easily interpretable and allows easy extension of the protocol towards other blood related traits.
2055244287	Cell walls harbor proteins and polysaccharides able to condition the development of a plant. In the past year, genes and enzymes modulating the composition and physical properties of walls have been characterized, and wall composition has been linked to the way a cell interacts with another cell, and to the way in which it differentiates. The sum of the signaling and physical activities of a cell wall may explain much about the control of development.
2055244293	BACKGROUND Human tuberculosis (TB) in West Africa is not only caused by M. tuberculosis but also by bacteria of the two lineages of M. africanum. For instance, in The Gambia, 40% of TB is due to infections with M. africanum West African 2. This bacterial lineage is associated with HIV infection, reduced ESAT-6 immunogenicity and slower progression to active disease. Although these characteristics suggest an attenuated phenotype of M. africanum, no underlying mechanism has been described. From the first descriptions of M. africanum in the literature in 1969, the time to a positive culture of M. africanum on solid medium was known to be longer than the time to a positive culture of M. tuberculosis. However, the delayed growth of M. africanum, which may correlate with the less virulent phenotype in the human host, has not previously been studied in detail. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS We compared the growth rates of M. tuberculosis and M. africanum isolates from The Gambia in two liquid culture systems. M. africanum grows significantly slower than M. tuberculosis, not only when grown directly from sputa, but also in growth experiments under defined laboratory conditions. We also sequenced four M. africanum isolates and compared their whole genomes with the published M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome. M. africanum strains have several non-synonymous SNPs or frameshift mutations in genes that were previously associated with growth-attenuation. M. africanum strains also have a higher mutation frequency in genes crucial for transport of sulphur, ions and lipids/fatty acids across the cell membrane into the bacterial cell. Surprisingly, 5 of 7 operons, recently described as essential for intracellular survival of H37Rv in the host macrophage, showed at least one non-synonymously mutated gene in M. africanum. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE The altered growth behaviour of M. africanum might indicate a different survival strategy within host cells.
2055244302	Byrne et al. (1) presented data on the superiority of cefoperazone amphotericin teicoplanin (CAT) selective medium over modified cefoperazone charcoal deoxycholate selective medium for the efficient isolation of Campylobacter upsaliensis from stools. There are alternatives to the use of selective media for the isolation of C. upsaliensis. Since 1977 we have routinely isolated campylobacters from the diarrhetic stools of pediatric patients at the Red Cross Children's Hospital, Cape Town, South Africa. In 1990, primarily for cost containment reasons, the use of antibiotic-containing selective media for Campylobacter isolation was discontinued in our laboratory and the Cape Town protocol was introduced. This isolation protocol was the first to combine both membrane filtration onto antibiotic-free blood agar plates and incubation in an H2-enhanced microaerobic atmosphere (3). With the use of this protocol, the number of stool cultures positive for campylobacteria rose to 21.8% from the 7.1% previously obtained with Skirrow's and other selective media available at that time (3). Since the introduction of the Cape Town protocol we have isolated over 1,200 strains of C. upsaliensis from the diarrhetic and normal stools of pediatric and adult patients and from dogs, cats, and meercats (2). Our laboratory could begin to isolate C. upsaliensis, Campylobacter concisus, Campylobacter curvus, Campylobacter rectus, Campylobacter sputorum biovar sputorum, Campylobacter hyointestinalis, Helicobacter fennelliae, Helicobacter cinaedi, Arcobacter butzleri, and other campylobacteria from the stools of humans and animals only with the introduction of the Cape Town protocol. Some strains of campylobacteria are sensitive to antibiotics commonly used in selective media or have an essential requirement for an H2-enhanced microaerobic atmosphere.  We have compared the efficacy of the filtration component of the Cape Town protocol with that of CAT selective medium for C. upsaliensis isolation from 300 consecutive diarrhetic stool samples from gastroenteritis patients at the Red Cross Children's Hospital (Table ​(Table1).1). The antibiotic-free filtration and CAT isolation plates were incubated under identical conditions, in an H2-enhanced microaerobic atmosphere at 37°C. Campylobacter, Helicobacter, and Arcobacter isolates were identified by recognized phenotypic and biochemical criteria. The data in Table ​Table11 indicate that with filtration onto antiobiotic-free plates, 20.3% of the stools were positive for campylobacteria, while with the use of CAT selective plates only 4.7% of the same stools were positive for campylobacteria. Both methods were equally efficient for the isolation of Campylobacter coli and A. butzleri; however, filtration was superior to CAT selective medium for all other campylobacteria isolated. Campylobacter jejuni subsp. doylei, H. fennelliae, C. hyointestinalis, and C. concisus strains were isolated with filtration but were not isolated with CAT media. Sixteen strains of C. jejuni subsp. jejuni were isolated with filtration, whereas nine strains were isolated with CAT medium. Eleven C. upsaliensis strains were obtained with filtration, but only a single C. upsaliensis strain was obtained with CAT medium. Generally, colonies of C. upsaliensis and other campylobacteria on the antibiotic-free blood agar plates used in the Cape Town protocol were larger, more prominent, and faster growing (visible growth after 2 to 4 days) than those on the CAT plates.     TABLE 1  Efficiency of filtration versus that of CAT selective medium for isolation of C. upsaliensis and related organisms from 300 consecutive diarrhetic stools of patients at the Red Cross Children's Hospital     Byrne et al. (1) state that membrane filtration is costly and labor intensive. We do not agree, as the Cape Town protocol, which has been in continuous use over the last 11 years, has proved to be a simple, efficient, and cost-effective alternative to the use of antibiotic-containing selective media for the isolation of C. upsaliensis and other campylobacteria from stool. The underdetection of C. upsaliensis and other campylobacteria in the stools of gastroenteritis patients is an important diagnostic problem, and application of the Cape Town protocol may help alleviate this concern.
2055244310	Cells transformed by the p110α-H1047R mutant of PI3K show increased tyrosine phosphorylation of Stat3. This activation of Stat3 is important for the transformation process, because a dominant-negative mutant of Stat3 interferes with PI3K-induced oncogenesis. GDC-0941, a specific inhibitor of PI3K reduces the level of Stat3 phosphorylation. The effect of PI3K on Stat3 appears to be mediated by a member of the Tec kinase family. The Tec kinase inhibitor LFM-A13 blocks Stat3 phosphorylation in H1047R-transformed cells. The Janus kinase inhibitor AG490 and the Src kinase inhibitor Src-1, as well as rapamycin, have no effect on Stat3 phosphorylation in H1047R-transformed cells. The H1047R-transformed cells also release a factor that induces Stat3 phosphorylation in normal cells with possible effects on the cellular microenvironment. In some human tumor cell lines, the enhanced phosphorylation of Stat3 is inhibited by both PI3K and by Tec kinase inhibitors, suggesting that the link between PI3K and Stat3 is significant in human cancer.
2055244351	Calumenin is a Ca(2+) binding protein localizing at the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Although it has been implicated in various diseases, the in vivo functions of calumenin are largely unknown. Here, we report that calumenin has pleiotropic roles in muscle and cuticle function in Caenorhabditis elegans. Mutant analysis revealed that the calu-1 is required for regulating fertility, locomotion and body size. In addition, calu-1 is important for two behaviors, defecation and pharyngeal pumping, consistent with its ability to bind Ca(2+). The genetic analysis further suggested the possibility that calu-1 regulates the pharyngeal pumping together with the inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) receptor encoded by itr-1. Taken together, our data suggest that calumenin is important for calcium signaling pathways in C. elegans.
2055244412	A description is given of the isolation of an amnion cell-line. The morphological and cytochemical changes of the 2nd and 4th transfers are compared. It is shown that the 4th transfer becomes insensitive to ECHO virus type 9. The growth pattern changes also, while the Sudan reaction, after having initially been markedly positive, becomes weakly positive. The alkaline phosphatase reaction, negative in the beginning, becomes positive in the 4th transfer. The amnion cells lose their specific characteristics during the adaptation. It is possible that we are dealing here with a general adaptation phenomenon.
2055244478	The quantitative 2-[14C]deoxyglucose autoradiographic method was applied to the measurement of local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose in a model of genetic petit mal-like seizures in a strain of Wistar rats. During the experimental period, epileptic rats exhibited synchronous spike-and-wave discharges recorded from the cerebral cortex, whereas the electroencephalographic pattern of control animals was normal. An overall consistent increase in local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose was observed in epileptic rats as compared to nonepileptic control rats. This increase was statistically significant in 52 of the 59 cerebral structures studied and concerned all cerebral functional systems. These results are in accordance with positron emission tomography measurements in humans with typical childhood absence epilepsy. There is a lack of anatomical correlation between areas demonstrating hypermetabolism and areas where spike-and-wave discharges are recorded. Thus, the diffuse increase in cerebral energy metabolism in epileptic rats as compared to controls is not directly related to the occurrence of spike and wave discharges.
2055244517	Quinalphos (O,O-diethyl-O-[quinoxalinyl-(2)-thionophosphate]) is a well-known organophosphorus insecticide used extensively in agriculture that adversely interferes with the activity of testicular steroidogenic enzymes in rats. To investigate its effects on spermatogenesis, the other function of testes, quantitative evaluation of different varieties of germ cells at stage VII of the seminiferous epithelium cycle, namely, type A spermatogonia (ASg), preleptotene spermatocytes (pLSc), midpachytene spermatcytes (mPSc), and step 7 spermatids (7Sd), along with the radioimmunoassay of plasma FSH, LH, testosterone, and testicular testosterone, were performed in Wistar rats following treatment with quinalphos (250 μg/kg, ip) for approximately one (13 days) and two cycles (26 days) of the seminiferous epithilium. Massive degeneration of all varieties of germ cells at stage VII, remarkable reduction in the sperm count, and significant reductions in plasma concentrations of FSH and testosterone, along with testicular testosterone, were observed after quinalphos treatment. Significant reduction in the plasma concentration of LH was observed only after treatment for two cycles. Administration of human chorionic gonadotrophin for 26 days in rats injected with quinalphos partially prevented the degeneration of germ cells and increased testosterone production. It is suggested that quinalphos may have a suppressive influence on gonadotrophin release but its direct detrimental action at the level of the testes may also be responsible for the observed changes in spermatogenesis and in testicular testosterone production in rats.
2055244519	Angelman syndrome is a neurodevelopmental disorder caused by a deficiency of the imprinted and maternally expressed UBE3A gene. Although de novo genetic and epigenetic imprinting defects of UBE3A genomic locus account for majority of Angelman diagnoses, approximately 10% of individuals affected with Angelman syndrome are a result of UBE3A loss-of-function mutations occurring on the expressed maternal chromosome. The variants described in this manuscript represent the analysis of 2,515 patients referred for UBE3A gene sequencing at our institution, along with a comprehensive review of the UBE3A mutation literature. Of these, 267 (10.62%) patients had a report issued for detection of a UBE3A gene nucleotide variant, which in many cases involved family studies resulting in reclassification of variants of unknown clinical significance (VUS). Overall, 111 (4.41%) probands had a nucleotide change classified as pathogenic or strongly favored to be pathogenic, 29 (1.15%) had a VUS, and 126 (5.0%) had a nucleotide change classified as benign or strongly favored to be benign. All variants and their clinical interpretations are submitted to NCBI ClinVar, a freely accessible human variation and phenotype database.
2055244547	Abstract Evidence is provided that isoproterenol, 4-methylcatechol and serum induce NGF by three separate mechanisms. Isoproterenol and 4-methyl-catechol induced NGF and NGF mRNA in mouse fibroblast L929 cells in either the presence or absence of serum. Propranolol prevented NGF induction by isoproterenol, but not by 4-methylcatechol or serum. All possible combinations of these inducers resulted in additive increases in the levels of NGF and NGF mRNA.
2055244552	Abstract Surveying terrestrial invertebrates often requires lethal techniques that can also kill non-target vertebrates. Removing the desirable components of biodiversity is at odds with the philosophy of ecological restoration and biodiversity conservation more generally. Moreover, commonly used metrics generated by such survey approaches (e.g. abundance and species richness) are only indirectly related to the ecosystem services (e.g. pollination) that are often of primary interest. We examined the relationship between rates of dung removal (a direct measure of an ecosystem service) and dung beetle abundance and species richness in a temperate region of New South Wales, Australia, and examined if dung removal in revegetated riparian areas of different ages were trending monotonically toward rates in areas with mature native vegetation. Pellets of pig manure and conventional traps were left at study sites for 48 h to examine the relationships between rates of dung removal and dung beetle abundance and richness. Regressions of abundance and richness with average percent dung removal were positive and significant, demonstrating the potential of the method as a non-lethal proxy. While the dung removal method cannot determine the species responsible, percentage dung removal was more time-efficient, costing 4 min per sample, while abundance and richness cost 13 and 17 min, respectively. Despite variability among replicates of the same habitat type, the trajectory across the restoration gradient showed an increase from sites recently revegetated toward those with mature woody vegetation. We interpreted these results as a positive response of dung beetle activity and an indication of recovery of this ecosystem service. We argue that responses that can be collected efficiently such as dung removal should be used if restorationists have limited resources for data collection and analysis; non-specialists are involved; knowledge of ecosystem function is required, and animal ethics constrain options.
2055244614	Pepper (Capsicum annuum L.) is one of the most important crops in the family Solanaceae. However, the number of polymorphic molecular loci detected in this important crop is far behind that of other cultivated plant species. In the present study, a total of 45 microsatellite primer pairs were developed using Capsicum expressed sequence tags databases. Microsatellite primer pairs were tested using several species of Capsicum and several genera in the family Solanaceae including tomato, potato, eggplant, and tobacco. Results indicated that microsatellite primer pairs amplified genomic targets of C. annuum L., Capsicum baccatum L., Capsicum chacoense L., Capsicum chinense L., Capsicum frutescens L., and Capsicum pubescens Ruiz et Pavon, indicating species transferability within Capsicum. Further analyses revealed that amplicons of these primer pairs segregated 1:2:1 or 3:1 Mendelian fashions in 38 F2 individuals of pepper. It was also noted that markers derived from sequences containing dinucleotide repeats were generally more polymorphic at the intraspecific level than sequences containing trinucleotide repeats. All the microsatellite primer pairs developed in this study will be useful for marker-assisted selection and mapping studies in pepper.
2055244650	Abstract The formation of an olfactory recognition memory by female mice for the stud male pheromones requires two fundamental conditions: incidence of mating and retention of the stud male with the female for a critical 6 h interval following mating. This biologically critical recognition memory results from plasticity of reciprocal dendrodendritic synapses in the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB). In this study, a microglia marker antibody (ionized calcium-binding adaptor protein, Iba1) was used to determine how mating and stud pheromones affect microglia in the AOB rostrocaudal axis in female mice. The results showed that compared with estrus and mating only, mating and pheromone exposure significantly increased Iba1 immunoreactivity in the AOB evidenced by increased complexity of ramified microglial processes characteristic of resting microglial morphological phenotype, particularly in the rostral AOB. The density of Iba1 staining after mating and stud pheromone exposure was higher in the rostral – compared to caudal – AOB and was most prevalent in the external plexiform layer, the site of reciprocal mitral-granule dendrodendritic synapses. While cells with activated phenotype were observed in caudal AOB during estrus, mating/pheromone exposure appeared to induce a morphological transformation to the resting microglia phenotype. Since previous evidence implicate the rostral AOB in processing pheromonal signals and microglial cells monitor active synapses, these observations have important functional implications for a potential role for microglia in processing pheromonal signals in the AOB during the formation of olfactory memory.
2055244688	Application of molecular techniques to study the genetics and gene expression alterations in non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHLs) has revealed examples of common genetic events shared across individual disease types as well as extensive heterogeneity within specific diseases. For example, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) can be effectively divided into two broad molecular subgroups in which genetic changes unique to each subgroup continue to be further determined. The broad availability of next-generation sequencing (NGS) now affords the ability to fully characterize the genetics of individual tumor types and application of this to some common NHLs has provided a wealth of new information. NGS-based research in NHL has unraveled a complex set of genetic alterations that underlie each of the DLBCL molecular subgroups. For example, these and studies of other NHLs have indicated a variety of mechanisms by which nuclear factor- κB (NF-κB) is deregulated in mature B-cell neoplasms and have also found extensive common features between germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL and other germinal center–derived lymphomas. Overall, NGS has identified new players in each of the studied diseases and provided promising new therapeutic targets for NHL.
2055244762	There are two main modalities of communication between neurons, known as electrical and chemical synaptic transmission. Despite striking differences in their underlying mechanisms, new evidence suggests that the formation of electrically and chemically mediated synapses is under common regulatory processes.
3149571457	Toxin-binding protein is one of the key subjects in plant pathogenic mycotoxin research. In this paper, new advances in toxin-binding proteins of 10 kinds of plant pathogenic mycotoxins belonging to Helminthosporium ,Alternaria ,Fusicoccum ,Verticillium were reviewed, especially the techniques and methods of toxin-binding proteins of HS-toxin, HV-toxin, HMT-toxin, HC-toxin. It was proposed that the isotope-labeling technique and immunological chemistry technique should be combined together in research of toxin-binding protein, which will be significant to study the molecular recognition mechanism between host and pathogenic fungus.

3149571638	Attributing biological explanation to observed ecogeographical patterns requires intra-specific studies. Body size variation in latitude/altitude gradient and sexual size dimorphism variation reflect adaptation of the organisms to the varying environment and future climate impact. Investigations took place at Barguzinsky Ridge (North-East part of Baikal Lake, N 54° 20’; E 109° 30’, Russia). Beetles of the Ground Beetle Carabus odoratus Shil. were sampled in a 30 -km transect, divided into four plots – the coast, low-, middle- and high mountains (455-460, 500-720, 721-1300, 1301-1700 m above sea-level, respectively). In total 968 individuals were measured by six traits – the length and the width of elytra, pronotum and head. Our results showed that altitude and sex but not their interaction affected body size in C. odoratus. The values of all morphometric characters decreased towards the highlands in females and males. Sexual size dimorphism (SSD) varied in different traits: the highest values of SSD were recorded for the elytra length and the pronotum width (at all altitudes), and the head length (at the coastal and high mountains populations). For the other traits values of SSD at different altitudes did not differ significantly. The mean values of SSD for all the traits were similar at the coastal, low- and high mountains populations but in the middle mountains populations SSD was significantly lower.

2398634677	A well-functioning immune system is required for proper protection from infections and diseases. Vertebrates have coevolved a comprehensive immune network with the numerous microbes colonizing every surface of their body, particularly in the digestive tract. As such, the immune system has to be trained to discriminate pathogens from symbiotic microbes as well as self from nonself. Commensal microbiota in the gut plays a critical role in this development. Investigations have found correlations of gut microbiota with the development and maturation of a number of components of innate and adaptive immunity. Disruption of this microbiota-host dialog may lead to immune disorders such as allergy and immune-mediated inflammatory diseases.
2398634798	Acroceras Stapf (1920: 621) is a cosmopolitan grass genus with about 20 species (Zuloaga et al . 1988). Five of them are known to America, of which four are native according to Zuloaga & Morrone (2003): A. chaseae Zuloaga & Morrone (1988: 198), A. excavatum (Henrard 1926: 179) Zuloaga & Morrone (1988: 195), A. fluminense (Hackel 1901: 457) Zuloaga & Morrone (1988: 197), and A. zizanioides (Kunth 1816: 82) Dandy (1931: 54). The other species, A. macrum Stapf (1920: 624), is an African representative, introduced in Guyana and Suriname (Zuloaga & Morrone 2003).
2398634881	Enhanced anxiety is a salient feature of a number of psychiatric disorders including anxiety disorders, trauma-related disorders and depression. Although aberrant expression of various genes has been detected in patients suffering from persistent high anxiety as well as in high anxiety rodent models, the molecular mechanisms responsible for altered transcription regulation have been poorly addressed. Transcription regulation intimately involves the contribution of chromatin modifying processes, such as histone modification and ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling, yet their role in pathological anxiety is not known. Here, we investigated for the first time if altered levels of several ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors (ChRFs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs) may be linked to high trait anxiety in mice. While we found protein levels of the ChRFs SNF2H, ATRX, CHD1, CHD3 and CHD5 and of HDACs 1-3 and 6 to be similar in most of the tested brain areas of mice with high (HAB) versus normal (NAB) anxiety-related behavior, we observed distinctly altered regulation of SNF2H in the amygdala, and of CHD3 and CHD5 in the ventral hippocampus. In particular, CHD3 and CHD5 exhibited altered expression of protein but not of mRNA in HAB mice. Since both proteins are components of NuRD-like complexes, these results may indicate an impaired equilibrium between different NuRD-like complexes in the ventral hippocampus. Overall, our data provide novel evidence for localized differences of specific ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors in mice with high trait anxiety that may ultimately contribute to altered transcriptional programs resulting in the manifestation of pathological anxiety.
2943215255	Ocean acidification poses a significant threat to calcifying invertebrates by negatively influencing shell deposition and growth. An organism's performance under ocean acidification is not determined by the susceptibility of one single life-history stage, nor is it solely controlled by the direct physical consequences of ocean acidification. Shell development by one life-history stage is sometimes a function of the pH or pCO2 levels experienced during earlier developmental stages. Furthermore, environmental factors such as access to nutrition can buffer organismal responses of calcifying invertebrates to ocean acidification, or they can function as a co-occurring stressor when access is low. We reared larvae and juveniles of the planktotrophic marine gastropod Crepidula fornicata through combined treatments of nutritional stress and low pH, and we monitored how multiple stressors endured during the larval stage affected juvenile performance. Shell growth responded non-linearly to decreasing pH, significantly declining between pH 7.6 and pH 7.5 in larvae and juveniles. Larval rearing at pH 7.5 reduced juvenile growth as a carryover effect. Larval rearing at pH 7.6 reduced subsequent juvenile growth despite the absence of a negative impact on larval growth, demonstrating a latent effect. Low larval pH magnified the impact of larval nutritional stress on competence for metamorphosis and increased carryover effects of larval nutrition on juvenile growth. Trans-life-cycle effects of larval nutrition were thus modulated by larval exposure to ocean acidification.
2055244789	It is standard clinical practice to use a combination of two or more antimicrobial agents to treat an infection caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibiotic combinations are usually selected empirically with methods to determine the antimicrobial effect of the combination such as the time-kill assay rarely used as they are time-consuming and labour intensive to perform. Here, we report a modified time-kill assay, based on the reduction of the tetrazolium salt, 2,3-bis[2-methyloxy-4-nitro-5-sulfophenyl]-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide (XTT), that allows simple, inexpensive and more rapid determination of the in vitro activity of antibiotic combinations against P. aeruginosa. The assay was used to determine the in vitro activity of ceftazidime and tobramycin in combination against P. aeruginosa isolates from cystic fibrosis patients and the results obtained compared with those from conventional viable count time-kill assays. There was good agreement in interpretation of results obtained by the XTT and conventional viable count assays, with similar growth curves apparent and the most effective concentration combinations determined by both methods identical for all isolates tested. The XTT assay clearly indicated whether an antibiotic combination had a synergistic, indifferent or antagonistic effect and could, therefore, provide a useful method for rapidly determining the activity of a large number of antibiotic combinations against clinical isolates.
2055244792	Previously we have shown that the 3' untranslated regions (UTRs) of the replacement histone genes H3.3.A and H3.3B of Drosophila melanogaster differ in their nucleotide sequences and have different polyadenylation sites. To understand their functional relevance, which might explain the presence and evolutionary conservation of 2 different H3.3 genes, green flourescent protein (GFP) constructs with different 3' UTR sections were studied by the expression of GFP as a marker protein. Here we show that the polyadenylation signals modify the cell-specific translation of the histone replacement variants in testes and ovaries. The H3.3A gene may be required to provide postmeiotic histone H3.3 in the male germ line in transition to chromatin packaging in sperm.
2055244807	Abstract Serotonin is a neuromodulator that mediates a wide range of effects by interacting with multiple receptors. Using a strategy based on nucleotide sequence homology between genes encoding receptors that interact with guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, we have isolated a mouse gene encoding an additional serotonin receptor. When expressed in cultured cells, it displayed the pharmacological profile and coupling with adenylate cyclase characteristic of the 5HT1B receptor subtype. In NIH 3T3 cells expressing this receptor, serotonin induced a decrease in forskolin-stimulated cAMP levels. This effect was blocked by pertussis toxin, indicating that the 5HT1B receptor interacts with a pertussis toxin-sensitive guanine nucleotide-binding protein. To obtain clues as to the possible function of the 5HT1B receptor, we have analyzed its pattern of expression in the adult mouse brain by in situ hybridization. Our results, together with previous autoradiographic studies, suggest that the 5HT1B receptors are localized presynaptically on the terminals of striatal neurons and Purkinje cells and that they might modulate the release of neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid. The predominant expression of the 5HT1B receptor in the striatum and cerebellum points to an involvement of this receptor in motor control.
2055244842	N-WASP is a key regulator of cell migration and actin polymerisation. We examined the correlation of N-WASP, with human breast cancer, in vitro, in vivo and in clinical breast cancer tissue. Immunohistochemical study of frozen sectioned human breast mammary tissues (n = 124) revealed that mammary epithelial cells stained positively for N-WASP and that cancer cells in tumour tissues stained very weakly. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed that breast cancer tissues had significantly lower levels of N-WASP compared with normal background mammary tissues (0.83 ± 0.3 vs 13.6 ± 13, P = 0.03). Although no significantly correlation was found with tumour grade and TNM staging, lower levels of transcript were seen to correlate with clinical outcome following a ten year follow up. Thus tumours from patients with predicted poor prognosis had significantly lower levels than from those with good prognosis (0.098 ± 0.14 vs 1.14 ± 0.56, P = 0.05). Patients with metastatic disease/died of breast cancer had significantly lower levels of N-WASP compared to those remaining disease free (0.04 ± 0.02 and 0.47 ± 0.3, vs 0.79 ± 0.44, P = 0.01 and P < 0.05 respectively). During in vitro experiments, MDA-MB-231 cells stably transfected with N-WASP (MDA-MB-231WASP+) exhibited a significantly reduced in vitro invasiveness and motility compared with control and wild type cells (P < 0.0001), had increased adhesiveness (P = 0.05) and moreover MDA-MB-231WASP+ exhibited reduced in vivo growth (P = 0.002). The motogen HGF (50 ng/ml) caused a relocation of N-WASP to the cell periphery in a temporal and spatial response. It is concluded that N-WASP, a member of the N-WASP family may act as a tumour progression suppressor in human breast cancer and may thereforee have significant clinical value in this condition.
2055244851	Farm mink (Mustela vison) have been selected on the basis of their behaviour towards man since 1988 at the Danish Institute of Agricultural Sciences and in this study were offered the possibility to mate 1 week earlier than usual. The objective was to investigate if the behaviour-related selection has affected the reproduction of the farm mink, measured as mating willingness and reproductive success. The animals belonged to three breeding groups: A: selected for curious/confident reactions (17 males, 73 females), B: selected for timid reactions (17 males, 74 females), and C: selected without any demands on reactions towards humans (18 males, 73 females). The time when an average of 50% of the population were mated was 3-6 days for group A; thus the confident were mated 1·7 to 2·1 days earlier than the timid (B) and the control (C) animals. The length of gestation was shorter in group A (46·0 (s.d. 3·0) days) than in group C (47·6 (s.d. 3·6) days) but not different from group B (47·0 (s.d. 3·2) days). Group C had a lower kit mortality from birth to day 50 (11·3%) than groups A and B (20·4 to 21·2%). No significant differences were found between the groups regarding the frequency of successful matings, the ratio of remated females, number of interrupted matings, barren females or litter size. It is concluded that 8 years of selection has led to the development of reproductive differences primarily in the time of mating readiness, whereas the differences seen in kit loss may be related more to random effects.
2055244862	Food preference and fish-attractive parameters were studied on 1000 15- to 18-month-old Nile crocodiles, using two-choice preference tests. All three experimental groups preferred live fish over dead fish and live chicks, while ground meat was the last choice. As for fish attractiveness, motion, freshness, size, color and species were found as important parameters in the food-preference mechanism. When new feeds were presented to naive, ground-meat-eating crocodiles, we could find out the nature of innate and learned food recognition. Live fish, frogs and tadpoles were identified immediately as food, and the recognition of dead fish, chicks and anagmas required learning.
2055244899	Astrocytes, a subtype of glial cells, have numerous characteristics that were previously considered exclusive for neurons. One of these characteristics is a cytosolic [Ca2+] oscillation that controls the release of the chemical transmitter glutamate and atrial natriuretic peptide. These chemical messengers appear to be released from astrocytes via Ca(2+)-dependent exocytosis. In the present study, patch-clamp membrane capacitance measurements were used to monitor changes in the membrane area of a single astrocyte, while the photolysis of caged calcium compounds by a UV flash was used to elicit steps in [Ca2+]i to determine the exocytotic properties of astrocytes. Experiments show that astrocytes exhibit Ca(2+)-dependent increases in membrane capacitance, with an apparent Kd value of approximately 20 microM [Ca2+]i. The delay between the flash delivery and the peak rate in membrane capacitance increase is in the range of tens to hundreds of milliseconds. The pretreatment of astrocytes by the tetanus neurotoxin, which specifically cleaves the neuronal/neuroendocrine type of SNARE protein synaptobrevin, abolished flash-induced membrane capacitance increases, suggesting that Ca(2+)-dependent membrane capacitance changes involve tetanus neurotoxin-sensitive SNARE-mediated vesicular exocytosis. Immunocytochemical experiments show distinct populations of vesicles containing glutamate and atrial natriuretic peptide in astrocytes. We conclude that the recorded Ca(2+)-dependent changes in membrane capacitance represent regulated exocytosis from multiple types of vesicles, about 100 times slower than the exocytotic response in neurons.
2055244911	Assessing patterns of species distribution and abundance is important to understand the driving processes of, and predict future changes in, biodiversity. To this date, ecological studies have been mainly designed to investigate the effects of the mean magnitude of predictor variables, although ecological factors naturally vary in space and time. In a nine month long field experiment, we tested the effects of different temporal patterns (regular, lowly and highly irregular) in biomass removal (=disturbance event) on the diversity, species composition, and biomass accrual of macrobenthic assemblages grown on 15 × 15 cm2 PVC-panels. For each pattern of disturbance, disturbance events were timed at three sequences to control for possible confounding effects with recruitment patterns. Disturbance intensity was kept identical among treatments. Assemblages developed in the absence of disturbance for 3 months prior to a 150-day manipulation period, during which the biomass from 20% of the panel area was removed at each of ten disturbance events. Additional undisturbed settlement panels were deployed in the field to assess monthly recruitment rates and species succession over a one year period. Disturbance (i) reduced biomass and total species cover, (ii) changed species composition during the first half of the manipulation period significantly, and (iii) was without effect on species richness and evenness. Irregular disturbance regimes enhanced the abundance of the ascidian Ciona intestinalis, biomass accrual, and total species cover of assemblages relative to the regular disturbance regime, but had either no or only transient effects on diversity and species composition, respectively. Neither the degree of irregularity in disturbance nor the sequence of disturbance events affected any of the response variables significantly. Recruitment of species was strongly seasonal with almost only diatoms recruiting during winter, while recruitment was most intense during summer. Our results suggest that the temporal patterns of predictor variables might be of low explanatory power for the variance of responses in communities with seasonal recruitment patterns that are exposed to a high level of disturbance. Thus the need to include temporal patterns of predictor variables in experimental designs may depend on community dynamics and the characteristics of the process under investigation.
2055244935	Plant small-molecule UDP-glycosyltransferases (UGT) glycosylate a vast number of endogenous substances but also act in detoxification of metabolites produced by plant-pathogenic microorganisms. The ability to inactivate the Fusarium graminearum mycotoxin deoxynivalenol (DON) into DON-3-O-glucoside is crucial for resistance of cereals. We analyzed the UGT gene family of the monocot model species Brachypodium distachyon and functionally characterized two gene clusters containing putative orthologs of previously identified DON-detoxification genes from Arabidopsis thaliana and barley. Analysis of transcription showed that UGT encoded in both clusters are highly inducible by DON and expressed at much higher levels upon infection with a wild-type DON-producing F. graminearum strain compared with infection with a mutant deficient in DON production. Expression of these genes in a toxin-sensitive strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae revealed that only two B. distachyon UGT encoded by members of a cluster of six genes homologous to the DON-inactivating barley HvUGT13248 were able to convert DON into DON-3-O-glucoside. Also, a single copy gene from Sorghum bicolor orthologous to this cluster and one of three putative orthologs of rice exhibit this ability. Seemingly, the UGT genes undergo rapid evolution and changes in copy number, making it difficult to identify orthologs with conserved substrate specificity.
2055245035	The compound 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a by-product of human industrial activity, was found to affect ovarian steroidogenesis in ani- mals, but the mechanism of its action is still unclear. The aims of the study were to examine the effect of TCDD on (1) progesterone (P4) and oestradiol (E2) pro- duction by granulosa cells isolated from medium (3-6 mm) and preovulatory (≥ 8 mm) porcine follicles, (2) the viability of the cells, and (3) the incidence of apoptosis. Porcine granulosa cells were cultured (48 h) with or without TCDD (100 pM, 100 nM). Steroid hormone concentrations in the medium were deter- mined by radioimmunoassay. The viability of granulosa cells was tested spectro- photometrically (alamarBlue™ assay). Apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytome- try using Annexin V and by TUNEL assay. The higher dose of TCDD (100 nM) significantly inhibited P4 and stimulated E2 production by luteinised granulosa cells isolated from medium follicles. The lower dose of TCDD (100 pM) signifi- cantly stimulated P4 and inhibited E2 secretion by the cells isolated from preovula- tory follicles. None of the two TCDD doses affected cell viability or induced apoptosis in granulosa cells. In conclusion, TCDD directly affected steroid pro- duction by granulosa cells obtained from mature pigs, but the effect of TCDD was not due to its cytotoxicity.
2055245060	A novel tumor-associated peptide epitope KASIFLK expressed preferentially by breast cancer cells was identified using an IgG antibody from a breast cancer patient. A cDNA library from a MCF-7 breast cancer cell line was screened to isolate three cDNA clones that were immunoreactive with this antibody. KASIFLK was located in clones 27 and 40, both of which were identical to the cDNA and protein sequence of retinoblastoma binding protein 1 (RBP1, 250-256). An affinity-purified IgG antibody against the peptide epitope was completely absorbed by cytoplasmic extracts of MCF-7 cells. Immunohistochemical staining using this antibody revealed the antigen in MCF-7 cells and in 12 of 15 primary breast cancer tissues and 3 of 34 other cancer tissues, but in none of 6 normal breast tissues. Anti-KASIFLK antibody titers were significantly higher in sera of 55 breast cancer patients than in sera from 30 normal healthy donors (P>0.001). These results suggest that KASIFLK or its cross-reactive epitope is a breast cancer antigen and is immunogenic in humans.
2055245068	"Phylogenomic analysis of the occurrence and abundance of protein domains in proteomes has recently showed that the α/β architecture is probably the oldest fold design. This holds important implications for the origins of biochemistry. Here we explore structure-function relationships addressing the use of chemical mechanisms by ancestral enzymes. We test the hypothesis that the oldest folds used the most mechanisms. We start by tracing biocatalytic mechanisms operating in metabolic enzymes along a phylogenetic timeline of the first appearance of homologous superfamilies of protein domain structures from CATH. A total of 335 enzyme reactions were retrieved from MACiE and were mapped over fold age. We define a mechanistic step type as one of the 51 mechanistic annotations given in MACiE, and each step of each of the 335 mechanisms was described using one or more of these annotations. We find that the first two folds, the P-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolase and the NAD(P)-binding Rossmann-like homologous superfamilies, were α/β architectures responsible for introducing 35% (18/51) of the known mechanistic step types. We find that these two oldest structures in the phylogenomic analysis of protein domains introduced many mechanistic step types that were later combinatorially spread in catalytic history. The most common mechanistic step types included fundamental building blocks of enzyme chemistry: ""Proton transfer,"" ""Bimolecular nucleophilic addition,"" ""Bimolecular nucleophilic substitution,"" and ""Unimolecular elimination by the conjugate base."" They were associated with the most ancestral fold structure typical of P-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolases. Over half of the mechanistic step types were introduced in the evolutionary timeline before the appearance of structures specific to diversified organisms, during a period of architectural diversification. The other half unfolded gradually after organismal diversification and during a period that spanned ∼2 billion years of evolutionary history."
2055245217	Retrieval by different mesh-sized plankton nets is compared, using the abundance and distribution patterns of cyclopoid copepods of the genus Oithona W. Baird, 1843 as a case study. Mesozooplankton was sampled during spring, summer, and autumn of 2000-2002 in the South China Sea. Plankton samples were collected by surface tows (5-0 m) and by oblique tows in three different depth layers (0-50 m, 0-100 m, and 0-150 m), with Norpac zooplankton nets of 333 and 100 mu m mesh size. The oithonid density and diversity in the plankton samples collected through a 100 mu m mesh was about one order of magnitude higher than those collected through a 333 mu m mesh. The mean occurrence frequency of Oithona spp. in the plankton samples collected through a 100 mu m mesh net was > 85% and > 60% through a 333 mu m mesh net, with a mean total density of 45.86 +/- 206.97 m(-3) for the 100 mu m mesh net compared to 2.28 +/- 21.94 m(-3) for the 333 mu m mesh net [which indicates the enormous patchiness in occurrence of these copepods]. The density of smaller mesozooplankton, as evidenced by Oithona spp., has thus been underestimated by previous researchers using larger meshed nets. Samples collected through a 100 mu m mesh net demonstrated the numerical importance of the genus Oithona and its distinct seasonal and interannual patterns of abundance and distribution in the South China Sea.
2055245236	A partial cranium of a juvenile Australopithecus boisei, recovered from the Shungura Formation in the lower Omo basin, southern Ethiopia, and dated at 2.1 m.y. B.P., is described anatomically and compared to young and adult australopithecines, modern Homo sapiens, chimpanzees, and gorillas. A resemblance to the gracile Australopithecus is observed but is attributed mainly to the generalized appearance of the Omo specimen resulting from its young individual age. An attempt is made to reconstruct part of the ontogenetic process of A. boisei. This process is compared to the developmental changes exhibited by the African great apes and modern man and is found to combine characteristics of both.
2055245266	"Abstract Ustilago , commonly referred to as ""corn smut,"" rarely causes human disease. Serious clinical infections caused by Ustilago species have been sparsely reported in medical literature. In this study, a case of central line infection caused by Ustilago species is presented."
2055245287	Although sequence changes in the malarial multidrug-resistance gene, Pfmdr1, such as asn86tyr, have been linked with chloroquine-resistance in a collection of routinely cultured, laboratory strains of Plasmodium falciparum, an experimental cross indicates that another gene may be involved. Mammalian cells transfected with wild-type Pfmdr1 are more susceptible to chloroquine but 3′ mutations abolish the effect by increasing the lysosomal pH, probably due to defective anion-channel activity. In malarial parasites, overexpression of wild-type Pfmdr1 leads to increased chloroquine sensitivity. Use of PCR amplification on uncultivated material from Zaria confirms that a highly significant, though incomplete, association exists between asn86tyr and resistance to chloroquine, supporting the involvement of this gene. If a Pfmdr1gene with a resistance-related mutation were overexpressed, this might have a different effect from overexpression of a wild-type gene. A functional or non-functional anion channel associated with the carboxy-terminal end of the Pfmdr1 product could lead to conflicting effects of overexpression, depending on the presence or absence of mutations associated with either end. It is possible that the additional gene involved in resistance may regulate baseline lysosomal pH, which could have a primary influence on resistance, irrespective of mutations in Pfmdr1.
2943215699	The diploid strawberry Fragaria vesca serves as an ideal model plant for cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa, 8x) and the Rosaceae family. The F. vesca genome was initially published in 2011 using older technologies. Recently, a new and greatly improved F. vesca genome, designated V4, was published. However, the number of annotated genes is remarkably reduced in V4 (28,588 genes) compared to the prior annotations (32,831 to 33,673 genes). Additionally, the annotation of V4 (v4.0.a1) implements a new nomenclature for gene IDs (FvH4_XgXXXXX), rather than the previous nomenclature (geneXXXXX). Hence, further improvement of the V4 genome annotation and assigning gene expression levels under the new gene IDs with existing transcriptome data are necessary to facilitate the utility of this high-quality F. vesca genome V4. Here, we built a new and improved annotation, v4.0.a2, for F. vesca genome V4. The new annotation has a total of 34,007 gene models with 98.1% complete Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCOs). In this v4.0.a2 annotation, gene models of 8,342 existing genes are modified, 9,029 new genes are added, and 10,176 genes possess alternatively spliced isoforms with an average of 1.90 transcripts per locus. Transcription factors/regulators and protein kinases are globally identified. Interestingly, the transcription factor family FAr-red-impaired Response 1 (FAR1) contains 82 genes in v4.0.a2 but only two members in v4.0.a1. Additionally, the expression levels of all genes in the new annotation across a total of 46 different tissues and stages are provided. Finally, miRNAs and their targets are reanalyzed and presented. Altogether, this work provides an updated genome annotation of the F. vesca V4 genome as well as a comprehensive gene expression atlas with the new gene ID nomenclature, which will greatly facilitate gene functional studies in strawberry and other evolutionarily related plant species. An updated annotation of the wild strawberry genome includes over nine thousand new genes. Since the genome sequence of the wild strawberry was first published in 2011, technological improvements have led to various refinements and updates. Chunying Kang and colleagues at Huazhong Agricultural University in Wuhan, China, found that a large number of genes were either absent or inaccurately described in the annotation of the latest wild strawberry genome. They annotated 5,419 more protein-coding genes, including 139 transcription factor and 92 protein kinase encoding genes, and carried out a comprehensive analysis of the expression patterns of all genes in the new annotation. They also identified microRNAs that contribute to regulate gene expression. These data will aid future comparative and functional studies in widely grown hybrid strawberry species.
2943215726	Sorghum and foxtail millet seeds are food source cereals with hight carbohydrates, the content of carbohydrate in 100 g the flour seeds sorghum is 86.47%. The content of carbohydrate in 100 g the flour seeds foxtail millet is 68.32%, therefore nutrients of straw mushrooms mycelium fulfilled. This reserach was conducted to determine the growth of F0 straw mushrooms in the flour seeds sorghum and foxtail millet as alternative media on a different concentrations. Type of this research is qualitative descriptive with experimental design research Complete Randomize Design (RAL) factorial pattern consisting of 6 treatments and 2 repititions. It factor was concentrations of flour seeds, 10% (K1), 15% (K2), 20% (K3) and factor was type of flour seeds sorghum (B1), and foxtail millet (B2). The result are mycelium straw mushrooms able to grow in the media flour seeds sorghum and foxtail millet. Growth mycelium fastest day to 7 on media flour seeds sorghum concentration of 15% with a diameter of the growth of 8 cm and the latest growth mycelium on media flour seeds foxtail millet concentration of 20% with a diameter of the growth of 1 cm. Density growth mycelium more conference there are in media flour seeds foxtail millet.
2943215794	Total hip arthroplasty (THA) represents one of the commonest surgical procedures in the orthopedic field. Osteointegration of the implant with native bone is essential for an optimal result; thus, the quality of the patient's bone surrounding the implant (i.e., the bone stock) is crucial. However, in some cases, the bone stock is insufficient and needs to be improved with autologous grafts rich in multipotent cells (i.e., from the iliac crest, from the head of the femur, or from the subchondral bone harvested from the acetabulum) or allogenic frozen bone. It is not known if the harvesting site may influence the osteogenic potential of these cells. Thus, our aim was to characterize and compare multipotent cells collected from the bone marrow, acetabular subchondral bone, and trabecular bone on the femoral head with a focus on osteogenic differentiation. The cells from three sources had a fibroblast-like phenotype and expressed surface antigens CD73, CD90, and CD105 and are negative to CD11b, CD34, and CD45. Although all these cells could be induced to differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, and adipocytes, they displayed different differentiation potentials. In osteogenic differentiation condition, the cells from the acetabulum had the lowest accumulation of calcium deposit while the cells originated from the bone marrow and femur created a considerably increased amount of the deposit. These findings were confirmed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). In chondrogenic and adipogenic conditions, bone marrow cells possessed a predominant differential capacity compared with the others, illustrated by high collagen type II expression together with a cartilage-like lacuna structure and the presence of fat-specific markers, respectively. To our knowledge, this is the first study comparing and demonstrating that the progenitor cells obtained from diverse surgical sites in hip replacement procedure share common characteristics of MSC but differ about plasticity and may provide rational for clinical application in cell therapy and bone grafting. The project number L1033 is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03369457.
2943216026	Each hepatocellular carcinoma displays dozens of mutations in driver and passenger genes. The analysis of the types of substitutions and their trinucleotide context defines mutational signatures that recapitulate the endogenous and exogenous mutational processes operative in tumor cells. Aristolochic acid is present in plants from the genus Aristolochia and causes chronic nephropathy. Moreover, aristolochic acid has genotoxic properties responsible for the occurrence of urothelial carcinoma. Metabolites of aristolochic acid form DNA adducts on adenine residues leading to a specific mutational signature with almost exclusively A:T to T:A transversions, preferentially in a C T G trinucleotide context. Interestingly, this mutational fingerprint has been identified in a subset of hepatocellular carcinomas suggesting that aristolochic acid is a new risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma. More data are warranted to capture the real impact of exposure to aristolochic acid in hepatocellular carcinoma occurrence worldwide.
2943216063	The increased incidence of testicular disorders in young men and the possible influence of environmental chemicals, such as dibutyl phthalate (DBP) and acrylamide (AA), requires experimental models for identifying modes of action. Most published reproductive toxicologic studies use RNA samples from the total testis to evaluate testicular gene expression; however, analyses of isolated cell types could provide a more specific tool. Among testicular germ cells, spermatogonia are critical since they represent the onset of spermatogenesis. This study aimed, (1) to establish a technique for spermatogonia isolation; (2) to apply this isolation technique to verify possible gene expression alterations (Pou5f1, Kitlg, Mki-67, Bak1 and Spry4) in prepubertal post-natal day, (PND24) and pubertal (PND45) testes after in utero and postnatal exposure to DBP or AA. The technique was efficient for isolation of a majority of spermatogonia. In utero DBP exposure led to reduced litter body weight at birth, reduced anogenital distance of male pups on PND4, and increased frequency of male nipple retention on PND14 compared to controls. DBP-exposed relative testes weights were reduced only at PND24 compared to control but they did not differ at PND45. DBP-exposed animals showed reduced expression levels of Pou5f1 and Mki67 on PND24, and reduced expression of Pou5f1 and Spry4 on PND45. AA exposure reduced expression of Pou5f1, Mki67, and Spry4 at PND45 although not significantly. Our results suggest that DBP acts by reducing cell proliferation and impairing differentiation in prepubertal and pubertal testes.
2398635558	Sambiloto leaf (Andrographis paniculata) extract is a herbal medicine that used to be an imunostimulator when the body is getting ill and decline in body function. The purpose of this research is to prove that therapy of sambiloto leaf (Andrographis paniculata) extract as imunostimulator can increase the proliferation of lymphocyte blood cells in mice with Salmonella typhimurium infection. Twenty five mice were divided into five experimental groups on the therapy of sambiloto leaf (Andrographis paniculata) extract for 6 days, and twenty five mice others on the therapy of sambiloto leaf (Andrographis paniculata) extract for 13 days. All groups, except K(-), infected with ½ ml of 105 cells/ml Salmonella typhimurium intraperitoneally. After five days incubation period, mice were given extract of sambiloto leaf(Andrographis paniculata) in different doses, which were P1 with 4.42 mg/25g BW/day, P2 with 6.82 mg/25g BW/day, P3 with 9.25 mg/25g BW/day, while P0 is an experimental group which not given on therapy of sambiloto leaf (Andrographis paniculata) extract. The data of this study was analyzed with ANOVA according to the completely randomized factorial sampling design, if F value is higher than Ftable continued by Tukey HSD test (Honestly Significant Difference). The result of this research showed that there were no significant differences (p>0.05) between treatment groups in increasing number of absolute lymphocyte cells in the blood of mice with Salmonella typhimurium infection.
2398635598	Several species belonging to the Hyptis (Lamiaceae) genus represent an important source of bioactive constituents, which are reputed for their wide range of antimicrobial, anticancer and insecticidal activities. The volatile oils obtained from various parts of the Hyptis plants were found to be primarily composed of mono- and sesquiterpenes. Significant differences were observed in the percentage compositions of the major components, which allowed for differentiation among the species. Based on the dominant constituents, phylogenetic relationships were found to be common among some species: 1,8-cineole (H. fruticosa, H. goyazensis, H. martiusii and H. suaveolens); beta-caryophyllene (H. marrubioides, H. pectinata, H. spicigera and H. suaveolens); eugenol (H. recurvata and H. suaveolens); gamma-cadinene (H. glomerata and H. ovalifolia); p-cymene (H. mutabilis and H. pectinata); alpha-pinene (H. crenata and H. emoryi). The monoterpenes, alpha-pinene and p-cymene were detected at various concentrations in all the Hyptis oils investigated. This paper reviews the essential oil compositions of eighteen Hyptis plant species studied in various parts of the world covering the publications of 100 years (1909 to 2009) after the first article appeared in the literature.
2398635825	This study was undertaken to determine if Brazilian Pemphigus foliaceus (BPF) autoantibodies will fix complement as do P. vulgaris (PV) autoantibodies. When sections of human skin were examined following indirect immunofluorescence (IF) staining, BPF autoantibodies reacted with the upper layers of epidermis, while PV autoantibodies were reactive with the lower layers. When tissue culture epidermal cells were used for indirect IF, BPF autoantibodies were not detected after plating until 24 h, while PV autoantibodies reacted within 18 h of plating. Using complement IF staining methods, BPF autoantibodies were found to fix C1q, C4 and C3 to whole skin sections in an intercellular pattern and to the surface of cultured keratinocytes. Although reactive with different epidermal cell surface antigens, autoantibodies in BPF will fix complement in a fashion similar to autoantibodies in PV.
2398635902	O-glycosylated glycoproteins are the main constituents of gastric mucus. They are responsible for its viscosity and for its gel-forming properties. Recent advances accomplished over the last years on its physical and chemical characterization are briefly reviewed. Many issues remain still unsettled concerning the modification of its structure and composition in diseases as well as details of its biosynthesis and its pharmacology.
2398635931	To make the genetic profile of the LIBP/1 inbred strain obtained from Kunming mice, the most widely used outbred stock in China, 26 loci were examined. The genotypes of four kinds of coat color genes were a/a, B/B, c/c and D/D. The results of testing 21 biochemical marker genes showed Akp-1b, Amy-1a, Car-2a, Ce-2a, Es-1b, Es-3a, Es-10a, Es-11a, Gpd-1a, Gpi-1a, Gus-1b, Hbbs, Idh-1a, Ldr-1a, Mod-1a, Mup-1b, Pep-3b, Pgm-a, Sep-1b, Tam-1c, and Trfb. The H-2 gene loci were Kb and Db.
2398635945	We have examined the effects of starvation, normal lab chow and low-fat carbohydrate-rich diet on rat fatty acid synthase (FAS, EC 2.3.1.85). Under each of the dietary conditions the amount of FAS mRNA is different, the most being produced after a low-fat carbohydrate-rich diet. There is also an increase in the amount of FAS protein under the same conditions. To complete the picture we determined the incorporation of [14C]acetate into palmitate as a measure of enzyme activity. Data for cardiac and renal tissue also reflect a dietary influence on FAS. Therefore FAS mRNA, FAS protein and FAS activity are all responsive to dietary-induced signals, and our results suggest a pre-translational regulation.
3149571968	AIM: To investigate the point mutation at codon 54 of mannose binding lectin (MBL) gene, detect the plasma MBL level, and analyze the correlation between the gene mutation frequency and plasma MBL concentration. METHODS: A method for detecting MBL gene point mutation (PCR RFLP) was established with self-designed primers according to MBL genomic sequence. The plasma MBL concentration was detected by MBL Oliger ELISA kit. RESULTS: The PCR RFLP for detecting the point mutation at codon 54 of MBL gene was established. Frequency of point mutation at codon 54 of MBL gene in healthy Mongolians was 0.18. The plasma MBL concentration was (2.53±1.96)mg/L. There was negative correlation between plasma MBL concentration and MBL gene mutation frequency in Mongolians ( r = -0.641) . CONCLUSION: The established method of PCR RFLP was proved to have high specificity, excellent reproducibility and high sensitivity. The relationship between frequency of mutation at codon 54 of MBL gene and the plasma MBL concentration in healthy Mongolians is negatively correlated.

2055245602	We performed a genome-wide association study of non-Hispanic, white individuals with fibrotic idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs; n = 1,616) and controls (n = 4,683), with follow-up replication analyses in 876 cases and 1,890 controls. We confirmed association with TERT at 5p15, MUC5B at 11p15 and the 3q26 region near TERC, and we identified seven newly associated loci (Pmeta = 2.4 × 10(-8) to 1.1 × 10(-19)), including FAM13A (4q22), DSP (6p24), OBFC1 (10q24), ATP11A (13q34), DPP9 (19p13) and chromosomal regions 7q22 and 15q14-15. Our results suggest that genes involved in host defense, cell-cell adhesion and DNA repair contribute to risk of fibrotic IIPs.
2055245611	The C-type lectins DC-SIGN (CD209) and L-SIGN (CD299) recognize defined carbohydrates expressed on pathogens and cells. Those lectins are expressed on dendritic cells (DC) and/or on liver-sinusoidal endothelial cells. Both cell types modulate immune responses. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), aberrant glycosylation of blast cells can alter their interaction with the C-type lectins DC-SIGN and L-SIGN, thereby affecting their immunological elimination. We investigated whether recombinant DC-SIGN and L-SIGN bind to blood or bone marrow cells from B- and T-ALL patients and compared that with binding of peripheral blood lymphocytes from healthy donors. It was found that increased binding of ALL cells to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN was observed compared to cells from healthy donors. Furthermore, L-SIGN bound a higher percentage of leukemic and normal cells than DC-SIGN. B-ALL bone marrow cells showed the highest binding to L-SIGN. DC-SIGN bound equally well to B-ALL and T-ALL cells. Within ALL subtypes, DC-SIGN binding was higher with mature T-ALL. Interestingly, our data demonstrate that increased binding of DC-SIGN and L-SIGN to peripheral leukemic cells from B-ALL patients is associated with poor survival. These data demonstrate that high binding of B-ALL peripheral blood cells to DC-SIGN and L-SIGN correlates with poor prognosis. Apparently, when B-ALL cells enter the blood circulation and are able to interact with DC-SIGN and L-SIGN the immune response is shifted toward tolerance. Additional studies are necessary to ascertain the possible role of these results in terms of disease pathogenesis and their potential as target to eradicate leukemic cells.
2055245614	Abstract The launch of a new research network in Europe bolsters the continent's commitment to epigenetic research which kicked off last year. Nigel Williams reports.
2055245741	A novel method that allows direct analysis of single base mutation by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is described. The method utilizes the finding that PNAs (peptide nucleic acids) recognize and bind to their complementary nucleic acid sequences with higher thermal stability and specificity than the corresponding deoxyribooligonucleotides and that they cannot function as primers for DNA polymerases. We show that a PNA/DNA complex can effectively block the formation of a PCR product when the PNA is targeted against one of the PCR primer sites. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this blockage allows selective amplification/suppression of target sequences that differ by only one base pair. Finally we show that PNAs can be designed in such a way that blockage can be accomplished when the PNA target sequence is located between the PCR primers.
2055245749	The effect of nine ionic and nine non-ionic detergents, over a 0.3–3.0% (w/v) concentration range, on the activity of the enzymes which convert [2-14C]mevalonic acid into phytoene (7,8,11,12,7′,8′,11′,12′-ψ,ψ-carotene) and β-carotene (β,β-carotene) has been investigated with cell extracts of the C115 carS42 mad-107(−) (β-carotene-accumulating) strain of Phycomyces blakesleeanus. The enzymes catalyzing the conversion of mevalonic acid into phytoene in the C115 and the C5 carB10(−) (phytoene-accumulating) strains of Phycomyces could be released from membranes with high molarity Tris-HCl buffer, but the other carotenogenic enzymes required solubilization with detergents. Enzymic activity was retained with only two ionic detergents (Zwittergents 3–8 and 3–10), whilst Tweens 40 and 60 were the least inhibitory of the non-ionic surfactants. Both Tween 60 and Zwittergent 3–08 solubilized almost 50% of the enzymic activities for the conversion of phytoene to β-carotene, but the former preparation was significantly more stable on storage at −70°C.
2055245771	The identity of the monoamine which produces a very weak formaldehyde-induced fluorescence in some pancreatic islet cells was studied by fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry either on the same tissue section or on serial tissue sections of tissue from male chickens. Pancreatic islet cells showing this very weak formaldehyde-induced fluorescence react immunohistochemically with antisera directed against insulin, aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and dopamine beta-hydroxylase and therefore appear to be islet B cells producing insulin and noradrenaline.
2055245827	G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) comprise a large class of transmembrane proteins that play critical roles in both normal physiology and pathophysiology. These critical roles offer targets for therapeutic intervention, as exemplified by the substantial fraction of current pharmaceutical agents that target members of this family. Tremendous contributions to our understanding of GPCR structure and dynamics have come from both indirect and direct structural characterization techniques. Key features of GPCR conformations derived from both types of characterization techniques are reviewed.
2055245856	Human leukocyte chemoattractant receptors activate chemotactic and cytotoxic pathways to varying degrees and also activate different G-proteins depending on the receptor and the cell-type. To determine the relationship between G-protein usage and the biological and biochemical responses activated, receptors for the chemoattractants formyl peptides (FR), platelet-activating factor (PAFR), and leukotriene B(4) (BLTR) were transfected into RBL-2H3 cells. Pertussis toxin (Ptx) served as a Galpha(i) inhibitor. These receptors were chosen to represent the spectrum of G(i) usage as Ptx had differential effects on their ability to induce calcium mobilization, phosphoinositide hydrolysis, and exocytosis with complete inhibition of all responses by FR, intermediate effects on BLTR, and little effect on PAFR. Ptx did not affect ligand-induced phosphorylation of PAFR and BLTR but inhibited phosphorylation of FR. In contrast, chemotaxis to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine, leukotriene B(4), and platelet-activating factor was completely blocked by Ptx. Wortmannin, a phosphotidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor, also completely blocked ligand-induced chemotaxis by all receptors but did not affect calcium mobilization or phosphoinositide hydrolysis; however, it partially blocked the exocytosis response to formylmethionylleucylphenylalanine and the platelet-activating factor. Membrane ruffling and pseudopod extension via the BLTR was also completely inhibited by both Ptx and wortmannin. These data suggest that of the chemoattractant receptors studied, G-protein usage varies with FR being totally dependent on G(i), whereas BLTR and PAFR utilize both G(i) and a Ptx-insensitive G-protein. Both Ptx-sensitive and -insensitive G-protein usage can mediate the activation of phospholipase C, mobilization of intracellular calcium, and exocytosis by chemoattractant receptors. Chemotaxis, however, had an absolute requirement for a G(i)-mediated pathway.
2055245894	Infestations of the citrus rust mitePhyllocoptruta oleivora (Ashmead), the brown citrus rust miteTegolophus australis Keifer, and the citrus red mitePanonychus citri (McGregor), did not cause economic damage to orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) in two coastal New South Wales orchards during a three-year study. The seasonal abundance of the mites and their phytoseiid and coccinellid predators was defined using periodic regressions of transformed counts on time. Population peaks coincided with seasonal rises and falls in temperature and evaporation in late-summer/autumn and in spring/early-summer. Population troughs in late-spring/summer coincided with peaks in temperature and evaporation and reproductive dormancy in some of the coccinellids. Population troughs in winter generally coincided with troughs in evaporation and temperature, particularly in July when the average temperature was about 10°C. Partial correlation coefficients were used to determine the relationships between the predators and their prey. These were mostly nonsignificant atP=0.05. Fortnightly and daily fluctuations in weather did not have any obvious effects on numbers of the mites. The effects of fungicides and pesticides applied during the study were not clear.
2943216533	The relative effect of seasonality and body size on the diet composition of juvenile Lutjanus synagris was investigated at a sheltered sandy beach (20°18’S; 40°16’W) on the coast of Espirito Santo state, Brazil. Monthly collections were carried out during the daytime from May 2004 to April 2005, using a beach seine. The specimens captured in each season (e.g. cold/dry, May to October 2004; hot/rainy, November 2004 to April 2005) were separated into three total length (TL) classes (≤ 40; 41–50; ≥ 51 mm). The stomach contents of 540 specimens with TL ranging from 22 to 135 mm were analyzed. Among the 13 food items consumed by L. synagris, the most important were Amphipoda (Index of Relative Importance, IRI = 81.2), Isopoda (IRI = 13.8) and Mysidacea (IRI = 4.4). Significant variations in the diet composition were observed between the seasons (PERMANOVA; P < 0.001), but not between the size classes (P = 0.170). There was, however, a significant interaction between these two factors (P<0.001), indicating that the differences between the seasons did not occur in every class. The most important items in the cold/dry and hot/rainy seasons were, respectively, Mysidacea and Amphipoda, for every class. The average length of the preys varied significantly (P<0.05) between the size classes, increasing progressively with the TL of the fishes. Overall, the results indicate a carnivore-opportunist food habit for L. synagris, with significant seasonal changes in the relative importance of the food items.
2943216558	The use of plants as a medicine is sometimes doubted in modern medicine because it is not considered to have sufficient evidence. Zingiber montanum or also known as bangle is a of the types in the family Zingiberaceae which is used as a medicine, but an in-depth study of secondary metabolites and their bioactivity is still limited. This article aims to reveal botany, secondary metabolites, and bioactivity Z. purpureum so that it can be used as a basis for its use and development as traditional medicine and modern medicine. Studies on articles are based on various literary sources obtained off line or online in the form of journals, books, which can be downloaded using keywords, Zingiber, Zingiber montanum, secondary metabolites and bioactivities of Z. montanum. Rhizoma Z. montamun produces flavors and can be used to replace ginger (Zingiber officinale). As a traditional medicine in Asia, Z. montanum is used as a carminative drug, a stimulant for the stomach, diarrhea, colic, and headaches. Based on the bioactivity test in vitro and in vivo Z. montanum has pharmacological effects as anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, analgesic and obesity.

2943216811	The movement towards open science is a consequence of seemingly pervasive failures to replicate previous research. This transition comes with great benefits but also significant challenges that are likely to affect those who carry out the research, usually early career researchers (ECRs). Here, we describe key benefits, including reputational gains, increased chances of publication, and a broader increase in the reliability of research. The increased chances of publication are supported by exploratory analyses indicating null findings are substantially more likely to be published via open registered reports in comparison to more conventional methods. These benefits are balanced by challenges that we have encountered and that involve increased costs in terms of flexibility, time, and issues with the current incentive structure, all of which seem to affect ECRs acutely. Although there are major obstacles to the early adoption of open science, overall open science practices should benefit both the ECR and improve the quality of research. We review 3 benefits and 3 challenges and provide suggestions from the perspective of ECRs for moving towards open science practices, which we believe scientists and institutions at all levels would do well to consider.
2943217008	Abstract. Purnamasari I, Sobir, Syukur M. 2019. Diversity and inheritance in cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) on protein and yield components characters. Biodiversitas 20: 1294-1298.  Diallel was a method that can be used to see inheritance and diversity character of plants. The objective of this study has evaluated the inheritance and diversity of the yield component characters and seed protein content. This study used genetic material from five homozygous cowpeas (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp) genotypes (KM1, KM2, KM4, KM5, and TG2) and 20 F1. Genotypes were planted using a randomized complete block design with three replications. The character observed were the yield components (weight of 100 seed, number of seeds per pod, number of pods per bunch, number of pods per plant and yield) and seeds protein content. Characters that were influenced by general combining ability (GCA) consist of weight of 100 seeds, number of pods per bunch, number of seeds per pod and seed protein content. The variance of GCA has a greater value than the variance of specific combining ability (SCA). Narrow sense and broad sense heritability values were high category consist of weight 100 seed, number seeds per pod, number pods per bunch and seed protein content. That characters were inherited additively. Characters were influenced by additive gene action and have high diversity make it possible to select in F2 generation using the pedigree selection method.
2943217138	This work aimed to evaluate the the phytoplanktonic community and the abiotic parameters during a cycle of cultivation of Litopenaeus vannamei in two stations in a pond in Curuca (PA), northern Brazil. Were measured transparency, pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity and temperature. Considering the last four parameters, were registered in the surface water and the bottom set. Additionally, also were collected samples to study the fitoplankton and chlorophyll “a” concentrations. The temperature values were between 31,5 and 35 oC; dissolved oxygen concentrations were between 4,2 and 15,5 mg/L; pH between 8,1 and 9,4; salinity from 26,9 to 30 ppm. The transparency decreased from 55 to 17 cm. The Chlorophyll a concentrations were from 2,33 to 471,34 mg/m3. The transparency decreased of 55 to 17 cm. Chlorophyll a from 2,33 to 471,34 mg/m3. Regarding the fitoplankton analyses, were identified 95 taxa and Bacillariophyta was the most representative group, with dominance of the Navicula sp, Pleurosigma sp and Nitzschia sp. The largest density registered was of 104.400 and to smallest was 3.600 org/L. The mean diversity at the station 01 was 1,49 bits/ind and in the station 02 was 1,43 bits/ind. Enter the main conclusions: the fitoplanktonic community was dominated by the diatom and the division Bacillariophyta was the most important group (wealth and density); the class dinophyceae revealed to be better adapted in the clearer waters; Chlorophyll “a” values presented a direct relationship to the feeding artificial, increasing with the time. Despite the great fluctuation of abiotic parameters such pH, dissolved oxygen and transparency, the cultivation system was considered  homogeneous. Key-words: Shrimp Farming, Litopenaeus vannamei, Microalgae.

2398636173	The protease resistant isoform of prion protein (PrP) is a diagnostic marker of spongiform encephalopathies in humans and animals. Immunoblotting is a sensitive method but requires either fresh or frozen, unfixed materials. Immunohistochemistry using formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded materials is now also considered to be sensitive and comparable to immunoblotting after various treatments, especially using the hydrolytic autoclaving method on tissue sections before staining. The advantage of this method is that it can be applied to routine pathology materials or long preserved materials. The kuru plaque-type deposition of PrP suggests abnormalities of the PrP gene, while synaptic-type deposition suggests either sporadic CJD or particular familial CJD. PrP gene abnormalities are thus related to PrP deposition and modify clinical symptoms and their progression. A PrP gene analysis can be done using either preclinical, clinical or post-mortem materials.
3149572327	Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) carrying the D614G mutation on the spike protein is the predominant circulating variant and is associated with enhanced infectivity. However, whether this dominant variant can potentially spread through the cold chain and whether the spike protein affects virus stability after cold storage remain unclear. To compare the infectivity of two SARS-CoV-2 variants, namely, SARS-CoV-2 variants with spike protein with the D614 mutation (S-D614) and G614 mutation (S-G614), after different periods of refrigeration (4°C) and freezing (-20°C). We also determined the integrity of the viral RNA and the ability of the spike protein to bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) after storage at these conditions. The results showed that SARS-CoV-2 was more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. Particularly, the S-G614 variant was found to be more stable than the S-D614 variant. The spike protein of the S-G614 variant had better binding ability with the ACE2 receptor than that of the S-D614 variant after storage at -20°C for up to 30 days. Our findings revealed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, and their stability and infectivity up to 30 days depends on the spike variant. Stability and infectivity are related to each other, and the higher stability of S-G614 compared to that of S-D614 may contribute to rapid viral spread of the S-G614 variant.IMPORTANCE It has been observed that variants of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) are more stable and infectious after storage at -20°C than at 4°C. A SARS-CoV-2 S-D614G variant is currently the most dominant variant in circulation and is associated with enhanced infectivity. We compared the stability of two SARS-CoV-2 variants: the early S-D614 variant carrying the D614 spike protein and the new S-G614 variant carrying the G614 spike protein, stored at both 4°C and -20°C for different periods. We observed that SARS-CoV-2 remains stable and infectious after refrigeration or freezing, which further depends on the spike variant, that is, the ability of the spike protein to bind with the ACE2 receptor with higher efficiency. The high stability of the S-G614 variant also explains its rapid spread and infectivity. Therefore, precautions should be taken during and after handling food preserved under cold conditions.

2943217751	Individuals of many animal species show consistent differences in ecologically relevant behaviours, and these individual-specific behaviours can correlate with each other. In passerines, aggression during nest-site defence is one of those behaviours that have been steadily found to be repeatable within individuals. Furthermore, in several cases, aggression was related to some estimates of reproductive investment. Here, we studied the possibility that behaviour of males toward a male rival predicts the amount of their future parental care. This could be beneficial to the females, because during mate choice, they could use male aggressive behaviour as a cue for parental quality. We performed the study by video recording the nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers (Ficedula albicollis) that were assayed for aggression during the courtship period. The level of aggression was not related to feeding rate in males. Feeding rate of males differed between the study years, but it did not correlate with the feeding rate of their mates, neither was it related to the morphological traits of the parents. We may conclude that nest-site defence aggression of males does not predict their parental commitment. This may be surprising given that higher testosterone levels that may be expected in aggressive males often suppress parental care. However, among-individual variance in male testosterone profiles found to be decrease from the courtship to the parenting period in flycatchers, and this may explain why differences in territorial aggression did not manifest in differences in nestling provisioning. The correlation between behaviours that are expressed in distinct periods of the annual cycle of songbirds needs further investigation. Male songbirds, when attracting mates, are often confronted with each other over nest-sites, and these male-male confrontations may be witnessed by females. If performance during territory defence predicts the quality of parental care that a male will provide for its nestlings, females could use defence behaviour as a cue for mate choice. To explore this possibility, we investigated the relationship between territorial aggression and nestling feeding activity of male collared flycatchers. We performed simulated territorial intrusions to measure the aggression of males and recorded their nestling feeding rate about a month later. We found that territorial aggression did not correlate with nestling feeding rate. This suggests that nest-site defence behaviour in the beginning of the breeding season does not carry information for females about what to expect from potential mates in terms of parental care.
2943218207	Aims of this research were to know genetic correlation of birth and weaning weight of indigenous sheep. Materials used were 240 birth and weaning weight recorded from 100 days of the indigenous lambs age that were born from 40 dams mated by 8 rams. Nested classification model was used to estimate to genetic correlation. Result of the research showed that the estimated value of genetic correlation from sire, dam, and sire-dam components were 0,32 ± 0,31; 0,52 ± 0,54, and 0,36 ± 0,52, respectively. It could be summarized that genetic correlation between birth and weaning weight of the sheep had a moderate positive. Birth weight characteristic could be used for criteria selection with non-direct selectionmethod for weaning weight.
2398636854	Microinjection experiments using cloned Xenopus laevis rDNA have resulted in a detailed analysis of transcriptional control elements of the rDNA repeat (Busby and Reeder, 1983; Labhart and Reeder, 1984; De Winter and Moss, 1986). However, to facilitate detection of X. laevis rDNA transcripts most microinjection experiments were performed in a heterologous system: X. laevis rDNA clones were injected into X. borealis oocytes. It is clear that this assay has to cope with the phenomenon of nucleolar dominance of X. laevis transcripts over X. borealis transcripts (Reeder and Roan, 1984). Another line of evidence from oocyte microinjection experiments indicated, that oocyte batches from different females are likely to contain different amounts of rDNA specific transcription factors (Trendelenburg et al., 1978; Sollner-Webb and McKnight, 1982; McStay and Reeder, 1986). From EM-observations of injected rDNA templates it is clear that transcription factors specific for RNA polymerase I compete with those for polII on individual injected templates (Trendelenburg and Gurdon, 1978; Trendelenburg and Puvion-Dutilleul, 1987). In order to allow quantitation of some essential parameters influencing rDNA transcription we used a homologous experimental system: we injected a X. laevis rDNA construct of which transcripts could be discerned from endogenous rDNA transcripts into X. laevis oocytes and monitored the amount of transcript produced by the S1 nuclease technique.
2398636871	Interleukin 37b (IL-37b) plays a key role in suppressing immune responses, partially by modulating the function of dendritic cells (DCs). However, the precise mechanisms are still largely unknown. Here, we investigated the effects of IL-37b on DC maturation and T cell responses induced by DCs, and explored the involved signaling pathways. It was found that IL-37b down-regulated the expressions of co-stimulatory molecules CD80 and CD86 on DCs in vitro. At the same time, the expressions of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α and IL-6, were suppressed, while the expression of the T cell inhibitory cytokine TGF-β was increased in IL-37b-treated DCs. In addition, the activation effect of DCs on T cells was impaired by IL-37b. We further revealed that extracellular single-regulated kinase (ERK), nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), and mTOR-S6K signaling pathways were involved in the inhibition of DCs induced by IL-37b. This was confirmed by the similarly suppressive effect of chemical inhibitors against NF-κB, ERK, and S6K on the expressions of IL-6 and TNF-α in DCs. In conclusion, these results demonstrated that IL-37b suppressed DC maturation and immunostimulatory capacity in T cell priming by involving in ERK, NF-κB, and S6K-based inhibitory signaling pathways.
2398636956	The antigens and soluble proteins ofNeurospora crassa wild-type and its conidiation deficient mutant ‘amyc’ were analyzed by immunoelectrophoresis and acrylamide gel electrophoresis respectively. Comparison of the patterns of the soluble proteins of the 2 strains, obtained with both techniques, showed an alteration of antigens and proteins in the mutant. A specific antigenic protein present in the wild-type, presumably in connection with conidiation, was also found in the mutant ‘amyc’ when it was induced to form conidia.
2398637008	S-Adenosyl-L-methionine decarboxylases were purified from rat ventral prostate, yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), slime mould (Physarum polycephalum) and bacteria (Escherichia coli) and tested for inhibition by a variety of nucleosides related to S-adenosylmethionine and by methyl- and ethyl-glyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone). Although the enzymes from these different sources are markedly different with respect to activation by cations, the inhibition by nucleosides was quite similar. Very little inhibition was seen when analogues of S-adenosylmethionine with a different base were tested or when the ribose ring was opened or the positive charge on the sulphur atom was not present. Some derivatives in which the amino acid portion of the molecule was altered were more potent inhibitors, but again there was little difference between the enzymes from different sources. 5'-(Dimethylsulphonio)-5'-deoxyadenosine and S-adenosyl-3-methylthiopropylamine were the most inhibitory substances and had similar Ki values, suggesting that the aminopropyl group does not contribute significantly to the binding. All of the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases were strongly competitively inhibited by methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) and even more powerfully by its ethyl analogue, although the putrescine-activated enzymes from prostate and yeast were more sensitive than the bacterial and slime-mould enzymes. All of the S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylases tested bound to a column of methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone) linked to Sepharose and were not eluted by 0.5 M-NaCl, but could be released by 1 mM concentrations of the drug, providing a rapid and efficient method for their purification.
2398637135	OBJECTIVE To investigate the role of integrin-linked kinase (ILK) on renal tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition and the regulatory effect of urokinase on LIK expression in mice with obstructive nephropathy. METHODS Normal male mice were randomly divided into sham-operated group (n=20), unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) group (n=28), and UUO with urokinase treatment group (uPA, n=28), and UUO was induced surgically in the latter two groups. The mice were sacrificed on days l, 3, 7 and 14 after the surgery, and renal interstitial fibrosis (RIF) was graded according to the result of Masson staining. The expression of ILK in the renal tissues of the rats was examined by immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting, and the expression of E-cadherin was detected by immunohistochemistry. RT-PCR was used to examine the mRNA expressions of ILK, E-cadherin and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA). RESULTS The expressions of ILK mRNA and protein were significantly increased in UUO group, but significantly decreased by treatment with uPA (P<0.05). The expression of alpha-SMA mRNA level was significantly increased, while E-cadherin decreased in mice with UUO on day 3 after the surgery. Treatment with uPA significantly inhibited such effects (P<0.05). CONCLUSION ILK plays an important role in renal interstitial fibrosis by mediating epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Urokinase attenuates renal tubulointerstitial fibrosis in mice with UUO possibly by inhibiting ILK expression and preventing tubular epithelial-mesenchymal transition.
2398637136	Micro- and minisatellites constitute an essential part of DNA with a low sequence complexity and carry several important functions. A search for tandem repeats in the human genome with a length of a repeat unit of up to 70 bp, including repeats with a great number of nucleotide substitutions, has been performed using the TaadeaSWAN program. It was shown that, for a considerable number of minisatellites with the length of the repeating unit of less than 25 nt, a shorter repeating motif can be distinguished in the sequence of this repeat, which often is similar to the sequence of minisatellites widely occurring in the human genome. A model of hierarchic origination of minisatellites in the human genome is suggested.

3149572959	Powdery mildew caused by Blumeria graminis f.sp.tritici(Bgt) is one of the most important diseases that damages wheat(Triticum aestivum L.) production in China.Analysis of virulence structure and effectiveness of resistance genes is important in controlling powdery mildew with host resistance.This study was conducted to test virulence structures of 41 isolates collected from Shandong and Hebei provinces in 2011.The genetic diversity of these isolates was also analyzed using SSR markers.The virulence frequencies of isolates tested ranged from 0.35(Bg40-2,Yantai,Shandong) to 0.74(Bg46-1,Pingdu,Shandong).The mean virulence frequency for the isolates from Shandong Province was not significantly different from that of the isolates from Hebei Province.Except for a few resistance genes such as Pm17,the virulence frequencies of isolates from Shandong and Hebei provinces on most resistance genes were not different.None of the isolates tested was virulent on Pm24 carried by the Chinese landrace Chiyacao.A few isolates were virulent on Pm1c,Pm16,Pm20,PmH,and Mlxbd.Two isolates from Handan and Huanghua of Hebei Province were virulent on Pm21,but none of the isolates from Shandong Province was virulent on Pm21.The virulence frequencies for Pm5e,Pm6,Pm12,Pm13,Pm17,Pm40,Pm2+6,and Pm5+6 ranged from 0.18 to 0.48.Genes Pm1a,Pm3a,Pm3c,Pm3g,Pm4a,Pm4b,Pm4c,Pm5a,Pm7,Pm8,Pm19,Pm33,Pm43,PmY39,PmPS5A,and PmDR147 had the virulence frequencies over 0.6.Analysis of genetic diversity indicated that the genetic variation of Bgt isolates occurred within the population,and gene flow occurred among isolates.Although some single spore progenies from the same location were clustered together,some were not classified into the same cluster,indicating the variation in their genetic bases.The polymorphism of virulence patterns for various resistance genes was not necessarily consistent with the DNA polymorphism as revealed by SSR markers.
2055245903	IE180, an immediate-early regulatory protein of pseudorabies virus, is required to activate viral early and late genes and is essential for viral growth. We constructed a recombinant baculovirus expressing IE180 in SF21AE insect cells. IE180 expressed by the recombinant migrated on gels as a single band with a molecular weight of 180 kDa and reacted with anti-IE180 peptide serum in Western blotting assay. Immunofluorescence using anti-IE180 peptide antibody demonstrated the accumulation of IE180 in cytoplasm of SF21AE cells infected with the recombinant virus. The IE180 produced in the insect cells was introduced into mammalian Vero cells infected with a PrV mutant with deletion of the IE180 gene by a cell-fusion technique. The growth of the deletion mutant in the fused cells was confirmed by infective assay and immunodetection of the progeny virus. This indicates that the IE180 expressed by the recombinant baculovirus is functional as a transactivator.

2055246021	The in vitro efficacy of amphotericin B and flucytosine, separately and in combination, against the hyphal growth of Candida albicans was evaluated in situ using an automatic analysing system. A colony of C. albicans was in contact with a glucose-salt medium supplemented with biotin plus calf serum (GS medium) and GS medium containing the antifungal agent, in sequence. Minimum inhibitory concentrations at single hyphal level (S-MIC) were determined based on the response that was measured. Amphotericin B S-MICs ranged from 0.8 to 0.4 microgram ml-1, and S-MIC values > 102.4 micrograms ml-1 were obtained with flucytosine when the two agents were used independently. When the two agents were used in combination, however, a synergistic interaction between the two agents at concentrations below their individual S-MICs was observed.
2055246028	Trophic effects of the neuroprotective agent selegiline on cultured dopaminergic neurons were investigated and compared with the effects produced by brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Both treatments increased the total length of TH-positive neurites, but selegiline increased the average length of neuritic branches, whereas BDNF increased the formation of new branches. This trophic effect of selegiline may contribute to its action in neurodegenerative disease treatment.
2055246083	Recent advances in high-throughput technologies have made it possible to generate both gene and protein sequence data at an unprecedented rate and scale thereby enabling entirely new “omics”-based approaches towards the analysis of complex biological processes. However, the amount and complexity of data that even a single experiment can produce seriously challenges researchers with limited bioinformatics expertise, who need to handle, analyze and interpret the data before it can be understood in a biological context. Thus, there is an unmet need for tools allowing non-bioinformatics users to interpret large data sets. We have recently developed a method, NNAlign, which is generally applicable to any biological problem where quantitative peptide data is available. This method efficiently identifies underlying sequence patterns by simultaneously aligning peptide sequences and identifying motifs associated with quantitative readouts. Here, we provide a web-based implementation of NNAlign allowing non-expert end-users to submit their data (optionally adjusting method parameters), and in return receive a trained method (including a visual representation of the identified motif) that subsequently can be used as prediction method and applied to unknown proteins/peptides. We have successfully applied this method to several different data sets including peptide microarray-derived sets containing more than 100,000 data points.   NNAlign is available online at http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/NNAlign.
2055246090	Multidrug resistance in tumor cells is often associated with the presence of an approximately 170 kDa plasma membrane glycoprotein (Pgp) that acts as a drug-efflux pump and decreases intracellular antitumor drug concentration. We measured the uptake of seven anthracyclines (daunorubicin, doxorubicin, 4'-epi-doxorubicin, 4'-deoxy-doxorubicin, iododoxorubicin, 3'-(3-methoxymorpholino)-doxorubicin (FCE23762) and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin) into K562 cells sensitive and resistant (K562/DNR) to daunorubicin. The K562/DNR subline expresses Pgp at the membrane surface, whereas its sensitive counterpart does not. Laser flow cytometry was used to quantitate intracellular anthracycline content. Uptake of daunorubicin, doxorubicin, 4'-epi-doxorubicin, and 4'-deoxy-doxorubicin was minimal in the K562/DNR subline as compared to their uptake in sensitive cells. On the contrary, iododoxorubicin, FCE23762, and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin accumulate to nearly the same extent into sensitive and resistant K562 cells. Growth inhibition data indicated that the resistance factor for iododoxorubicin, FCE23762, and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin is markedly decreased as compared to the other drugs. Fluorescence measurements were carried out to determine the kinetic parameters associated with the influx and efflux of the drugs into and out of K562 cells. Kinetic data indicated that iododoxorubicin, FCE23762, and 4-demethoxy-daunorubicin are not actively rejected from resistant cells, suggesting that they are poor substrates for Pgp-mediated transport. This observation is related to their ability to overcome the multidrug-resistant phenotype of K562/DNR cells in vitro.
2055246123	The relationships between remnant integrity and size, age, shape, environment and disturbance are not well-established. One hundred of the remnants in relatively good condition ranging in size from 5 to 200 ha in the drier parts of Tasmania were sampled and the relationships between independent variables and the dependent variables of remnant native species richness, remnant exotic species richness, the ratio between the two, native species cover, exotic species cover, and the ratio of exotic/native cover were investigated. Age, shape and proximity of remnants had few or no effects on the dependent variables. Size appeared to affect the condition variables only through habitat heterogeneity. The nature of the surrounding vegetation and fire and grazing management were the critical independent variables. However, the different aspects of integrity had different relationships with these variables.
2055246132	The Egyptian locust, Anacridium aegyptium, has four protocerebral neurosecretory centres: the A to B neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis (the A cells are rich in fuchsinophil material and the B cells are devoid of fuchsinophil neurosecretion), the voluminous C neurosecretory cells poor in neurosecretion, and the median sub-ocellar neurosecretory cells.  From September to the beginning of January, imaginal diapause is characterized by an accumulation of the median neurosecretion in the pars intercerebralis-corpora cardiaca system, by small corpora allata, and, in the female, by a stop in oocyte development although the male's sexual activity is still not altered. Allatectomy suppresses neither the male's sexual behaviour nor its fecundity. From January, the increase of the photoperiod causes a release of the median neurosecretion in both sexes, an increase of the volume of the corpora allata, and breaks ovarian diapause.  In autumn, the implantation of the male's or female's corpora allata of Anacridium does not stimulate ovarian growth of diapausing females. On the contrary, the implantation of corpora allata or of pars intercerebralis or of corpora cardiaca of Locusta migratoria migratorioides (locust without diapause) causes ovarian development of the diapausing females of Anacridium. Thus, in the two sexes of the Egyptian locust, the corpora allata are inactive during the female ovarian diapause. The imaginal diapause of Anacridium affects both sexes (stocking of median neurosecretion, arrest of the corpora allata). If diapause does not seem to affect the male's development, it is because its sexual activity is free from the pars intercerebralis and corpora allata.  The corpora allata of Anacridium show a sexual dimorphism in the active adult: they are smaller in the male and have more mitosis in the female. An explanation of this dimorphism is advanced.
2055246138	Environmental conditions in the Pannonian zone can be characterized with  moderate high temperature and partially water deficit during grain filling of  spring barley, although low temperature and water deficit are possible also  in period till anthesis. This study was conducted to evaluate the variation  of the duration of the period from emergence to anthesis (VP), duration of  grain filling period (GFP), plant height (PH), spikes number m-2 (SN), grains  number spike-1 (GN), thousand grains weight (GW) and yield (YIL) in spring  two-rowed barley in conditions of the Pannonian zone. All three factors;  genotype, environment and the interaction GxY affected the studied traits.  Average VP was 777 GDD, GFP 782 GDD, PH 78 cm, SN 523, GN 28.2, GW 43.2 g and  YIL 6.26 t ha-1. Variation across varieties was higher than across growing  seasons. Heritability varied from 0.66 for YIL to 0.94 for VP and GFP. This  study confirmed that a sufficiently large genetic variability must be base  for selecting appropriate varieties for the Pannonian zone conditions. In  order to determine high yielding and quality barley extensive research in  relation to breeding, variety choice for production and growing practice must  be done.
2055246139	Background: Genetic variation is an essential means of evolution and adaptation in many organisms in response to environmental change. Certain DNA alterations can be carried out by site-specific recombinases (SSRs) that fall into two families: the serine and the tyrosine recombinases. SSRs are seldom found in eukaryotes. A gene homologous to a tyrosine site-specific recombinase has been identified in the genome of Plasmodium falciparum. The sequence is highly conserved among five other members of Plasmodia. Methodology/Principal Findings: The predicted open reading frame encodes for a ,57 kDa protein containing a Cterminal domain including the putative tyrosine recombinase conserved active site residues R-H-R-(H/W)-Y. The N-terminus has the typical alpha-helical bundle and potentially a mixed alpha-beta domain resembling that of l-Int. Pf-Int mRNA is expressed differentially during the P. falciparum erythrocytic life stages, peaking in the schizont stage. Recombinant Pf-Int and affinity chromatography of DNA from genomic or synthetic origin were used to identify potential DNA targets after sequencing or micro-array hybridization. Interestingly, the sequences captured also included highly variable subtelomeric genes such as var, rif, and stevor sequences. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays with DNA were carried out to verify Pf-Int/ DNA binding. Finally, Pf-Int knock-out parasites were created in order to investigate the biological role of Pf-Int. Conclusions/Significance: Our data identify for the first time a malaria parasite gene with structural and functional features of recombinases. Pf-Int may bind to and alter DNA, either in a sequence specific or in a non-specific fashion, and may contribute to programmed or random DNA rearrangements. Pf-Int is the first molecular player identified with a potential role in genome plasticity in this pathogen. Finally, Pf-Int knock-out parasite is viable showing no detectable impact on blood stage development, which is compatible with such function.
2055246143	Definition of species limits within the rhodophyte genus Porphyra is hampered by the lack of reliable morphological markers; confusion in the taxonomy has serious implications for ecological studies. We report the results of a combined morphological and molecular analysis of plants variously referred to as P. purpurea, P. purpureo-violacea, P. umbilicalis f. laciniata and P. laciniata. All plants examined fell into one of two distinct groups: P. purpurea—monoecious with reproductive fronds divided into two distinct, but often unequal, male and female parts; P. laciniata—dioecious with fronds folding in half longitudinally when hanging vertically. All plants within a group were found to share a common nucleotide sequence for the chloroplast-borne rbcL-S spacer; a single nucleotide transition separates the two groups.
2055246235	The distribution of the neuronal type of nitric oxide synthase in the goldfish brain and spinal cord was investigated via NADPH-diaphorase histochemistry and immunocytochemistry using an antiserum raised against the purified mammalian enzyme. Many structures, including magnocellular neurosecretory cells, motoneurons, mesencephalic trigeminal neurons, and radial glial fibers, were stained by the NADPH-diaphorase reaction but were not immunoreactive. This nonspecific NADPH-diaphorase activity was strongly reduced after preincubation of the sections. Therefore, when sections were first reacted for immunofluorescence and, thereafter, stained for NADPH-diaphorase, a corresponding staining pattern was obtained that allowed the reliable localization of neuronal nitric oxide synthase based on both complementary staining methods. In the telencephalon, positive neurons were concentrated in the ventral and posterior parts of the area ventralis. Many intensely stained neurons were present in various diencephalic nuclei, including the nucleus centralis posterior and the ventromedial nucleus of the thalamus, the nucleus tori lateralis, the nucleus recessus lateralis, the nucleus tuberis posterior, and the central nucleus of the inferior lobe. In the midbrain, neurons containing nitric oxide synthase were located in the periventricular zone of the optic tectum, the nucleus vermiformis, and the nucleus reticularis mesencephali. Specific staining in the cerebellum was concentrated in Golgi cells. In the hindbrain, nitroxergic neurons were numerous in all four sensory nuclei of the trigeminus, in the facial lobe, the superior olive, the inferior reticular formation, and the medial general visceral nucleus of the vagus. The dorsal horn of the spinal cord was enriched with positive neurons. A few strongly stained cells were also present in the ventral horn. In conclusion, neurons capable of synthesizing nitric oxide occur throughout the teleost central nervous system. The presence of nitric oxide synthase in projection areas of most afferent nerves suggests a widespread involvement of nitric oxide in sensory information processing. The distribution of nitric oxide synthase-containing neurons in certain areas, e.g., the tectum opticum and the spinal cord, indicates an evolutionarily conserved pattern. Similar to the case in other vertebrates, there appears to be no comprehensive overlap between the distribution of nitric oxide synthase and that of any other chemically characterized neuronal population described thus far. However, strongly positive cell groups in the mesencephalic reticular formation suggest the idea of an evolutionarily conserved mesopontine cholinergic system coexpressing nitric oxide synthase.
2055246264	Virtually every endocytic compartment has been claimed to be an MIIC, a site where class II molecules accumulate. Here, it is argued that the definition of MIIC is not accurate and often pointless. MIIC can better be used as a working title for a collection of late endocytic compartments that contain the goodies necessary for efficient peptide loading of class II molecules.
2055246332	Euseius gallicus is reported from four additional European countries: Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Turkey. It is recorded from 4 plant species belonging to 4 families (Convolvulaceae, Malvaceae, Rosaceae and Solanaceae). Measurements based on collected adult females are provided. Finally, comparisons and further observations of type specimens have shown some mistakes on leg chaetotaxy to the original description. The corrected chaetotactic formula is therefore provided.
2943218377	Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is a vital enzyme that hydrolyzes acetylcholine. Here, full-length complementary DNAs (cDNAs) of two acetylcholinesterase genes (SeAce1 and SeAce2) were obtained from Spodoptera exigua, a widespread phytophagous pest in agriculture. The complete SeAce1 cDNA comprised 5447 nucleotides including an open reading frame (ORF) encoding 694 amino acids, while SeAce2 cDNA encompassed a 1917-bp ORF which would likely yield 638 amino acids. Both SeAce1 and SeAce2 contained specific characteristics of functional AChE. A phylogenetic tree of all lepidopteran insect Aces showed S. exigua clustered with S. litura, Helicoverpa assulta, and H. armigera, all of which are Noctuidae. In S. exigua, SeAce1 gene expression levels (reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction [RT-PCR] and quantitative RT-PCR) were markedly increased compared with SeAce2 in all developmental phases and tissue types. Both genes were down regulated by inserting the corresponding dsRNAs in 5th instar larvae, which resulted in 56.7% (SeAce1) and 24.6% (SeAce2) death. Downregulation of both SeAce1 and SeAce2 significantly reduced fecundity and vitellogenin gene expression in S. exigua. These results revealed the biological functions of the two Ace genes (SeAce1 and SeAce2), providing novel insights into the development of strategies for controlling insect pests.
2943218418	Abstract The response to drugs of abuse is a combination of aversive and reinforcing reactions. While much is known about the role of dopamine in mammalian drug reinforcement, we know little about the brain circuits mediating drug aversion. Here we show that two distinct dopaminergic circuits mediate reinforcing and acute aversive responses to alcohol consumption in Drosophila. Protocerebral anterior medial dopamine neurons projecting to the mushroom bodies are required for flies to acquire alcohol preference. Conversely, a bilateral pair of dopamine neurons projecting to the dorsal fan-shaped body (dFSB) mediates acute alcohol avoidance. Alcohol consumption can be reduced by decreasing the activity of the appetitive reinforcement-circuit to the mushroom bodies, or by increasing activity in the dopamine neurons projecting to the dFSB. Thus, distinct dopaminergic pathways can be targeted to reduce the intake of harmful drugs.
2943218557	Sulfurtransferases (STRs) constitute a large and complex protein family characterized by the presence of a rhodanese domain and implicated in diverse molecular and signaling processes as sulfur carriers. Although sulfurtransferases are present in the three domains of life and share evolutionary relationships, a high variability exists at different levels including the protein length and active site sequence, the presence of an indispensable catalytic cysteine residue, the domain arrangement and the subcellular localization. Because only Arabidopsis thaliana sequences have been inventoried so far, this paper aims at providing a detailed classification and inventory of evolutionary features of this family in photosynthetic organisms using comparative genomics, focusing on the oak genome. Based on the expansion of STRs in higher photosynthetic organisms, we classified the STR family in nine clusters depending on their primary sequence and domain arrangement. We found that oak possesses at least one isoform in all defined clusters and that clusters IV, V and VI contain plant-specific isoforms that are located mostly in chloroplasts. The novel classification proposed here provides the basis for functional genomics approaches in order to dissect the biochemical characteristics and physiological functions of individual STR representatives.
2943218646	Glycoconjugate vaccines against bacteria are one of the success stories of modern medicine and have led to a significant reduction in the global occurrence of bacterial meningitis and pneumonia. Glycoconjugate vaccines are produced by covalently linking a bacterial polysaccharide (usually capsule, or more recently O-antigen), to a carrier protein. Given the success of glycoconjugate vaccines, it is surprising that to date only vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae type b, Neisseria meningitis and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been fully licenced. This is set to change through the glycoengineering of recombinant vaccines in bacteria, such as Escherichia coli, that act as mini factories for the production of an inexhaustible and renewable supply of pure vaccine product. The recombinant process, termed Protein Glycan Coupling Technology (PGCT) or bioconjugation, offers a low-cost option for the production of pure glycoconjugate vaccines, with the in-built flexibility of adding different glycan/protein combinations for custom made vaccines. Numerous vaccine candidates have now been made using PGCT, which include those improving existing licenced vaccines (e.g., pneumococcal), entirely new vaccines for both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, and (because of the low production costs) veterinary pathogens. Given the continued threat of antimicrobial resistance and the potential peril of bioterrorist agents, the production of new glycoconjugate vaccines against old and new bacterial foes is particularly timely. In this review, we will outline the component parts of bacterial PGCT, including recent advances, the advantages and limitations of the technology, and future applications and perspectives.
2943218700	ABSTRACT Here, we report the draft genome sequence for a new putative genus and species in the Methanoregulaceae family, whose members are generally slow-growing rod-shaped or coccoid methanogenic archaea. The information on this sediment-dwelling organism sheds light on the prokaryotes inhabiting isolated, deep, and extremely cold methane-rich environments.
2943218980	We found an Ornithodoros species with distinct morphological characteristics than Alveonasus genus and other O. (Pavlovskyella) species group. Tick specimens were collected from a porcupine burrow, located in Lorestan province, western Iran. Genomic DNA of tick was extracted using CTAB and then three gene fragments of cytochrome oxidase subunit I (COI) and 16S mtDNA & 18S rDNA were amplified by PCR. Tick specimens were identified as near to O. (P.) verrucosus and O. (P.) tholozani. So the identification was confirmed by BLAST analysis of 16S mtDNA & 18S rDNA and COI gene fragments. A taxonomic key to the native adult subfamily Ornithodorinae species of Iran are provided to facilitate their identification.
2943219164	Functional metagenomics is the study of collective genomes of uncultured organisms from the environment, by expressing these collective genomes in host organisms. Due to introduction of new genomics techniques, advances have been made in the field of functional metagenomics. Despite these advances, metagenomic exploration is hampered by the inability to effectively express and screen the metagenome. This paper summarizes the major bottlenecks in functional assignment of metagenomes at present time. Providing an overview of the general metagenomic assessment strategy, with a focus on the challenges that are met in the screening for and selection of genes from metagenomic libraries. To identify possible screening limitations, the expression process is reviewed from the transcription level all the way to the secretion of the gene product. Special attention is paid on aspects of codon bias usage. Three major hurdles in functional metagenomics are identified. 1) The difficulty to extract and amplify DNA of sufficient length, quality and representiveness from the environment. 2) The inability to successfully express a large part of metagenomic libraries in hosts. 3) The selection and screening for hosts that are expressing metagenomic library inserts of interest.
3149573308	Maize rough dwarf disease (MRDD) is a worldwide viral disease and causes significant yield losses in maize (Zea mays L.) production. In this study, we mapped and characterized quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to MRDD using 89 F8 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between X178 (resistant parent) and B73 (susceptible). The population was evaluated for MRDD resistance in Baoding, Hebei Province, China (a hot spot of MRDD incidence) under natural infection in 2008 and 2009 and artificial inoculation in 2010. Genotypic variances for disease severity index (DSI) were highly signifi- cant in the population. Heritability estimates for DSI evaluation were 0.472 and 0.467 in 2008 and 2009, respectively. The linkage map was constructed using 514 gene-derived single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 72 simple sequence repeat markers, spanning a genetic distance of 1,059.72 cM with an average interval of 1.8 cM between adjacent markers. Multiple-QTL model mapping detected a major QTL for MRDD resistance on chromosome 8, explaining 24.6-37.3% of the phenotypic variation across three environments. In 2010, an additional QTL was detected on chromosome 10, explaining 15.8% of the phenotypic variation. The major QTL on chromo- some 8 and the SNP markers (SNP31, SNP548, and SNP284) co-located with the QTL peak have potential for further functional genomic analysis and use in molecular marker-assisted selection for MRDD resis- tance in maize.

2943219453	Approaches for Enrichment of Pasta The aims of the food enrichment are substitution of the nutrients that were lost during processing and storage of the foods as well as prevention of diseases due to inadequate consumption of basic nutrients. Pasta is the most consumed food product after bread among bakeries. There are various enrichment studies for pasta because of it’s widely consumption by every age. In order to increase the nutritional value of pasta, different sources has been used for enrichment. Therefore, textural, antioxidant and sensory properties of pasta were investigated. In this review, various applications of pasta enrichment were discussed.
2055246444	The three-dimensional fine structure of cells composing the renal tissue was demonstrated by SEM after the removal of extracellular matrices by NaOH maceration. This paper focuses on glomerular mesangial cells, Goormaghtigh's cells (extraglomerular mesangial cells), and epithelial cells in the thin limbs of Henle's loop in the rat, rabbit and dog.Mesangial cells reveal rough surfaces covered with short microvilli. The cells extend long branching processes in close association with the glomerular capillary, suggesting a role for them of regulating the capillary caliber. The mesangial cells interdigitate with each other by their microvilli, forming an intercellular labyrinth. Goormaghtigh's cells at the glomerular hilus are also covered with microvilli, which form narrow labyrinthine spaces between the cells. The labyrinth among the mesangial cells and that among Goormaghtigh's cells connect with each other at the hilus, giving rise to a channel system leading from the periphery of the glomerulus through the hilus to the interstitial space outside the glomerulus.Renal tubule cells display complicated intra- and intercellular interdigitations on the basal aspect. The pattern of epithelial interdigitation is specific to each tubular segment. The descending and ascending thin limbs of the long loops demonstrate a striking contrast to each other. The former is characterized by moderate intercellular interdigitation and by numerous microvilli on the lateral and basal surfaces; the latter is marked by elaborate, pectineal interdigitations, and by smooth basolateral surfaces.
2055246479	Abstract Platelets fixed in formalin are agglutinated by the lectins ricinus communis I (RCI), E-phytohaemagglutinin(E-PHA) and Concanavalin A (Con A). This agglutination is therefore independent of metabolic cell function. Glanzmann's disease platelets fixed in formalin agglutinate normally with RCI and E-PHA but not with Con A. Glanzmann's disease platelets fixed in formalin have a greatly reduced binding capacity for Con A compared with similarly treated normal platelets. Con A may be a useful probe to explore further the glycoprotein abnormality in Glanzmann's disease.
2055246488	SINCE Hirsch's1 theory of the Golgi presubstance, according to which there exist homogeneous granular mass as a precursor of the ‘Golgi’ system, there has been very little attempt to investigate the origin of these inclusions in the cell. Nath and Chopra2 reported the origin of ‘Golgi dictyosomes’ from mitochondria in the spermatocytes of the slug, Anadenus altivagus. However, such a conclusion was arrived at on the basis of morphological study inasmuch as the ‘Golgi dictyosomes’ disappear at the metaphase and anaphase stages of meiosis I and II, probably merging into the mitochondria ; they again appear in the respective telophase stages by the alignment of lipid granules, which seemed to take their origin from the mitochondria. These observations were later confirmed by Nath and Gupta3 in the living spermatocytes of Anadenus and Euaustenia under phase-contrast microscopy.
2055246505	Summary Objective Congenital dislocation of the hip (CDH), which is one of the most common congenital skeletal disorders, corresponds to an abnormal seating of the femoral head in the acetabulum. It is commonly admitted that CDH presents a genetic component. However, little is known about the genetic factors involved. This study aimed to determine the role of two potential candidate genes on chromosome 17 in CDH: HOXB9 (involved in limb embryonic development) and COL1A1 (involved in joint laxity). Method We set up a case-control association study (239 cases and 239 controls) in western Brittany (France) where CDH is particularly frequent. The set of informative single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each gene was selected using Tagger and genotyped using the SNaPshot ® method ( n =2 and n =10, respectively). The association was tested both through single-locus and haplotype-based analyses, using SAS and Haploview softwares. In addition, we carried out the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) with the same polymorphisms from a sample of 81 trios (i.e., 81 patients included in the case-control study and their both parents). Results The case-control study revealed no significant association between CDH and the tagSNPs selected in both HOXB9 and COL1A1 . Moreover, the TDT did not reveal distortion in allelic and haplotype transmission of the studied markers. Conclusion Our study did not support an association between HOXB9 and COL1A1 and CDH in our population. These negative findings were obtained by population- and family-based designs. Analysis of the genetic component of CDH should focus on other candidate genes.
2055246572	Some Leishmania species affect humans in two principal forms: visceral and cutaneous leishmaniosis (CL). Several studies have identified dogs as the main reservoirs of the visceral leishmaniosis (VL) caused by Leishmania infantum. The purpose of this work was to carry out a survey of the canine population associated with human cases of American tegumentary leishmaniosis (ATL), in order to establish the clinical, parasitological, serological and immunological characteristics of the canine disease, in an endemic region for both ATL and Chagas' disease in the province of Salta, in northwestern Argentina. Two hundred and eight dogs from the endemic area were examined and 41 (19.7%) of them presented lesions compatible with leishmaniosis. In order to investigate the presence of antibodies against Leishmania spp. and Trypanosoma cruzi, sera were screened by ELISA using two complex antigens from these parasites and, because of cross-reactions between them, a specific antigen for diagnosis of T. cruzi infection. Sixty-two (29.8%) of 208 dogs were positive for the complex antigen F45 from Leishmania and 50 (24%) were positive for the complex antigen F105 from T. cruzi. Nine dogs (4.3%) were positive for the specific Ag163B6-cruzipain suggesting that these dogs were truly infected with T. cruzi. Furthermore, three of these nine dogs presented Leishmania sp. in their skin lesions and therefore were considered as infected by both, T. cruzi and Leishmania parasites. The prevalence of Leishmania infection detected by lesions and/or positive serology was 27.4% (57/208). On the basis of previous observations regarding the clustered appearance of human ATL, the dog population was divided into two groups: zone A, dogs living within a 100 m radius from houses with human cases, and zone B, dogs living beyond this limit. The prevalence of ATL in dogs was significantly higher in zone A (34.6%) than in zone B (7.3%), suggesting a strong correlation between canine and human cases. The average time required for a parasitological diagnosis by microscopy was six times longer for dog samples than human ones, and the average number of parasites per 100 microscopic fields was 14-fold lower in canine samples. The high prevalence of Leishmania infection and the close association with human cases, demonstrated that dogs are a very susceptible host for Leishmania infection, but the scarcity of parasites in their lesions suggests that they may not be the main reservoir of the parasite in this endemic area.
2055246618	Loss of self-tolerance and expansion of auto-reactive lymphocytes are the basis for autoimmunity. Apoptosis and the rapid clearance of apoptotic cells by phagocytes usually occur as coordinated processes that ensure regulated cellularity and stress response with non-pathological outcomes. Defects in clearance of apoptotic cells would contribute to the generation of self-reactive lymphocytes, which drive autoimmune disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). The IL-12 family of cytokines (IL-12, IL-23, and IL-27) and IL-10 are produced by phagocytic macrophages and play critical roles in the regulation of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and effector lymphocytes during an immune response to pathogens. Inappropriate expression of these cytokines and their dysregulated activities have been strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of several autoimmune diseases. The production of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines by phagocytic APCs is delicately regulated during the ingestion of apoptotic cells as part of an intrinsic mechanism to prevent inflammatory autoimmune reactions. How apoptotic cell-derived signals regulate cytokine production is poorly understood. A recent study by our group demonstrated that phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by activated macrophages results in strong inhibition of IL-12 p35 gene expression by activating a novel transcription repressor, which we named GC-binding protein (GC-BP), through tyrosine dephosphorylation. We are also beginning to understand the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptotic cell-triggered production of IL-10 by phagocytes. These studies will help to elucidate some novel immune regulatory mechanisms and explore the regulation of immune responses to autoantigens with potentials to discover new therapeutic targets for the treatment of autoimmune disorders.
2055246771	Objective The purpose of this study was to determine syncytiotrophoblast intercellular adhesion molecule–1 expression in villitis and in normal chorionic villi from term (37-42 weeks of gestation) placentas with or without villitis. Study design A cross-sectional study was conducted to determine syncytiotrophoblast intercellular adhesion molecule–1 expression in villitis (n = 16) and in normal villi from placentas with or without villitis (n = 16). Villitis was diagnosed with antibodies to human leukocyte antigen-DR and CD3 and hematoxylin and eosin staining of serial sections; intercellular adhesion molecule–1 reactivity in syncytiotrophoblast was confirmed with antibodies to intercellular adhesion molecule–1 and cytokeratin. Results Villitis lesions had higher syncytiotrophoblast intercellular adhesion molecule–1 expression than normal chorionic villi from placentas with (19.9% vs 3.5% villi; P Conclusion Placentas with villitis have significantly more syncytiotrophoblast intercellular adhesion molecule–1 expression than placentas without villitis. The finding that normal villi from placentas with villitis have more syncytiotrophoblast intercellular adhesion molecule–1 than normal villi from placentas without villitis suggests that syncytiotrophoblast intercellular adhesion molecule–1 could be the first step in villitis development.
2055246845	The mechanisms by which mutant connexins lead to disease are diverse, including those of connexin50 (CX50) encoded by the GJA8 gene. We investigated the cellular and functional behavior of CX50fs, a mutant CX50 that has a frameshift after amino acid 255 and causes recessive congenital cataracts. Cellular levels of CX50fs were much lower than those of wild type CX50 in stably transfected HeLa cells. Whereas CX50 localized at distinct gap junction plaques and supported extensive intercellular transfer of Neurobiotin, CX50fs gap junctions were rare, and their support of Neurobiotin transfer was reduced by >90%. After inhibition of new protein synthesis with cycloheximide, CX50fs disappeared much more rapidly than CX50, suggesting increased degradation of the mutant. Treatment of cells with epoxomicin (a proteasomal inhibitor) led to a dramatic increase in CX50fs levels and in the abundance of gap junctions. Epoxomicin treatment also rescued intercellular transfer of Neurobiotin to levels similar to those in cells expressing the wild type protein. Treatment with eeyarestatin I (an inhibitor of p97-dependent protein degradation) resulted in many abundant slowly migrating CX50 and CX50fs bands consistent with polyubiquitination of the proteins. These results demonstrate that the CX50fs mutant is rapidly degraded by endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in mammalian cells. This accelerated degradation reduces the abundance of gap junctions and the extent of intercellular communication, potentially explaining the pathogenesis of cataracts linked to this mutant. The efficacy of epoxomicin in restoring function suggests that protease inhibition might have therapeutic value for this and other diseases caused by mutants with similar defects.
2055246886	The pathogenetic roles of autoantibodies remain unknown in systemic sclerosis (SSc). CD19, a cell-surface critical signal transduction molecule of B lymphocytes, augments signaling through B cell antigen receptor and CD19 overexpression in mice induces various autoantibody production. Peripheral B cells from SSc patients exhibit 20%-increase in CD19 expression. Furthermore, B cells from a tight-skin (TSK) mouse, a genetic murine model of SSc, show augmented signaling through CD19. The deficiency of CD19 expression in TSK mice results in inhibition of autoantibody production, reduced skin fibrosis, and inhibition of augmented IL-6 production by splenic B cells. Collectively, a new model that could explain the relationship between autoantibody and the development of fibrosis is proposed. CD19 overexpression observed in SSc patients breaks down peripheral tolerance of B cells, which results in autoantibody production. Furthermore, it is also possible that in vivo chronic B cell activation probably due to CD19 overexpression results in the development of fibrosis through production of fibrogenic cytokines, such as IL-6. This model indicates that B cells or CD19 would be potential therapeutic targets in SSc.

2943220177	A novel marine bacterium, designated strain GH1-24T, was isolated from a tidal mudflat sample collected at Gangwha Island, Republic of Korea. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparison exhibited that the novel isolate was most closely related to Sneathiellaand formed a tight cluster with Sneathiellaglossodoripedis JCM 23214T with 98.1 % sequence similarity. The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to other Sneathiellaspecies were low: Sneathiellachinensis LMG 23452T (96.1 %) and Sneathiellachungangensis CAU 1294T (95.8 %). Cells of the organism were Gram-reaction-negative, strictly aerobic, catalase- and oxidase-positive, motile rods and showed growth at 0.5–6 % NaCl, 20–42 °C and pH 6.0–8.0. The G+C content of the DNA was 54.9 mol%. The major isoprenoid quinone was Q-10. The major cellular fatty acids were C18 : 1ω7c, C16 : 0 and C19 : 0cyclo ω8c. The polar lipids were phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified aminophospholipid. The results of phenotypic and phylogenetic analyses and DNA–DNA relatedness studies suggest that the isolate can be a member of a novel species of the genus Sneathiella, for which the name Sneathiellalimimaris sp. nov. is proposed. The type strain is GH1-24T (=KCTC 52846T=NBRC 113276T)
2943220296	While the roles of parenchymal microglia in brain homeostasis and disease are fairly clear, other brain-resident myeloid cells remain less well understood. By dissecting border regions and combining single-cell RNA-sequencing with high-dimensional cytometry, bulk RNA-sequencing, fate-mapping and microscopy, we reveal the diversity of non-parenchymal brain macrophages. Border-associated macrophages (BAMs) residing in the dura mater, subdural meninges and choroid plexus consisted of distinct subsets with tissue-specific transcriptional signatures, and their cellular composition changed during postnatal development. BAMs exhibited a mixed ontogeny, and subsets displayed distinct self-renewal capacity following depletion and repopulation. Single-cell and fate-mapping analysis both suggested that there is a unique microglial subset residing on the apical surface of the choroid plexus epithelium. Finally, gene network analysis and conditional deletion revealed IRF8 as a master regulator that drives the maturation and diversity of brain macrophages. Our results provide a framework for understanding host-macrophage interactions in both the healthy and diseased brain.
2943220352	The combination of chronic dietary exposure to the fungal toxin, aflatoxin B1 (AFB1), and hepatitis B viral (HBV) infection is associated with an increased risk for early onset hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs). An in-depth knowledge of the mechanisms driving carcinogenesis is critical for the identification of genetic risk factors affecting the susceptibility of individuals who are HBV infected and AFB1 exposed. AFB1-induced mutagenesis is characterized by G to T transversions. Hence, the DNA repair pathways that function on AFB1-induced DNA adducts or base damage from HBV-induced inflammation are anticipated to have a strong role in limiting carcinogenesis. These pathways define the mutagenic burden in the target tissues and ultimately limit cellular progression to cancer. Murine data have demonstrated that NEIL1 in the DNA base excision repair pathway was significantly more important than nucleotide excision repair relative to elevated risk for induction of HCCs. These data suggest that deficiencies in NEIL1 could contribute to the initiation of HCCs in humans. To investigate this hypothesis, publicly-available data on variant alleles of NEIL1 were analyzed and compared with genome sequencing data from HCC tissues derived from individuals residing in Qidong County (China). Three variant alleles were identified and the corresponding A51V, P68H, and G245R enzymes were characterized for glycosylase activity on genomic DNA containing a spectrum of oxidatively-induced base damage and an oligodeoxynucleotide containing a site-specific AFB1-formamidopyrimidine guanine adduct. Although the efficiency of the P68H variant was modestly decreased, the A51V and G245R variants showed nearly wild-type activities. Consistent with biochemical findings, molecular modeling of these variants demonstrated only slight local structural alterations. However, A51V was highly temperature sensitive suggesting that its biological activity would be greatly reduced. Overall, these studies have direct human health relevance pertaining to genetic risk factors and biochemical pathways previously not recognized as germane to induction of HCCs.
2943220414	Patient-specific induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) are a powerful tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying Parkinson's disease (PD), and might provide novel platforms for systematic drug screening. Several strategies have been developed to generate iPSC-derived tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-positive dopaminergic neurons (DAn), the clinically relevant cell type in PD; however, they often result in mixed neuronal cultures containing only a small proportion of TH-positive DAn. To overcome this limitation, we used CRISPR/Cas9-based editing to generate a human iPSC line expressing a fluorescent protein (mOrange) knocked-in at the last exon of the TH locus. After differentiation of the TH-mOrange reporter iPSC line, we confirmed that mOrange expression faithfully mimicked endogenous TH expression in iPSC-derived DAn. We also employed calcium imaging techniques to determine the intrinsic functional differences between dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic ventral midbrain neurons. Crucially, the brightness of mOrange allowed direct visualization of TH-expressing cells in heterogeneous cultures, and enabled us to isolate live mOrange-positive cells through fluorescence-activated cell sorting, for further differentiation. This technique, coupled to refined imaging and data processing tools, could advance the investigation of PD pathogenesis and might offer a platform to test potential new therapeutics for PD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
2943220662	Medicinal plants from the marine ecosystem are a rich source of medicinal plants having a potential for miracle drugs. It is clear from the observation that the local inhabitants of Pichavaram mangrove forest have excellent knowledge about the phytomedicine. Thus they have developed their traditional system of utilizing these mangroves for medicinal purposes. Cancer is the name given to a collection of related and multistep disease. In all types of cancer, a few of the body's cells begin to divide without stopping and spread into the surrounding. It is developed by environmental, physical, chemical, metabolic and genetic factors. In this study, methanol was used to prepare an extract from A. marina leaves and screened for anticancer activity. The phytoconstituents like alkaloids, flavonoids, saponin and tannin present in the extract were quantified, and anticancer activity of the same was identified. Further, the apoptotic cell death effect of methanol extract on the Hela cell line was determined. The flavonoids of A. marina showed higher anti-cancer activity on Hela cells followed by tannin, alkaloids and saponin. The result of the apoptotic cell death effect of A. marina may provide an effective therapeutic strategy against cervical cancer. Finally, it is concluded that the extract of A. marina exhibited anticancer activity.
2943220887	Tumor necrosis factor receptor (TNFR) superfamily members, including 4-1BB, OX40, GITR and CD27 contribute to T cell survival during viral infection. However, the cell types that provide the ligands have not been fully investigated. Here we use multiparameter flow cytometry to follow the induction of TNF family ligands on APC subsets during lymphoytic choriomeningitis (LCMV) clone 13 infection. We found that at day 2 post infection, type I interferon induced TNFSF ligands GITRL, 4-1BBL, OX40L, and CD70 predominantly on monocyte-derived APCs, whereas MHC II and B7 family ligands are highest on classical dendritic cells (cDCs) in the spleen. These findings shed light on the expression of TNF family ligands by different APC and suggest that the temporal and spatial regulation of these ligands may be important in determining immune control or pathology during viral infections.%%%%M.Sc.
2055246978	The effects of temperature and wetness duration on release and germination of ascospores of Podosphaera clandestina, causal agent of sweet cherry powdery mildew, were determined in controlled-environment studies. Ascospore release occurred in the presence of free water at temperatures between 5 and 30 C and at wetness durations as short as 1 h. Spore release increased rapidly between 2 and 4 h wetness durations, and after 8 h was optimal at 15-20 C (...)
2055246988	High Plains virus (HPV) isolates from Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Texas, and Utah were serologically related, had similar relative molecular masses (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) for the 32-kDa diagnostic HPV protein, and were transmissible and maintained free of Wheat streak mosaic virus (WSMV) by vascular puncture inoculation. Collections of wheat curl mites (Aceria tosichella Keifer; WCM) from Kansas, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Texas differentially transmitted these isolates. For collections from South Dakota and Texas, little or no HPV transmission occurred, whereas WCM from Nebraska and Montana transmitted all five isolates. The collection from Kansas mostly transmitted only one HPV isolate. Aviruliferous or viruliferous WSMV Nebraska WCM transmitted HPV at similar rates and aviruliferous Montana WCM transmitted HPV at lower levels than viruliferous Montana WCM.
2055247103	"The sliding clamp is an essential component of the replisome required for processivity of DNA synthesis and several other aspects of chromosome metabolism. However, the in vivo dynamics of the clamp are poorly understood. We have used various biochemical and cell biological methods to study the dynamics of clamp association with the replisome in Bacillus subtilis cells. We find that clamps form large assemblies on DNA, called ""clamp zones."" Loading depends on DnaG primase and is probably driven by Okazaki fragment initiation on the lagging strand. Unloading, which is probably regulated, only occurs after many clamps have accumulated on the DNA. On/off cycling allows chromosomal zones of about 200 accumulated clamps to follow the replisome. Since we also show that clamp zones recruit proteins bearing a clamp-binding sequence to replication foci, the results highlight the clamp as a central organizer in the structure and function of replication foci."
2055247131	Dendritic cells are the principal initiators of antigen-specific immune responses. The mechanisms by which they activate resting, naive T cells are increasingly well understood. Dendritic cells have several molecules on their surface that are critical for T-cell activation; they secrete multiple soluble factors that are important for T-cell differentiation and growth; and they home to areas in lymphoid organs that are rich in effector T cells. This knowledge has led to the belief that delivery of antigens with dendritic cells that have been manipulated ex vivo could stimulate powerful cellular immune responses against tumors. Pilot clinical trials indicate that dendritic cell vaccines can induce efficacious tumor-specific immune responses.
2055247169	Open reading frame expressed sequences tags (ORESTES) differ from conventional ESTs by providing sequence data from the central protein coding portion of transcripts. We generated a total of 696,745 ORESTES sequences from 24 human tissues and used a subset of the data that correspond to a set of 15,095 full-length mRNAs as a means of assessing the efficiency of the strategy and its potential contribution to the definition of the human transcriptome. We estimate that ORESTES sampled over 80% of all highly and moderately expressed, and between 40% and 50% of rarely expressed, human genes. In our most thoroughly sequenced tissue, the breast, the 130,000 ORESTES generated are derived from transcripts from an estimated 70% of all genes expressed in that tissue, with an equally efficient representation of both highly and poorly expressed genes. In this respect, we find that the capacity of the ORESTES strategy both for gene discovery and shotgun transcript sequence generation significantly exceeds that of conventional ESTs. The distribution of ORESTES is such that many human transcripts are now represented by a scaffold of partial sequences distributed along the length of each gene product. The experimental joining of the scaffold components, by reverse transcription-PCR, represents a direct route to transcript finishing that may represent a useful alternative to full-length cDNA cloning.
2055247172	Abstract Glycogen synthase kinase (GSK) 3α and 3β are two proline-directed serine/threonine kinases that have been shown in vitro to hyperphosphorylate tau, and therefore, may contribute to neurofibillary tangle (NFT) formation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). We report here that, in the human hippocampal formation of both control and AD individuals, GSK 3α and 3β are immunohistochemically localized to neurons within the presubiculum > CA1, CA3, and CA4 subfields of the hippocampus, layers III > II > IV, V, VI of entorhinal cortex, and occasional neurons in layers III, V, and VI of temporal neocortex. By contrast, NFTs occur primarily in CA1, subiculum, layers II and IV of entorhinal cortex, and layers II, III, and V of temporal neocortex. The presubiculum and other subfields are frequently spared. Thus, localization of GSK 3α and GSK 3β does not correspond to the expected pattern of neuronal vulnerability to NFT formation in AD. Interpreted within the limitations of immunohistochemical detection, these results argue against a major role of GSK 3α or GSK 3β in NFT formation in AD.
2055247247	The nucleotide sequence of the hydHG operon, comprised of chromosomal genes that regulate labile hydrogenase activity in Salmonella typhimurium , was compared with the reported hydHG sequence of Escherichia coli . Nucleotide sequence analysis of a 4.8 kb Eco RI fragment of Salmonella chromosomal DNA revealed that one of the open reading frames (ORF) encoded a protein of 441 amino acid residues. This large ORF was identified on a 2.7 kb Eco RI/ Hin dIII fragment and coded for the complete hydG gene. The carboxy-terminus (626 bp) of the hydH gene also was present immediately upstream of hydG . Expression of the Salmonella hydG gene in a T7 promoter/ polymerase system revealed the presence of a unique 45 kDa protein band. The incomplete hydH gene was not expressed. It is proposed that the labile hydrogenase activity in S. typhimurium may be regulated by the multiple component system.
2055247303	A dual affinity fusion concept has been developed in which the gene encoding the desired product is fused between two flanking heterologous genes encoding IgG- and albumin-binding domains. Using sequential IgG and serum albumin affinity chromatography, a full-length tripartite fusion protein is obtained. This approach was used to recover a full-length fusion product in Escherichia coli containing the human insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II). Surprisingly, the recombinant IGF-II showed increased stability against proteolytic degradation in E. coli when produced as a dual affinity fusion protein, as compared to an N-terminal fusion protein. After site-specific cleavage of the tripartite fusion protein, IGF-II molecules with immunological and receptor binding activity were obtained without renaturation steps. The results demonstrate that proteins can fold into biologically active structures, even if provided with large flanking heterologous protein domains. The concept was further used to characterize the specific degradation of recombinant IGF-II in this heterologous host.
2055247309	Abstract Using 3 H-Quinuclinidyl Benzilate ( 3 H-QNB) as a high affinity ligand for quantitative studies of specific binding to muscarinic cholinergic receptors we have demonstrated the presence of such receptors in homogenates of goldfish retina. Only one set of binding sites could be detected with an apparent dissociation constant of 1.9 × 10 −10 M and a density of 53.5 fentomoles per mg of protein. The receptor sites become saturated at a QNB concentration of 1.2 nM. The pharmacological profile of the specific binding is similar to those described for homogenates of beef and chick retina, as well as for rodent brain and smooth muscle.
2055247318	The oscillatory current response to acetylcholine (ACh) in Xenopus laevis oocytes, mediated by endogenous muscarinic ACh receptors, is known to be mildly desensitized by repetitive ACh applications. Pretreatment of oocytes with staurosporine (an inhibitor of protein kinases) was found not only to abolish this desensitization but also to positively and progressively potentiate oscillatory ACh responses. This sensitization by staurosporine was suppressed by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate (an activator of protein kinase C). In staurosporine-untreated (control) oocytes, intracellularly injected calcineurin (an isozyme of Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B) or Ca2+ enhanced oscillatory ACh responses, while trifluoperazine (a calmodulin inhibitor) suppressed the ACh responses but did not affect oscillatory responses to intracellularly injected inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. These results suggest that, as far as short-term changes in receptor responsiveness are concerned, endogenous muscarinic ACh receptors in Xenopus oocytes are desensitized by phosphorylation by protein kinase C and sensitized by dephosphorylation by Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein phosphatase 2B.
2055247460	Abstract Ranges of freshwater fish species depend on river basins. However, most species are confined to a limited area of a basin. Some limited distributions are determined by the ecology of the species, most have historical grounds. Many species are endemic to a restricted area of a river basin (e.g., 7 in the River Danube; more than 80 in the Mississippi river basin). Most non‐endemics confined to a sector of a river basin also live in one or more adjacent basins. Cases are known of conspecific subspecies inhabiting distinct areas within a river basin, some of them being also present in a neighbouring basin. Restricted distributions are determined by the fact that river captures usually involve tributaries, not the main rivers and the inhabitants of the upper and middle reaches of the river do not disperse through the lower reaches.

2943221333	Immediate early genes (IEGs) are useful markers of neuronal activation and essential components of neuronal response. While studies of gastropods have provided many insights into the basic learning and memory mechanisms, the genome-wide assessment of IEGs has been mainly restricted to vertebrates. In this study, we identified IEGs in the terrestrial snail Helix lucorum In the absence of the genome, we conducted de novo transcriptome assembly using reads with short and intermediate lengths cumulatively covering more than 98 billion nucleotides. Based on this assembly, we identified 37 proteins corresponding to contigs differentially expressed (DE) in either the parietal ganglia (PaG) or two giant interneurons located within the PaG of the snail in response to the neuronal stimulation. These proteins included homologues of well-known mammalian IEGs, such as c-jun/jund, C/EBP, c-fos/fosl2, and Egr1, as well as homologues of genes not yet implicated in the neuronal response.
2055247489	The seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii was investigated in wild and captive cetaceans from Japan. Antibodies against T. gondii were examined by both latex agglutination test (LAT) and indirect hemagglutination test (IHAT) for 77 serum or plasma samples obtained from 59 individuals of 6 species, including 2 hybrids. Antibody titers greater than 1:64 in LAT and greater than 1:640 in IHAT, indicative of the presence of T. gondii, were found in 11.9% of 59 individuals. In 7 samples that showed a positive reaction by IHAT, T. gondii titers were examined for each immunoglobulin (Ig) fraction separated by sucrose gradient centrifugation. The antibody peaks in each fraction were divided into 3 types, thought to be a reaction of IgM (type 1), IgG (type 2), and IgM with IgG (type 3). Type 1 was found in serum from a bottle-nosed dolphin (Tursiops truncatus) and a killer whale (Orcinus orca) sampled soon after capture off the Japanese coast in 1988; it was concluded that infection in the wild had occurred less than 15 yr before the study was performed. The prevalence of putative IgM and IgG antibodies from a captive-bred T. truncatus suggested that T. gondii infection also occurred in the aquarium.
2055247516	Objectives were to compare belly, bacon processing, bacon slice, and sensory characteristics from pigs fed high protein canola meal (CM-HP) or conventional canola meal (CM-CV). Soybean meal was replaced with 0 (control), 33, 66, or 100% of both types of canola meal. Left side bellies from 70 carcasses were randomly assigned to conventional or dry cure treatment and matching right side bellies were assigned the opposite treatment. Secondary objectives were to test the existence of bilateral symmetry on fresh belly characteristics and fatty acid profiles of right and left side bellies originating from the same carcass. Bellies from pigs fed CM-HP were slightly lighter and thinner than bellies from pigs fed CM-CV, yet bacon processing, bacon slice, and sensory characteristics were unaffected by dietary treatment and did not differ from the control. Furthermore, testing the existence of bilateral symmetry on fresh belly characteristics revealed that bellies originating from the right side of the carcasses were slightly (P≤0.05) wider, thicker, heavier and firmer than bellies from the left side of the carcass.
2055247521	Abstract Polyclonal antibodies raised against Cd-binding peptide from roots of Agrostis gigantea Roth were used with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The antigen was best adsorbed to Immulon 2 “U” microtitre plates in 50 mM acetic acid. The antibodies to the antigen from Agrostis cross-reacted with Cd-binding peptides from the roots of maize and tomato, but not with glutathione nor metallothioneins I and II from rabbit liver. The antibodies reacted specifically with peptides rich in cysteine and glutamate, and having glycine or serine in the least amount. Reaction of antibodies was limited to ELISA; the antiserum did not form antigen-antibody precipitates when tested by standard diffusion and immunoelectrophoretic methods.
2055247566	Prolonged administration of naloxone (5 mg/kg body weight) during the juvenile period stimulated ovarian folliculogenesis and pubescence in mice; the effect was absent in animals of other ages, when a single injection was given, or when the dose of preparation was decreased.
2055247584	The polymorphism of HLA class II (HLA-DRBI, -DQA1 and -DQBI) were investigated in 89 Shanghai Han Chinese using polymerasechain reaction amplification and oligonucleotide (PCR-SSO) typing. Of the 43 DRB1 alleles tested, 24 were observed. DRBI *0901 (16.85%), *0803 (9.55%), *1202 (9.55%) and *1501 (12.92%) were most frequent and account for the high frequencies of DR9, DR8, DR5 and DR2 specificities in this population. The alleles DRB1 *0101. *0102 and *1001 had very low frequencies. Among the 8 DQA1 and 13 DQB1 alleles tested, only DQA1 *0401 and DQB1 *0402 were absent. DQA1 *0301, and DQB1 *0301 and *0303 were among the most common alleles of the two loci respectively. Unusual DRB1-DQA1-DQB1 haplotypes were observed and a DRB1 “new” allele was suggested.
2055247648	As is known for other aphids, the symbiont cytoplasm in Rhopalosiphum padi is differentiated into a central eccentric and a cortical region which contains electron-lucent nucleoplasm and DNA fibrils. The cytoplasm is surrounded by a plasma membrane, cell wall and perisymbiotic membrane which are separated by periplasmic spaces. The periplasmic space between the cell wall and perisymbiotic membrane contains small vesicles. The symbionts are packed into mycetocyte cells which contain a large nucleus and all the normal cell organelles. For the first time, however microtubules and microfilaments have been identified, but only at high magnification and evidence has been found which makes it possible to propose a mechanism of vesicular transport.
2055247746	"The mature flavivirus capsid protein (virion C) is commonly thought to be free in the cytoplasm of infected cells and to form a nucleocapsid-like complex with genomic RNA in mature virus particles. There is little sequence conservation among flavivirus virion C proteins, but they are similar in size (e.g., 99 amino acids [aa] for the dengue-4 [DEN4] C) and in bearing a net positive charge. In addition, we noted that C contained a conserved internal hydrophobic segment (spanning aa 45-65 in the DEN4 C). Results of in vivo expression and in vitro translation of wt and mutant forms of the DEN4 virion C demonstrated that the conserved internal hydrophobic segment in the DEN C functioned as a membrane anchor domain. Signal peptide function of this segment was also suggested by its requirement for the entry of C into membranes. Virion C was integrated in membranes in a ""hairpin"" conformation; positively charged segments amino- and carboxy-terminal to the hydrophobic signal-anchor segment were accessible to protease digestion in the ""cytoplasm."" The net positive charge in the amino-terminal extramembraneous portion of C (aa 1-44) was one determinant of the hairpin membrane orientation; a conserved positively charged residue within the hydrophobic segment (Arg-54 in the DEN4 C) was not."
2055247763	Presenilins 1 and 2 (PS1/PS2) have been suggested to be γ-secretases responsible for the proteolytic cleavage of amyloid precursor protein (APP) to form amyloid-β (Aβ), a protein implicated in the development of Alzheimer's disease. Here we examined whether these presenilins are required for the generation of multiple Aβ species by analyzing the production of several forms of secreted and intracellular Aβ in mouse cells lacking PS1, PS2 or both proteins. Although most Aβ species were abolished in PS1/PS2−/− cells, the production of intracellular Aβ42 generated in the endoplasmic reticulum/intermediate compartment was unaffected by the absence of these proteins, either singly or in combination. These results indicate that production of this pool of Aβ occurs independently of PS1/PS2, and therefore, another γ-secretase activity must be responsible for cleavage of APP within the early secretory compartments.
2055247766	"SV40 T-antigen-expressing human cells generally have an extension of lifespan until a period called ""crisis"" begins. On rare occasions a clone of cells emerges from the population in crisis and gives rise to an immortalized cell line. The present study compares the frequency of immortalization of cells from two different human lineages, lung fibroblasts and mammary epithelial cells. Most of the T-antigen-transfected clones from both cell types failed to immortalize, however, within those clones which were immortalization-competent the frequency of escape from crisis was found to be much higher (10(-5)) in mammary epithelial cells than in human fibroblasts (3 x 10(-7)). The frequency of escape from crisis in fibroblasts could be increased by chemical mutagenesis or by infection with a defective retrovirus. T-antigen-transfected fibroblasts were uniformly highly aneuploid both before and after crisis. In contrast, many SV40 T-antigen- and human papilloma virus 16 E6- or E6/E7-transfected mammary epithelial clones maintained a subpopulation of pseudodiploid cells prior to crisis, and the immortal cells that emerged following crisis were generally pseudodiploid. The higher frequency of escape from crisis in mammary epithelial cells is best explained by postulating a mutational inactivation of one allele of a critical gene followed by the elimination of the remaining wild-type alleles, with a much higher frequency of this second event in mammary epithelial cells due to their reduced ploidy compared to that in T-antigen-transfected fibroblasts. The results are discussed in terms of the regulation of telomerase activity and the M1/M2 model of cellular senescence."
2055247781	Chromosomes of dwarf female cattle were observed in comparison with those of normal females and males. Normal as well as dwarf female cattle had 60 chromosomes, namely 29 telocentric autosome pairs and one submedian metacentric X pair. There was no difference in thh karyotype between normal and dwarf cattle. Male normal cattle had 29 telocentric autosome pairs and in addition a submedian X and a median metacentric Y chromosome. From the above investigation, it was considered that the character of dwarfism is not reflected in the karyotype being due to a sigle autosomal gene mutation.
2055247793	Electrical resistance (ER) measurements were taken with a Shigometer across tree cankers found on Castaneadentata, Betulalenta, and B. populifolia. Cankers were incited by Endothiaparasitica and Nectriagalligena, respectively. Measurements taken along the vertical axis of the stem were at 2-cm intervals from 8 cm above the canker margin to 8 cm below the canker. Three zones of electrical character were distinguished. The canker margin exhibited decreased ER as compared with healthy tissue, whereas ER increased in the canker face. Moisture content, mobile cation concentration, and the path of current flow were all found to contribute to ER. Multiple regression analyses indicated fundamental changes in the variables contributing to ER in summer and winter samples. Strong inverse relationships were found between ER and total ash and between ER and potassium concentrations in September. February samples, however, exhibited an inverse correlation between ER and moisture content. These data indicated that moist...
2055247813	OBJECTIVES The RON receptor mediates tumorigenic phenotypes in pancreatic cancer (PC), but no investigations currently have implicated RON signaling as a regulator of angiogenesis in PC. Angiogenesis is vital to oncogenesis, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the most well-characterized angiogenic protein. This study sought to determine the effect of RON stimulation on in vitro angiogenesis and VEGF production in PC cell lines. METHODS Vascular endothelial growth factor levels from conditioned media of hepatocyte growth factor-like protein-stimulated BxPC-3 and FG cells were quantitated via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and likewise interrogated in the presence and absence of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase/AKT inhibitors. To determine in vitro angiogenesis, human microvascular endothelial cells were subsequently exposed to the same conditioned media to assay for microtubule formation. RESULTS RON signaling resulted in a 52% and 34% increase in VEGF levels in BxPC-3 and FG cells, respectively. Vascular endothelial growth factor secretion was inhibited with MAPK or phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase blockade in BxPC-3 cells, but only MAPK inhibition resulted in decreased VEGF production in FG cells. BxPC-3 conditioned media induced tubule formation in human microvascular endothelial cells, which was abrogated by RON inhibition. CONCLUSIONS RON signaling results in MAPK-mediated VEGF secretion by PC cells and promotion of microtubule formation. These findings suggest another mechanism by which RON signaling may promote PC progression.
2055247816	Abstract The main diterpenoids in the roots of Arctopus (Apiaceae, tribe Saniculeae) have been identified for the first time. The major compounds are manool, ent- trachyloban-19-oic acid and a kauren-19-oic acid, while methyl-16β-hydroxy- ent -kaur-11-en-19-oate is a minor diterpene. Comparative studies of non-polar extracts by means of LC–MS showed that the isolated main compounds are present in all three species of Arctopus. The study also revealed that the diterpenoid pattern in Arctopus is very similar to that of the genus Alepidea . The tuberous roots of Arctopus and the rhizomes and roots of Alepidea are important traditional medicines in South Africa, used mainly for infections and respiratory ailments. Their efficacy is ascribed to antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activity. The known biological activities of the isolated diterpenes provide a scientific rationale for the traditional uses. The chemical similarity in diterpenoids also supports the idea that the two genera are closely related, despite their conspicuous morphological differences.
2055247832	Two hundred and eighty seven isolates of Rhizobium nodulating Phaseolus vulgaris L. were sampled in France from four geographically distant field populations. They were characterized by their colony morphology and by plasmid profiles. A representative sample was further characterized: a) by the ability of each isolate to nodulate a potential alternative host Leucaena leucocephala and to grow on specific media, and b) by RFLP analysis of PCR amplified 16S rRNA genes. On the basis of their phenotypic and genetic characteristics the isolates could be assigned either to Rhizobium leguminosarum bv phaseoli, or to R. tropici. The two species co-occurred at three sites. R. leguminosarum bv phaseoli represented 2%, 4%, 72% and 100% of the population at the four different sites. Eighteen and 22 different plasmid profiles were identified within R. tropici and R. leguminosarum bv phaseoli, respectively. Some of them were conserved between distant geographical regions. The fact that R. tropici was found in France shows that this species is not limited to tropical regions and gives additional evidence of the multi-specific nature of the Phaseolus microsymbiont, even over a geographically limited area.
2055247876	We analyzed the steroid sulfatase (STS) gene in nine Japanese patients with X-linked ichthyosis (XLI) by a polymerase chain reaction technique and subsequent DNA sequencing. Eight of nine patients showed complete deletion of the STS gene. In a patient of XLI exhibiting a normal amplifying pattern with predicted sizes of the STS gene, a novel mutation was found resulting in the appearance of a stop codon in exon 7 of the STS gene. This suggests that exon 7 or an area in its downstream region is important for STS activity.
2055247889	Pulmonary vascular medial hypertrophy due to enhanced pulmonary artery smooth muscle cell (PASMC) proliferation and/or decreased PASMC apoptosis is a primary cause of increased pulmonary vascular resistance and arterial pressure in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension. While many factors can contribute to this form of vascular remodeling, it is generally agreed upon that altered transmembrane ion flux via ion channels is involved. While much focus has centered on the role of cations and cation channels in controlling PASMC contraction and proliferation, anion efflux via Cl− channels has recently gained interest for its role in SMC proliferation, differentiation, migration, contraction, and angiogenesis. In this issue, Dai et al. report that the putative volume-sensitive ClC-3 channel is upregulated in PASMC from monocrotaline-induced pulmonary hypertensive rats and in inflammatory cytokine-treated canine PASMC. They also provide evidence that ClC-3 upregulation may protect against oxidative stress-induced PASMC necrosis, thereby improving PASMC survival and promoting medial hypertrophy.
2055247933	Abstract The ectodomains of interacting membrane-bound proteins, when expressed as recombinant soluble molecules, often have low affinities for each other, hampering studies of their interaction. We reasoned that stabilization of unstable protein–protein complexes should aid our understanding of the structural and functional consequences of complex formation. Here, we have used fusion with leucine zipper (LZ) domains to stabilize a complex formed between the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II) protein, HLA-DR1 (which binds peptides for presentation to CD4 + T cells) and HLA-DM (which catalyzes peptide exchange of MHC-II molecules). To this end, the DM β chain ectodomains were fused to acidic LZ domains (AcidP1 or Fos); similarly, the DR1 β chain ectodomains were fused to basic LZ domains (BaseP1 or Jun). We expressed LZ-modified soluble DM or DR1 αβ dimers, or both, in insect cells and purified the secreted sDM-AcidP1 and sDR1-BaseP1 molecules as well as the complex. LZ modification greatly enhanced DM-catalyzed peptide binding to DR1 compared to unmodified soluble DM and DR1. We readily detected LZ-modified DM/DR complexes on native PAGE gels and by coimmunoprecipitation. Thus, fusion with artificial LZ domains can stabilize unstable protein–protein complexes for biochemical and structural studies of interactions within the complex.
3149574582	The new severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) recently emerged as a worrying pandemic, with many confirmed cases and deaths globally. Therefore, there is a clear need for identifying effective therapeutic options and a review of secondary metabolites related to Brazilian herbal medicines was performed as a strategy for the discovery of new antiviral agents. To confirm this potential, an in silico screening of the identified compounds identified was also evaluated. The review was performed by the PubMed database and the selected natural compounds were subjected to in silico analysis such as QSAR, molecular docking and ADMET. 497 secondary metabolites were identified from 23 species. The in silico assays indicated 19 potential anti-SARS-CoV-2 compounds, being triterpenes and phenolic compounds. The indicated compounds showed a high affinity with proteins considered as the main molecular targets against SARS-CoV-2 and parameters indicated low toxicity. In addition to Brazilian medicinal plants, these compounds can be found in other species and they can be a base for the synthesis of other anti-COVID-19 drugs. Therefore, this review is important to conduct researches that address the emerging need for drugs in COVID-19 treatment.

2943222147	Abstract: Decline of species population, low natural regeneration, and heavy competition on field sites require the planting of large seedling stocks to restore Taxus chinensis and Phoebe chekiangensis in tropical China. In this study, we examined the effects of different formulations and application rates of controlled-release fertilizers (CRF) of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) on nursery seedling growth and nutritional attributes. The objective was to determine optimum formulation (N:P2O5 ratio) and application rate to increase nutrient reserves of the seedlings before transplanting to the field. Four formulations (17-9-13 to 19-6-14 N-P2O5-K2O ratios) and four application rates (1.5 kg m-3 to 4.5 kg m-3) were used in a double-factors factorial design with 3 replications. The results showed that CRF formulation can affect nutritional attributes, while application rate modified seedling growth and nutritional attributes. The optimum seedling response occurred with the 17-6-16 formulation at the rate of 3.5kg m-3. These findings will guide nursery practice in the production of high-quality seedlings for optimum survival and growth in the field.
2943222241	Abstract Pathogenetic process monitoring and early detection of black spot disease caused by Alternaria alternata on pear fruit is still difficult, as it causes only minor changes in the appearance of the infected area during the early stages of infection. In this study, the potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for monitoring the pathogenetic process and early detection of the disease on pear fruit was evaluated. Fresh Korla pears were inoculated with Alternaria alternata and hyperspectral images were acquired from infected and control samples. Spectral angle mapping was performed to segment the infected area from sound tissue, and to monitor the pathogenetic process of the disease. Support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbor, and partial least squares discriminant analysis models were developed and evaluated for their ability to detect early onset of the disease. Results concluded that the SVM model with an overall accuracy of 97.5% was most suitable for the proposed HSI technique. This study is the first reported attempt to use HSI to monitor the pathogenetic process and detect the early symptom of the disease in pear fruit.

2943222525	Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect many species causing a variety of diseases with a range of severities. Their members include zoonotic viruses with pandemic potential where therapeutic options are currently limited. Despite this diversity CoVs share some common features including the production, in infected cells, of elaborate membrane structures. Membranes represent both an obstacle and aid to CoV replication – and in consequence – virus-encoded structural and nonstructural proteins have membrane-binding properties. The structural proteins encounter cellular membranes at both entry and exit of the virus while the nonstructural proteins reorganize cellular membranes to benefit virus replication. Here, the role of each protein in membrane binding is described to provide a comprehensive picture of their role in the CoV replication cycle.
2943222680	Early-life adversity (ELA) in the form of stress, inflammation, or malnutrition, can increase the risk of developing psychopathology or cognitive problems in adulthood. The neurobiological substrates underlying this process remain unclear. While neuronal dysfunction and microglial contribution have been studied in this context, only recently the role of astrocytes in early-life programming of the brain has been appreciated. Astrocytes serve many basic roles for brain functioning (e.g., synaptogenesis, glutamate recycling), and are unique in their capacity of sensing and integrating environmental signals, as they are the first cells to encounter signals from the blood, including hormonal changes (e.g., glucocorticoids), immune signals, and nutritional information. Integration of these signals is especially important during early development, and therefore we propose that astrocytes contribute to ELA induced changes in the brain by sensing and integrating environmental signals and by modulating neuronal development and function. Studies in rodents have already shown that ELA can impact astrocytes on the short and long term, however, a critical review of these results is currently lacking. Here, we will discuss the developmental trajectory of astrocytes, their ability to integrate stress, immune, and nutritional signals from the early environment, and we will review how different types of early adversity impact astrocytes.
2943222712	Rhizoctonia solani AG1-IA is a soil-borne necrotrophic pathogen that causes devastating rice sheath blight disease in rice-growing regions worldwide. Sclerotia play an important role in the life cycle of R. solani AG1-IA. In this study, RNA sequencing was used to investigate the transcriptomic dynamics of sclerotial development (SD) of R. solani AG1-IA. Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses using the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) were performed to investigate the functions and pathways of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Six cDNA libraries were generated, and more than 300 million clean reads were obtained and assembled into 15,100 unigenes. In total, 12,575 differentially expressed genes were identified and 34.62% (4353) were significantly differentially expressed with a FDR ≤ 0.01 and |log2Ratio| ≥ 1, which were enriched into eight profiles using Short Time-series Expression Miner. Furthermore, KEGG and gene ontology analyses suggest the DEGs were significantly enriched in several biological processes and pathways, including binding and catalytic functions, biosynthesis of ribosomes, and other biological functions. Further annotation of the DEGs using the Clusters of Orthologous Groups (COG) database found most DEGs were involved in amino acid transport and metabolism, as well as energy production and conversion. Furthermore, DEGs relevant to SD of R. solani AG1-IA were involved in secondary metabolite biosynthesis, melanin biosynthesis, ubiquitin processes, autophagy, and reactive oxygen species metabolism. The gene expression profiles of 10 randomly selected DEGs were validated by quantitative real-time reverse transcription PCR and were consistent with the dynamics in transcript abundance identified by RNA sequencing. The data provide a high-resolution map of gene expression during SD, a key process contributing to the pathogenicity of this devastating pathogen. In addition, this study provides a useful resource for further studies on the genomics of R. solani AG1-IA and other Rhizoctonia species.

3149575047	Ocular cicatricial pemphigoid (OCP) is an autoimmunediseasethataffectsmainlyconjunctivaandother squamous epithelia. OCP is histologically characterized by a separation of the epithelium from underlying tissues within the basement membrane zone. Immunopathological studies demonstrate the deposition of anti-basement membrane zone autoantibodiesinvivo.PurifiedIgGfromseraofpatientswith active OCP identified a cDNA clone from a human keratino- cyte cDNA library that had complete homology with the cytoplasmic domain of b4-integrin. The sera recognized a 205-kDa protein in human epidermal, human conjunctiva, andtumorcelllysatesthatwasidentifiedas b4-integrinbyits reactionwithpolyclonalandmonoclonalantibodiestohuman b4-integrin. Sera from patients with bullous pemphigoid, pemphigus vulgaris, and cicatricial pemphigoid-like diseases did not recognize the 205-kDa protein, indicating the speci- ficity of the binding. These data strongly implicate a role for human b4-integrin in the pathogenesis of OCP. It should be emphasizedthatmultipleantigensinthebasementmembrane zone of squamous epithelia may serve as targets for a wide spectrum of autoantibodies observed in vesiculobullous dis- eases. Molecular definition of these autoantigens will facili- tate the classification and characterization of subsets of cicatricial pemphigoid and help distinguishing them from bullous pemphigoid. This study highlights the function and importance of b4-integrin in maintaining the attachment of epithelial cells to the basement membrane.
2055247982	Groups of female mice were starved or exposed to hypobaric hypoxia during pregnancy. A significantly lower weight gain during pregnancy occurred in the mothers starved or exposed to hypoxia compared to controls. Hypoxia also decreased maternal food intake. Therefore, the hypoxic groups included a combination of hypoxia and starvation. Body weight, brain weight, brain DNA (deoxyribonucleic aid) and total protein were investigated in the offspring at birth and at 20 and 70 days of age. Starvation and hypoxia impaired fetal growth, with reduction in body weight, brain weight, brain cell number (DNA content) and brain total protein content in a dose-related manner. In the most severely starved fetuses brain cell size (brain weight/DNA and total protein/DNA) was also reduced. Long-term effects were observed with lower body weight, brain weight and brain DNA content at adult age in the most severely malnourished and hypoxic offspring. Catch-up growth took place after a more moderate starvation and hypoxic exposure. It is concluded that intrauterine malnutrition interferes with fetal cellular mitotic rate. This may give rise to growth-retarded fetuses because of a decreased cell number. Depending o the degree of malnutrition a cell deficit may persist at adult age. Intrauterine hypoxia may aggravate these effects of fetal starvation.
2055248020	"mong the concerns associated with the ""release"" of transgenic plants into the environment is the possibility that genes transformed into a crop plant by recombinant DNA methods could spread into its wild relatives. The process of concern is introgression, the transfer of genes from one population into another via hybridization and subsequent backcrossing. If these genes confer some selective advantage on the wild relatives, then they could contribute to the development of new or more troublesome weedy forms. For example, genes for disease, drought, and herbicide resistance could all produce problems by enhancing the fitness of the wild relatives. The available evidence for gene flow between crops and their relatives provides a context for beginning to make realistic assessments of the risk"
2055248030	Chronic activation of microglia, the macrophages of the CNS, has been shown to enhance neuronal damage because of excessive release of proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic molecules in a number of neurodegenerative diseases. Recent reports showed altered microRNA (miRNA) expression in immune-mediated pathologies, thus suggesting that miRNAs modulate expression of genes involving immune responses. This study demonstrates that miRNA-200b is expressed in microglia and modulates inflammatory response of microglia by regulating mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. miRNA-200b expression was found to be down-regulated in activated microglia in vivo (traumatic brain injury rat model) and in vitro. A luciferase assay and loss- and gain-of-function studies revealed c-Jun, the transcription factor of cJun-N terminal kinase (JNK) mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway to be the target of miR-200b. Knockdown of miR-200b in microglia increased JNK activity along with an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression and nitric oxide (NO) production. Conversely, over-expression of miRNA-200b in microglia resulted in a decrease in JNK activity, inducible nitric oxide synthase expression, NO production and migratory potential of activated microglia. Furthermore, miR-200b inhibition resulted in increased neuronal apoptosis after treatment of neuronal cells with conditioned medium obtained from microglial culture. Taken together, these results indicate that miRNA-200b modulates microglial inflammatory process including cytokine secretion, NO production, migration and neuronal survival.

2055248078	Serotoninergic and noradrenergic drugs have been shown to initiate and/or modulate locomotion in cats after spinal cord transection and in patients suffering from spinal cord injuries. To establish a firmer basis for locomotor pharmacotherapy, the distribution of alpha1- and alpha2-noradrenergic and serotonin1A (5-HT1A) receptors was examined in the spinal cord of control cats and of from animals with spinal cord transection at T13 some weeks or months previously. In control cats, the highest levels of alpha1-noradrenergic receptors, labeled with [3H]prazosin, were found in laminae II, IX, and X. The alpha2-noradrenergic receptors, labeled with [3H]idazoxan, were found mainly in laminae II, III, and X, with moderate densities in lamina IX. After spinal transection, both receptors did not change in segments above the lesion. At 15 and 30 days after spinal transection, binding significantly increased in laminae II, III, IV, and X for alpha2 and in laminae I, II, III, and IX for alpha1 receptors in lumbar segments. For longer survival times, binding densities returned to near control values. The 5-HT1A receptors, labeled with [3H] 8-hydroxy-dipropylaminotetralin, were found mainly in laminae I-IV and X. After spinal transection, binding significantly increased only in laminae II, III, and X of lumbar segments at 15 and 30 days. Thereafter, binding returned to control values. The pronounced upregulation of different monoaminergic receptors observed in the lumbar region in the first month after spinal transection suggests that these receptors may be important during the period when cats normally recover functions such as locomotion of the hindlimbs.
2055248152	Different developmental stages (from eggs to 1-year-old juveniles) of the teleost fish Dicentrarchus labrax (L.) were assayed for CD4 gene expression. RT-PCR revealed the appearance of CD4 transcripts in post-larvae from 51 days post-hatching (dph). This finding overlaps the first detection of CD8-α mRNA.  Real-time PCR with specific primers quantified CD4, CD8-α and TCR-β transcripts in larvae and post-larvae (25, 51, 75 and 92 dph) and 1-year-old thymus. At 92 dph, TcR-β and CD8-α transcripts were significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in previous stages, as CD4 transcripts compared with 51 dph (P < 0.01). High levels of TCR-β and CD8-α transcripts were found in the thymus, while CD4 transcripts were lower (P < 0.05 vs. TCR-β).  In situ hybridization identified CD4 mRNAs at 51 dph, localized in thymocytes of the outer and lateral zones of the thymic glands. From 75 dph on the signal was mainly detected in the outer region, drawing a cortex–medulla demarcation. Developmental expression of CD4 and CD8-α almost coincided. In each adult thymic lobe CD4+ and CD8-α+ thymocytes filled the cortex. The expression patterns of CD4 and CD8-α largely overlap, except in the medulla, where CD4+ thymocytes were isolated, while CD8-α+ ones mainly arranged in cords.  These results provide new information about the thymic compartmentalization and lymphocyte differentiation pathways in a teleost, almost demonstrating that double negative thymocytes fill the cortex giving rise to further selection in the medulla.
2055248166	The effect of topical radiation on heterotopically transplanted cardiac allografts has been investigated in dogs. Seventy-three transplants were done in this series, with 10 animals serving as controls, and the remaining 63 receiving 2400-rad radiation to the graft in 6 equal doses, over a period of 3 weeks. Seventy-five per cent of the radiated grafts maintained viability for periods up to 10 weeks, while 90% of the nonradiated transplants were rejected by the 12th postoperative day. In addition, 12 intact canine hearts radiated with identical dose and fractionation provided histological controls for the radiated transplanted group. Electrocardiographic changes and alteration in lactic dehydrogenase values proved to be the most sensitive parameters of early rejection.

2055248190	Zusammenfassung  Flohkafer (Podagrica spp.) und der sudanesische Baumwollkapselwurm (Diparopsis watersi) treten zur Zeit als Grosschadlinge der in den Nuba-Bergen im Sudan angebauten kurzfaserigen Regenbaumwolle auf. Rotwanzen (Dysdercus spp.) spielen im Gegensatz zu fruher infolge erfolgreicher Bekampfung am Affenbrotbaum keine wesentliche Rolle mehr. Die Flohkafer, von denen in den Nuba-Bergen mindestens zwei Arten an Baumwolle vorkommen, schadigen in erster Linie durch Vernichtung frisch aufgelaufener Samlinge in fruh gesaten Feldern, wahrend die Raupen von D. watersi wahrend der ganzen Vegetationsperiode, vor allem aber nach der Regenzeit, Blutenknospen, Bluten und Kapseln zerstoren.    Zwei Saatgutinkrustierungsversuche gegen Podagrica spp. ergaben eine sehr gute Wirkung von Aldrin bei einer Aufwandmenge von 4 g Wirkstoff pro Kilogramm Baumwollsaatgut. Dieldrin lieferte nur in einem Versuch ein gleichwertiges Ergebnis. Alle anderen gepruften Praparate, samtlich Karbamate, zeigten nur eine verhaltnismasig geringe oder praktisch keine Wirkung.    In Spritzversuchen gegen D. watersi wurden vor allem mit Hilfe der Karbamate Sevin, Bayer 5024a und Bayer 5080a gute Erfolge bei 3–4, in Abstanden von 10–12 Tagen vorgenommenen Behandlungen erzielt. Von den gepruften Phosphorinsektiziden lieferten Gusathion A und Folithion die besten Ergebnisse. Dagegen fielen die chlorierten Kohlenwasserstoffe, vor allem das DDT, mehr oder weniger stark ab.    Summary  Flea beetles (Podagrica spp.) and Sudan bollworm (Diparopsis watersi) are the most serious pests of rain-grown cotton in the Nuba Mountains, Sudan. The importance of stainer bugs (Dysdercus spp.) decreased rapidly since spraying of baobab trees (Adansonia digitata) is practized. There are at least two species of flea beetles in the Nuba Mountains which cause heavy damage by destroying of seedlings in early sown fields. The larvae of Sudan boll-worm are responsible for shedding of flower buds, flowers, and capsules which takes place especially after the rains in October and November.    Aldrin was very effective against Podagrica spp. in two seed dressing experiments at a rate of 4 grammes of active ingredient per kilogramme of seed. Dieldrin was equally satisfactory only in one trial. All other tested chemicals did not show much promise.    The carbamates sevin, Bayer 5024a, and Bayer 5080a which were sprayed 3–4 times in intervals of 10–12 days against D. watersi proved to be very effective. Among the tested organic phosphoric acids, gusathion A and folithion gave promising results. Contrary, the clorinated hydrocarbons, especially D.D.T., were less effective.
2055248228	The ability of naive T cells to clonally expand and acquire effector functions depends on the strength of signals received by the T-cell receptor (TCR) and by an array of co-stimulatory receptors — the most prominent of which is CD28. In this review, we discuss recent genetic, biochemical and biophysical data that indicate a modified view of the molecular mechanism by which ligation of CD28 amplifies TCR-mediated T-cell activation. These studies indicate that the commonly held notion of a qualitative signalling role of CD28 in T-cell activation should be revised.
2055248245	Water deficits during pollination increase the frequency of zygotic abortion in maize (Zea mays L.). Recent work suggests that reproductive failure occurs because assimilate supply in water-deficient plants is not sufficient to maintain growth of all newly formed zygotes. We tested this possibility by altering the vegetative source to reproductive sink ratio in the inbred line A188 prior to imposing a water deficit at pollination. Relative assimilate supply was modified by growing plants in 20-L pots containing 22 kg of amended soil in three environments: (i) the field, (ii) the field under 55% shade, or (iii) a growth chamber. Sink size was modified genetically using a chromosome interchange (reciprocal translocation) mutant (T3-7c) that is near-isogenic to the wild type (A188WT) but sets only 50% of the fertilized ovaries. Six treatment-genotype combinations produced a seven-fold range in photosynthesis per kernel and a four-fold range in reserve sugars per kernel at silk emergence. Water was withheld on the first day silks emerged and plants were hand pollinated 4 to 7 d later when leaf photosynthesis was <2 μmol m −2 s −1 and silk water potential (Ψ w ) reached −1.1 MPa. Upon rehydration 2 d after pollination (DAP), leaf Ψ w and photosynthesis rapidly recovered to control values. The water deficit decreased kernel number per ear 40 to 70% compared to the controls. Plants with a high source/sink ratio (e.g., T3-7c, field) were just as sensitive to low Ψ w at pollination as plants with a low source/ sink ratio (e.g., A188WT, growth chamber). These results indicate that assimilate supply per kernel alone does not determine the sensitivity of kernel set to low Ψ w at pollination
2055248252	tion of microbes [2] . As a matter of fact, in the 20th century, some giant viruses were considered for a long time to be bacteria or parasites because the size factor biased their initial viral classification. Indeed, the established definition of a virus during the 20th century considered that all viruses should have at least one dimension of less than 0.2 μm [2, 7] . Giant viruses pose a problem to traditional virology techniques because purification techniques prior to virome study involve a filtration that removes giant viruses [12–14] . We were recently able to show that, when avoiding 0.2-μm filtration, giant viruses belonging to the Marseillevirus family could be found circulating in the blood of asymptomatic patients [13, 14] . In addition, for now, PCR techniques have unfortunately demonstrated little sensitivity because, due to the high variability of these viruses, tools were lacking to identify them [2, 15] . Culture techniques have indeed enabled the isolation of these viruses for the first time in human stool samples, with a reference reported in this paper [16] . New strategies for culture, purification [17] and isolation techniques [16] are reported in the present issue. Also, for the first time, these techniques have enabled the isolation of Mimivirus from a respiratory sample [18, 19] and the stools of a patient with pneumonia [20] . However, it is likely that serology is more effective in the detection of specific antibodies against the Marseilleviridae family, as related in Gilbert Greub’s work in this journal [21] . These data confirm that both Mimiviridae and Marseilleviridae may be found in humans [19] . Mimivirus The world of giant viruses was brutally opened up at the beginning of the 21st century when a microorganism visible under the microscope, Gram stained, and which had been considered a bacterium for several years, was identified as the largest virus known at the time: it was Mimivirus [1, 2] . Its genome contained more than 1,200 genes and had the particularity, given the wealth of information it contained, to harbor genes common to bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes [3] . To me, this particular feature was the most striking, and I postulated immediately for the publication of the genome, believing that this virus might be representative of a fourth domain [3] . This caused various reactions, in spite of a subsequent classification into four branches using genes encoding for RNA polymerase showing four groups: giant viruses, archaea, bacteria and eukaryotes [4, 5] . For a while, I was the only one to believe in the existence of a fourth domain, which was challenged both by Jean-Michel Claverie and C.E. Woese [6] . We proposed later, based on these data, to create a new classification splitting organisms into capsidencoding organisms and ribosome-encoding organisms [7] . In this issue, the specificity of codon and amino acid use of this group of viruses is reported [8] . Since then, we have reported the existence of a new family of viruses, Marseilleviridae [9] , the first strain being Marseillevirus [10] . The recent discovery of a new giant virus, considered to be an intracellular eukaryotic parasite for 15 years [11] , shows that the world of giant viruses keeps expanding and challenges the traditional classificaPublished online: October 17, 2013
2055248302	Immunization of mice with the idiotype (Id) immunoglobulin from the murine B cell lymphoma, BCL1, before inoculating tumor cells can induce tumor dormancy. In this model, the tumor cells grow for a short period of time and then regress. The mice live for months or years with approximately 1 million tumor cells in their spleens. Some mice relapse due to decreases in the anti-Id antibody titers or the development of mutations in the residual tumor cells which render them refractory to negative signaling by the anti-Id antibody. In this study we determined whether we could eliminate the residual dormant cells by using a DNA vaccine against the Id or by immunomodulation of T-cell subsets in vivo. Our results demonstrate that dormancy can be maintained by further immunizations with either the BCL1 Id protein or DNA vaccine encoding its single-chain Fv fragment. We also found that a cytotoxic T-cell response was not induced by either in vivo administration of vaccine alone or by the vaccine plus interleukin-2. In addition the injection of anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associate antigen did not prolong dormancy. Finally, the in vivo administration of anti-CD25 to deplete regulatory T cells did not prolong dormancy. Dormancy in this model is dependent primarily upon anti-Id antibodies, our results suggest that other strategies to target residual dormant BCL1 cells are warranted. They also suggest that the elimination of dormant tumor may represent a greater challenge than the elimination of primary tumors.
2240763910	Abstract not available for EP0705336Abstract of corresponding document: WO9428128Polycystic ovary (PCO) syndrome has been discovered to have an underlying genetic cause; further, in males the phenotype of the disorder has been found to be male pattern baldness (MPB). A mutation in the CYP17 gene, which encodes the enzyme P450c17, demonstrates an association with the phenotype: the mutation is a replacement of a T by a C within the 5' transcribed region of the gene. Recombinant DNA systems for modelling, diagnosing and treating the disease are based on these findings.

That the lives of your grandparents — the air they breathed, the food they ate, even the things they saw — can directly affect you, decades later, despite your never experiencing these things yourself.” BBC, Ghost in Your Genes.
2240764259	To develop a promising alkylating agents for anti-cervical cancer chemotherapy, five mitosene analogues were synthesized. Despite the potentiality of better cytotoxicity on solid tumor cells as opposed to that on rapidly-doubled leukemic cells, there have been no reports on the inhibition of the cervical cancer cell line by mitosene analogues. The present experiment was designed to investigate whether mitosene analogues can effectively inhibit the cellular proliferation of cervical cancer cells by using an in vitro chemosensitivty system. The mitosene analogues displayed a potent cytotoxic effect on the tested cervical cancer cell lines. Among the analogues, (22) compound gave the best inhibitory effect on SiHa tumor colonies formation. These data indicate that mitosene analogues can effectively inhibit the growth of cervical cancer cells in vitro.

2943223099	Investigating space allocation patterns of plant secondary xylem along a latitudinal gradient is useful to evaluate structure-function tradeoffs in woody angiosperm xylem. An anatomical dataset including 700 woody angiosperm species across China was compiled together with latitudinal and climate data for each species. The relative tissue fractions of vessels, fibers, and parenchyma (including ray and axial parenchyma) in xylem were analyzed to determine the effect of latitudinal differences and phylogeny on anatomical variation. The analyses revealed a trade-off between vessel and non-vessel fraction across latitude, with tissue fraction trade-offs mainly occurring between vessels and fibers, and between fibers and total parenchyma. Among 13 climate variables, thermal indices generally had greater explanatory power than moisture indices in bi-variate models for all cell types, while mean annual temperature, mean temperature of the coldest month, and annual actual evapotranspiration were included in the top multi-variate models explaining variance of different tissue fractions. Phylogeny and climate together explained 57 to 73% of the total variation in xylem space occupancy, with phylogeny alone accounting for over 50% of the variation. These results contribute to our knowledge of wood structure-function and are relevant to better understand forest response to climate change.
2943223175	Microbiomes from every environment contain a myriad of uncultivated archaeal and bacterial viruses, but studying these viruses is hampered by the lack of a universal, scalable taxonomic framework. We present vConTACT v.2.0, a network-based application utilizing whole genome gene-sharing profiles for virus taxonomy that integrates distance-based hierarchical clustering and confidence scores for all taxonomic predictions. We report near-identical (96%) replication of existing genus-level viral taxonomy assignments from the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses for National Center for Biotechnology Information virus RefSeq. Application of vConTACT v.2.0 to 1,364 previously unclassified viruses deposited in virus RefSeq as reference genomes produced automatic, high-confidence genus assignments for 820 of the 1,364. We applied vConTACT v.2.0 to analyze 15,280 Global Ocean Virome genome fragments and were able to provide taxonomic assignments for 31% of these data, which shows that our algorithm is scalable to very large metagenomic datasets. Our taxonomy tool can be automated and applied to metagenomes from any environment for virus classification.
2943223192	Although immunohistochemistry (IHC) has been known and applied for decades, major advances such as robotic sample processing, digital slide image capture, and innovative computerized data analysis uphold the relevance of the technology in current laboratory practice. In keeping with this notion, the expression of a protein by a given tissue or cell can be readily defined using methods like immunoblotting or mass spectrometry. However, when it comes to assessing the microenvironmental location and potential cellular connections, only IHC can provide the pathophysiological spatial context. Thus, IHC enables the selective localization and visualization of protein antigens in tissue sections by means of antigen-specific antibodies that are conjugated to selective fluorescent or enzymatic tags, which can be readily revealed by fluorescence microscopy or chemically pigmented reactions. Since IHC relies on the highly specific antigen and antibody interactions, the technology can be used to identify cell or tissue antigens that range from amino acids and proteins to infectious agents and specific cellular populations and their relevant functional properties, thus underscoring its critical application as a key research/diagnostic tool for investigators studying animal or human tissues. With well-developed tests and controls, correct procedure, and equipment, IHC can be used to analyze a wide variety of cell and tissue structures, processes, and functions, such as cell cycle analysis and tissue protein binding in health and disease. Notably, these applications were previously inaccessible by traditional histochemistry staining techniques, which only identified a limited number of proteins and tissue structures. In the past, this process was semiquantitative at best, but new advances are making it possible to obtain quantitative results using IHC. The present chapter reviews the history and applications of IHC, basic principles, techniques, troubleshooting, analysis, and data interpretation. This chapter will further cover the latest innovations in IHC slide preparation and labeling for advanced diagnostic and prognostic applications, such as CyTOF and laser capture microdissection, which allows high-throughput quantitative methods of proteomics, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), and genomics on selective cells and tissue regions.
2943223428	Purpose N6-methyladenosine (m6A), the most abundant mRNA modification in mammals, is involved in various biological processes. KIAA1429 is an important methyltransferase participating in m6A modification. However, the role of KIAA1429 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still not well understood. Here, we aimed to investigate the function of KIAA1429 and its corresponding regulation mechanisms in HCC. Patients and methods HCC-related genes were analyzed by clinical and expression data of HCC patients in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Expression of KIAA1429 was verified by quantitative reverse-transcription PCR, and interference efficiency was obtained using small interfering RNA (siRNA). Cell proliferation, migration, and invasion were assessed by cell counting kit-8 and transwell assays, and the m6A modification was detected by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation-PCR (MeRIP-PCR). Results We found a difference in the expression of KIAA1429 between HCC and normal hepatic tissues by analyzing data from the TCGA database. Comparing HCC cell lines (HepG2, Huh-7, HepG2.2.15) with normal hepatic cells (HL-7702), we observed an identically significant difference in KIAA1429 expression. KIAA1429 significantly enhanced proliferation, migration, and invasion of HepG2 cells. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes functional enrichment analysis and correlation analysis revealed a significant negative correlation between KIAA1429 and ID2. In the subsequent MeRIP-PCR assay, downregulation of KIAA1429 inhibited m6A modification of ID2 mRNA. Conclusion KIAA1429 facilitated migration and invasion of HCC by inhibiting ID2 via upregulating m6A modification of ID2 mRNA.
2943223544	Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus is one of the most economically important freshwater fish cultivated worldwide. Despite its importance and being one of the cichlid fish most studied from a parasitological point of view in Mexico, there are few studies about the ectoparasite protozoa that infect them. In this study, a total of 240 juvenile individuals of O. niloticus from an experimental culture (in Tabasco, Mexico) were examined to detect the presence of trichodinid parasites. Trichodinid parasites were impregnated with silver nitrate and stained with Harris´ hematoxylin solution for taxonomic evaluation. A disc-shaped trichodinid with a body diameter of 38 ± 3.3 μm adhesive disc diameter of 34 ± 3.3 μm and a denticulate ring diameter of 19 ± 2.1 μm was found. Trichodina centrostrigeata has been previously reported having specificity for cypriniform species, but in the present study, the Nile tilapia was reported as a new fish host and southeastern Mexico as a new geographical distribution for this parasite.
2240765096	This review covers the molecular characterization of starch biosynthetic genes by the Starch group based in CSIRO, Canberra which benefitted enormously from the interactions with Prof Mukai and his group in Osaka. A number of genes involved in starch biosynthesis in wheat were isolated from the D- genome donor of wheat, Aegilops tauschii. These were usually isolated as lambda clones and therefore their location on chromosomes could only be determined with further work. This gap was filled by the cytogenetic work carried out by Prof Mukai’s group. In addition, when larger BAC clones were isolated, it was often possible by cytogenetics to visualize the organization of multiple genes and to confirm and sometimes correct conclusions from sequencing. New planned work in starch and lipid accumulation at Monash Malaysia is briefly mentioned.
2240765188	Hypoxia-inducible factor–2α (HIF-2α) is highly expressed in embryonic vascular endothelial cells (ECs) and activates the expression of target genes whose products modulate vascular function and angiogenesis. In this report, we describe a genetic model designed to test the physiologic consequences of deleting HIF-2α in murine endothelial cells. Surprisingly, mice with HIF-2α–deficient ECs developed normally but displayed a variety of phenotypes, including increased vessel permeability, aberrant endothelial cell ultrastructure, and pulmonary hypertension. Moreover, these animals exhibited defective tumor angiogenesis associated with increased hypoxic stress and tumor cell apoptosis. Immortalized HIF-2α–deficient ECs displayed decreased adhesion to extracellular matrix proteins and expressed reduced levels of transcripts encoding fibronectin, integrins, endothelin B receptor, angiopoietin 2, and delta-like ligand 4 (Dll4). Together, these data identify unique cell-autonomous functions for HIF-2α in vascular endothelial cells.
3149575628	The dynamics of competing populations are investigated using discrete non-linear models with age structure. Necessary and sufficient stability conditions for the coexistence equililbrium between two competing non-interbreeding species are developed. An extension of this result shows that coexistence, which is not necessarily stable, occurs in terms of a simple geometric rule on a two dimensional phase plane, provided that each species reaches a stable equilibrium state in the absence of the other species. In the interbreeding case, analytical results are derived for a one locus, two allele model. Sufficient conditions for the stability of polymorphic equilibria are obtained. It is also shown that if both the homozygous genotypes have stable equilibria at fixation, then genetic coexistence occurs when the equilibrium heterozygous zygote production rate is overdominant. Harvesting can lead to the extinction of one of a pair of competing species, or to loss of genetic diversity in a panmictic population. When catchability increases sufliciently with body size, then harvesting preferentially removes the most productive genotypes, and this causes a reduction in the maximum sustainable yield of the population. Harvesting can also reverse the relative fitness of genotypes, since a rare inferior genotype in an unexploited population may be more lit under fishing. \c 1989 ,
2943224177	The majority of ecotoxicological studies performed measure average responses from individuals which do not account for the inter-individual variation in the responses of animals to environmental stimuli (i.e. the personality of individuals). Thus, these designs assume that all individuals will respond to contaminant exposure in a similar manner. Additionally, commonly used constant, static exposure regime designs neglect to recognize the spatial and temporal variation in contaminant plume structures as they move throughout fluid environments. The purpose of this study was to understand the effects of the structural characteristics (concentration, duration, and frequency) of temporally and spatially variant contaminant plumes on the personality of individuals. This experimental design aimed to construct a sensitive definition of exposure by connecting sublethal effects of toxicants and realistic exposure regimes. This study used escape response of Faxonius virilis crayfish from the predatory odor of Micropterus salmoides prior to and following exposure to the herbicide, atrazine. Atrazine was delivered in pulses to flow through exposure arenas for a total of 47 h while manipulating the concentration, frequency, and duration of the herbicide pulses. Escape response of crayfish prior to exposure was used to categorize animals into bold and shy personalities. The change in escape response was analyzed and resulted in a personality-dependent behavioral sensitivity to the polluted environment. Individuals classified as bold showed increased change in response to predatory odor relative to shy animals. Bold animals exhibited decreased activity after exposure where no change was presented in shy individuals. Shifts in individual behavior have impacts on the population level (e.g. resource acquisition/value; interspecies competition) and the ecosystem level (e.g. food web dynamics; trophic cascades). This study demonstrates the importance of sensitive measures in ecological risk assessment methods.

2055248491	In response to double stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) in fish activates signaling like human, and induces innate immunity. This suggested the existence of dsRNA binding domains in fish TLR3 as reported in higher vertebrates. In in silico analysis, leucine rich repeat (LRR) regions (4-6, 13-14, 20-22), and LRR (8-15, 17-24) were identified as key domains in rohu TLR3 as poly I:C and dsRNA of fish reovirus (AGCRV,VHSV and IHNV) binding regions. 3D-models of rohu TLR3-TIR and zebrafish TRIF were generated by homology and ab initio modeling respectively, and their interacting domains were predicted. This is the first report of TLR3 modeling in fish.
2055248514	In most species, each sex produces gametes, usually either sperm or oocytes, from its germline during gametogenesis. The sperm and oocyte subsequently fuse together during fertilization to create the next generation. This review focuses on spermatogenesis and the roles of sperm during fertilization in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where suitable mutants are readily obtained. So far, 186 mutants defective in the C. elegans male germline functions have been isolated, and many of these mutations are alleles for one of the approximately 60 spermatogenesis-defective (spe) genes. Many cloned spe genes are expressed specifically in the male germline, where they play roles during spermatogenesis (spermatid production), spermiogenesis (spermatid activation into spermatozoa), and/or fertilization. Moreover, several spe genes are orthologs of mammalian genes, suggesting that the reproductive processes of the C. elegans and the mammalian male germlines might share common pathways at the molecular level.
2055248587	To study the role of the lumenal binding protein (BiP) in the transport and secretion of proteins, we have produced plants with altered BiP levels. Transgenic plants overexpressing BiP showed dramatically increased BiP mRNA levels but only a modest increase in BiP protein levels. The presence of degradation products in BiP overproducers suggests a regulatory mechanism that increases protein turnover when BiP is abundant. Antisense inhibition of BiP synthesis was not successful, demonstrating that even a minor reduction in the basal BiP level is deleterious to cell viability. Overexpression of BiP leads to downregulation of the basal transcript levels of endogenous BiP genes and greatly reduces the unfolded protein response. The data confirm that BiP transcription is regulated via a feedback mechanism that involves monitoring of BiP protein levels. To test BiP activity in vivo, we designed a functional assay, using the secretory protein α-amylase and a cytosolic enzyme as a control for cell viability. During tunicamycin treatment, an overall reduction of α-amylase synthesis was observed when compared with the cytosolic marker. We show that the tunicamycin effect is due to the depletion of BiP in the endoplasmic reticulum because coexpressed BiP alone is able to restore efficient α-amylase synthesis. This is a novel assay to monitor BiP activity in promoting secretory protein synthesis in vivo.
2055248589	The adaptation of growth in response to nutritional changes is essential for the proper development of all organisms. Here we describe the identification of the Drosophila homolog of the target of rapamycin (TOR), a candidate effector for nutritional sensing. Genetic and biochemical analyses indicate that dTOR impinges on the insulin signaling pathway by autonomously affecting growth through modulating the activity of dS6K. However, in contrast to other components in the insulin signaling pathway, partial loss of dTOR function preferentially reduces growth of the endoreplicating tissues. These results are consistent with dTOR residing on a parallel amino acid sensing pathway.
2055248690	Our analyses of three human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) and six human embryonic stem cell (hESC) lines showed marked variability in differentiation potential into specific lineages, which often hampers their differentiation into specific cell types or cell lineages of interest. Simultaneous inhibition of both Activin/Nodal and BMP pathways with small molecules, SB431542 and dorsomorphin (DM), respectively, promoted significant neural differentiation from all human pluripotent stem cell (hPSC) lines tested, regardless of their differentiation propensity. On the contrary, differentiation into other cell lineages and the number of undifferentiated cells were significantly reduced after differentiation by the dual inhibition. These results demonstrate that innate differentiation propensity of hPSCs could be overcome, at least in part, by modulation of intracellular signaling pathways, resulting in efficient generation of desirable cell types, such as neural cells.
2055248710	The extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway is a major determinant in the control of diverse cellular processes such as proliferation, survival, and motility. This pathway is often upregulated in human cancers and as such represents an attractive target for mechanism-based approaches to cancer treatment. However, specific blockade of the ERK pathway alone induces mostly cytostatic rather than proapoptotic effects, resulting in limited therapeutic efficacy. Blockade of the constitutively activated ERK pathway by an ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitor sensitizes tumor cells to apoptotic cell death induced by several cytotoxic anticancer agents including microtubule-destabilizing agents and histone deacetylase inhibitors, not only in vitro but also in tumor zenografts in vivo. Thus, low concentrations of these anticancer drugs that by themselves show little cytotoxicity effectively kill tumor cells in which the ERK pathway is constitutively activated when co-administrated with a MEK inhibitor. The combination of a cytostatic signaling pathway inhibitor (MEK inhibitors) and conventional anticancer drugs (microtubule-destabilizing agents or histone deacetylase inhibitors) provides an excellent basis for the development of safer anticancer chemotherapies with enhanced efficacy through lowering the required dose of the latter cytotoxic drugs.
2055248736	THE ASTER-YELLOWS VIRUS alternates in nature between plant and insect vector hosts. The multiplication of the virus in these two hosts has been demonstrated experimentally and it therefore seems justified to use the term incubation period in preference to latent period or delay of infectivity. The term incubation period in the plant is used in this paper to describe the period between inoculation of a susceptible host and the appearance of first disease symptoms. During this interval the small amount of virus introduced into a plant by a feeding insect, moves, multiplies, and becomes systemic. The incubation period in the insect is defined as the time between acquisition of virus by an insect vector and the time the insect becomes infective. The incubation period in insects is comparable to that in the plant. During this interval the small amount of virus initially acquired spreads in the insect body, multiplies, and produces a systemic infection. The influence of several factors on the incubation period of aster-yellows virus was studied in plants and in the aster leafhopper, Macrosteles fascifrons Stal2 (Beirne, 1952), earlier known as Macrosteles divisus Uhler (1937 to 1952) and Cicadula sexnotata (Fall.) (until 1937). Several other incidental problems that arose were investigated: the movement of virus from point of inoculation in the plant; the inability of insects to acquire virus during the first 7 days of incubation period in plants; the influence of temperature on the ability to acquire virus by feeding insects and the transmission by infective insects. LITERATURE.-SO far the aster-yellows virus has not been transmitted mechanically to plants. In 1924, Kunkel discovered that the virus is transmitted by the leafhopper, Macrosteles fascifrons Stal. The relationship of the virus to the insect vec. tor and to various host plants was comprehensively studied by Kunkel (1924, 1926a, 1926b, 1928, 1929, 1930, 1931, 1932, 1937a, 1937b, 1938, 1941, 1951). In 1940, Black succeeded in the mechanical inoculation of virus-free aster leafhoppers by means of injections of juices from infective insects. This is the only method presently available for studying the virus in vitro. The evidence for multiplication of the virus in M. fascifrons was derived from various experiments and in a variety of ways (Kunkel, 1937a, 1938; Black, 1941; Maramorosch, 1950b, 1952a, 1952b) . In 1937, Kunkel discovered the heat-induced incubation period and the inactivation of the virus at 32?C. (1937a). A study of the influence of lower temperatures and of incubation periods under controlled environmental conditions,
2055248738	Phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C (PI-PLC) treatment of the human natural killer (NK) target cells Molt-4, Jurkat, and U937 reduced their susceptibility to killing by human NK cells in a dose-dependent fashion. This indicates that a cell surface Structure, anchored by a glycosyl-Phosphatidylinositol (G-P1) moiety, is important in NK cytotoxicity. In contrast, another common NK target cell line, K562, remained susceptible to NK killing after enzyme treatment, suggesting that distinct target structures are expressed by this cell line. PI-PLC treatment of Molt-4 cells also reduced their sensitivity to human lymphokine activated killer (LAK) cells, suggesting that NK and LAK cells share common specificity in the killing of Molt-4. In contrast, PI-PLC had no effect on the killing of the LAK target cell line. Daudi, which is only weakly sensitive to unactivated NK cells. Killing of a variety of murine target cells by murine NK cells was not affected by PI-PLC treatment, but cross-species killing of Molt-4 by murine NK cells was inhibited by PI-PLC, suggesting a common mechanism in the killing of this human target cell line. The PI-PLC treatment of effector cells from either species did not reduce their NK activity. The reduction in sensitivity of the Molt-4, Jurkat, and U937 target cells probably results from a loss of a target specific G-PI linked membrane molecule, but other possible explanations for these results are also discussed.
2055248769	Whether or not behavior accurately reflects evolutionary relationships (phylogeny) has been hotly debated by ethologists and comparative psychologists. Previous studies attempting to resolve this question have generally lacked a quantitative, phylogenetic approach. In this study we used behavior and life-history (BLH) information (72 characters) to generate phylogenetic trees for 18 seabird species (albatrosses, petrels, and penguins). We compared these trees with trees obtained from isozyme electrophoretic analysis of blood proteins (15 loci and 98 electromorphs) and partial mitochondrial 12S ribosomal DNA sequences (381 base pairs). Cladistic analysis of the BLH data set generated three MP trees (tree length = 243, CI = 0.52, RI = 0.57) with significant cladistic structure. The BLH characters were classified into four types (foraging, agonistic, reproductive, and life history) and levels of homoplasy for each type were measured. No significant differences were found among these categories. The BLH trees were shown to be significantly more congruent with the electrophoretic and 12S sequence trees than expected by chance. This indicates that seabird BLH data contains phylogenetic signal. Areas of incongruence between BLH trees and a phylogeny generated by combining the data sets were predicted to result from ecological constraints that did not covary with phylogeny. These predictions were supported by the results of a concentrated changes test. This study found that this BLH data set was no more homoplasious than molecular data and that BLH trees were significantly congruent with molecular trees.
2055248822	Abstract The effects of multiple stressors on estuarine organisms are not well understood. Using cage experiments we measured the survival and growth of the pulmonate gastropod Amphibola crenata at five locations which differed contaminant levels. Water nutrients came from a nearby sewage treatment works and the sediment contained low levels of trace metals. Over 6 weeks of exposure, sediment surface chlorophyll levels varied amongst locations. The Chl a values were positively correlated with sediment N and P and trace metals As, Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn. Pulmonate survival depended on location, highest mortality was from a site close to the treatment plant and mortality rate of large individuals decreased significantly with distance away from it. For four locations, medium A. crenata had higher survival than small (juveniles) or adults. Growth rates of small individuals exceeded those for medium and large A. crenata. The mean length increment/week for medium gastropods ranged between 0.49 and 1.11 mm and was negatively correlated with the amount of Chl a in the surface sediment, suggesting the negative effects of eutrophication on gastropod growth. Growth rate of the pulmonate was not correlated with nutrient concentration or trace metal concentrations in the sediment. The dry weight condition index (CI) did not correlate with the growth rate, and for medium individuals, was unaffected by any of the environmental variables. The CI of small individuals was negatively affected by increasing water nutrient levels and the CI of large individuals negatively affected by increasing sediment nutrients and trace metal concentrations. The results from this study suggest that gastropod growth and survival could be used as tools to monitor the effects of changing nutrient levels and recovery from eutrophication within temperate estuaries.
2055248823	The hormones which support growth, in vitro, of normal, neonatal human foreskin fibroblasts were determined. Whereas thrombin and hydrocortisone were major growth stimulants, platelet-derived growth factor was not. Human foreskin fibroblasts grew in a serum-free, biochemically defined medium consisting of epidermal growth factor (100 ng/ml), insulin (100 ng/ml), transferrin 10 micrograms/ml), thrombin (1 microgram/ml), ascorbic acid (10 micrograms/ml), and hydrocortisone (5 x 10(-5) M) in a 1:1 mixture of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F-12, supplemented with ovalbumin (1 mg/ml) and trace elements. The growth achieved was comparable to that achieved with 5% fetal bovine serum. Neither platelet-derived growth factor, fibroblast growth factor, nor somatomedin activity increased proliferation. This serum-free medium, designated Defined Medium F, provides a biochemically defined system for growth and limited subcultivation of human foreskin fibroblasts in vitro.
2055248843	Kv2.1 is a major delayed rectifying K+ channel normally localized to highly phosphorylated somatodendritic clusters in neurons. Excitatory stimuli induce calcineurin-dependent dephosphorylation and dispersal of Kv2.1 clusters, with a concomitant hyperpolarizing shift in the channel's activation kinetics. We showed previously that sublethal ischemia, which renders neurons transiently resistant to excitotoxic cell death, can also induce Zn2+-dependent changes in Kv2.1 localization and activation kinetics, suggesting that activity-dependent modifications of Kv2.1 may contribute to cellular adaptive responses to injury. Recently, cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5) was shown to phosphorylate Kv2.1, with pharmacological Cdk5 inhibition being sufficient to decluster channels. In another study, cyclin E1 was found to restrict neuronal Cdk5 kinase activity. We show here that cyclin E1 regulates Kv2.1 cellular localization via inhibition of Cdk5 activity. Expression of cyclin E1 in human embryonic kidney cells prevents Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of Kv2.1, and cyclin E1 overexpression in rat cortical neurons triggers dispersal of Kv2.1 channel clusters. Sublethal ischemia in neurons induces calcineurin-dependent upregulation of cyclin E1 protein expression and cyclin E1-dependent Kv2.1 channel declustering. Importantly, overexpression of cyclin E1 in neurons is sufficient to reduce excitotoxic cell death. These results support a novel role for neuronal cyclin E1 in regulating the phosphorylation status and localization of Kv2.1 channels, a likely component of signaling cascades leading to ischemic preconditioning.
2055248895	Nuclei isolated from embryos of wheat (var. Yamhill) incorporated [3H]UTP into a trichloroacetic acid-insoluble product linearly for 60 minutes. When the RNA synthesized in vitro was analyzed on a sucrose gradient, the amount of RNA in the 4S region increased with longer incubation times. These data and the absence of higher molecular weight RNA of specific size classes in our work (and previously published reports) suggested that nuclear fractions from plant tissue contained active nucleases. This was confirmed when wheat nuclei were mixed with [3H]yeast RNA (4, 18, 26S). All of the radioactive yeast RNA was degraded within 30 minutes to species sedimenting between 4 and 10S. The inclusion of high salt (125 millimolar (NH4)2SO4, 100 millimolar KCl), EGTA, and exogenous RNA or DNA reduced but did not eliminate endogenous RNase activity. Wheat embryo nuclei were further purified by centrifugation on a gradient of a polyvinylpyrrolidone-coated colloidal silica suspension (Percoll). These nuclei were ellipsoidal, free of cytoplasmic material, and lacked endogenous nuclease activity when assayed with [3H]yeast RNA. Sucrose gradients were not as effective as Percoll gradients in purifying nuclei free of RNase activity. The Percoll method of isolating nuclei and the RNase assay reported here will be useful in isolating plant nuclei that are capable of synthesizing distinct RNA species in vitro.
2055248955	Cystic Fibrosis (CF) is an autosomal recessive disease, caused by mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Regulator gene (CFTR). The most frequent mutation in CF is ΔF508. The disease is clinically characterized by elevated concentrations of sweat chlorides and abnormally thick mucus. It affects organs such as lung, pancreas, gastrointestinal and reproductive tract. Women with CF commonly present delayed puberty and amenorrhea due to malnutrition. Our objective was to screen the presence of ΔF508 mutation in 24 women with altered fertility. Nine of these women presented reduced fertility without a known cause, four showed polycystic ovaries and two had early menopause. One woman with early menopause was a carrier of the ΔF508 mutation. Our study demonstrates that it is possible that the frequency of CF mutations among patients with altered fertility may be higher than expected. Previous data showed that fibrocystic women can show reduced fertility, maternal mortality associated with pregnancy and increased incidence of spontaneous abortion. We therefore recommend that women with reduced fertility undertake genetic tests for a better evaluation of pregnancy risks and clinical monitoring.
2055248983	The growth of Schizachyrium scoparium (Michx.) Nash (little bluestem) and Paspalum plicatulum Michx. (brownseed paspalum), two C4 grasses, was examined in monoculture and in mixed culture in three soil depths. Effects of soil depth and competition were both significant. Growth of both species increased as soil depth increased from 30 to 180 cm in pot experiments. However, P. plicatulum dry mass increased approximately four times more than S. scoparium as soil depth increased. Schizachyrium scoparium dry mass was always greater in monoculture while P. plicatulum dry mass was always greater in mixture. Significant interspecific competition was not measured in the shallow soil treatment (30 cm) suggesting equal competition. Significant interspecific competition was measured in the deeper soil treatments (90 and 180 cm), and P. plicatulum dry mass was clearly greater in mixtures in the two deeper soils. Paspalum plicatulum does not appear to prevent the growth of S. scoparium roots in the deeper soil, but seems able to exploit deeper soil resources by proliferating roots at depths where S. scoparium roots do not seem capable of growth.
2055248999	Annexin 2 is a Ca(2+)-binding protein that has an essential role in actin-dependent macropinosome motility. We show here that macropinosome rocketing can be induced by hyperosmotic shock, either alone or synergistically when combined with phorbol ester or pervanadate. Rocketing was blocked by inhibitors of phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase(s), p38 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase, and calcium, suggesting the involvement of phosphoinositide signaling. Since various phosphoinositides are enriched on inwardly mobile vesicles, we examined whether or not annexin 2 binds to any of this class of phospholipid. In liposome sedimentation assays, we show that recombinant annexin 2 binds to phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-4,5P(2)) but not to other poly- and mono-phosphoinositides. The affinity of annexin 2 for PtdIns-4,5P(2) (K(D) approximately 5 microm) is comparable with those reported for a variety of PtdIns-4,5P(2)-binding proteins and is enhanced in the presence of Ca(2+). Although annexin 1 also bound to PtdIns-4,5P(2), annexin 5 did not, indicating that this is not a generic annexin property. To test whether annexin 2 binds to PtdIns-4,5P(2) in vivo, we microinjected rat basophilic leukemia cells stably expressing annexin 2-green fluorescent protein (GFP) with fluorescently tagged antibodies to PtdIns-4,5P(2). Annexin 2-GFP and anti-PtdIns-4,5P(2) IgG co-localize at sites of pinosome formation, and annexin 2-GFP relocalizes to intracellular membranes in Ptk cells microinjected with Arf6Q67L, which has been shown to stimulate PtdIns-4,5P(2) synthesis on pinosomes through activation of phosphatidylinositol 5 kinase. These results establish a novel phospholipid-binding specificity for annexin 2 consistent with a role in mediating the interaction between the macropinosome surface and the polymerized actin tail.
2943224769	Genotype-to-phenotype correlation studies in myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) have been confounded by the age-dependent, tissue-specific and expansion-biased features of somatic mosaicism of the expanded CTG repeat. Previously, we showed that by controlling for the confounding effects of somatic instability to estimate the progenitor allele CTG length in blood DNA, age at onset correlations could be significantly improved. To determine the suitability of saliva DNA as a source for genotyping, we used small pool-PCR to perform a detailed quantitative study of the somatic mutational dynamics of the CTG repeat in saliva and blood DNA from 40 DM1 patients. Notably, the modal allele length in saliva was only moderately higher in saliva and not as large as previously observed in most other tissues. The lower boundary of the allele distribution was also slightly higher in saliva than it was in blood DNA. However, the progenitor allele length estimated in blood explained more of the variation in age at onset than that estimated from saliva. Interestingly, although the modal allele length was slightly higher in saliva, the overall degree of somatic variation was typically lower than in blood DNA, revealing new insights into the tissue-specific dynamics of somatic mosaicism. These data indicate that saliva constitutes an accessible, non-invasive and suitable DNA sample source for performing genetic studies in DM1.
2943224801	In this review the primary strategies employed in compiling a risk assessment for gene flow from a GM crop to a wild crop relative are outlined. A risk is defined as the likelihood of harm resulting from exposure to the hazard. The spread of new genes and genetic exchange between crops and their wild relatives by introgressive hybridization has been a reality ever since the birth of agriculture. The significance of such gene flow has received little interest, however, until the advent of molecular biotechnology and the emergence of genetically modified (GM) crops. In principle, the scope for the transfer of certain, completely novel transgenes from GM crops into wild relatives means that there is an increased capacity for rapid jumps in the adaptation profile of the recipient. This capacity carries risks for the genetic integrity and evolutionary survival of the wild species, and of the survival of other species with which it coexists. In evaluating such potential problems, one must first define the unwanted outcomes (hazards) as clearly as possible, and then measure the likelihood of their occurrence (exposure). The assessment of risk can be compiled (Risk = hazard × exposure). Risk is estimated as the product of the probability of exposure, P ( E ), and the conditional probability of harm given that exposure has occurred, P ( H|E ). That is, R = P ( E ) x P ( H|E ). In measuring risks in this way, it is important to consider the management of the crop, the ecology, demography and population genetics of the wild species, the number, nature and location of the transgene(s) and the extent of introgression within the natural setting. Crucially, these assessments should be made against comparable risks posed by non-GM cultivars of the same crop (i.e. baseline data) so that judgements can be made concerning the significance of any change envisaged.

2943225342	Hearing impairment (HI) is characterized by extensive genetic heterogeneity. To determine the population-specific contribution of known autosomal recessive nonsyndromic (ARNS)HI genes and variants to HI etiology; pathogenic and likely pathogenic (PLP) ARNSHI variants were selected from ClinVar and the Deafness Variation Database and their frequencies were obtained from gnomAD for seven populations. ARNSHI prevalence due to PLP variants varies greatly by population ranging from 96.9 affected per 100,000 individuals for Ashkenazi Jews to 5.2 affected per 100,000 individuals for Africans/African Americans. For Europeans, Finns have the lowest prevalence due to ARNSHI PLP variants with 9.5 affected per 100,000 individuals. For East Asians, Latinos, non-Finish Europeans, and South Asians, ARNSHI prevalence due to PLP variants ranges from 17.1 to 33.7 affected per 100,000 individuals. ARNSHI variants that were previously reported in a single ancestry or family were observed in additional populations, e.g., USH1C p.(Q723*) reported in a Chinese family was the most prevalent pathogenic variant observed in gnomAD for African/African Americans. Variability between populations is due to how extensively ARNSHI has been studied, ARNSHI prevalence and ancestry specific ARNSHI variant architecture which is impacted by population history. Our study demonstrates that additional gene and variant discovery studies are necessary for all populations and particularly for individuals of African ancestry.
2943225372	Marek's disease virus (MDV), an α-herpesvirus targeting avian species, causes fatal Marek's disease (MD) in chickens. The host interferon (IFN) responses play a key role in resisting viral infection. However, host IFN responses following MDV infection in the chicken central immune organs (thymus and bursa of Fabricius), which contain numerous MDV target cells, is poorly understood. In this study, we performed animal experiments in specific pathogen-free chickens infected with two virulent MDV strains (BS/15 and Md5) or without infection as negative controls. Specifically, the type I IFN (IFN-α and IFN-β) transcriptional and proteomic expression levels at 7, 10, 14, 17, and 21 days post infection (dpi) were detected and analyzed. Our results indicated that the mRNA and protein expression levels of IFN-α and IFN-β in the thymus and bursa of Fabricius were mainly downregulated in cytolytic infection (such as 10 dpi) and reactivation (such as 17 dpi) stages, but not the latent (such as 14 dpi) stage of MDV infection, which was determined by comprehensively analyzing the MDV viral load and immune organ damage caused by MDV infection. These data suggest that MDV could inhibit the expression of host type I IFNs, which may be involved in the MDV-induced host immunosuppression and contribute to the immune escape of MDV from host immunity. Furthermore, we found that the downregulated expression of the host type I IFNs induced by BS/15 and Md5 infection was significantly different, which we speculated may be related to the diverse virulence and pathogenicity of MDV strains. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that MDV mostly inhibited the expression of type I IFNs in infected hosts, which may be associated to its pathogenesis.

3149576660	Abstract Plants and viruses coexist in the natural ecosystem for extended periods of time, interacting with each other and even coevolving, maintaining a dynamic balance between plant disease resistance and virus pathogenicity. During virus–host interactions, plants often exhibit abnormal growth and development. However, plants do not passively withstand virus attacks but have evolved sophisticated and effective defense mechanisms to resist, limit, or undermine virus infections. It is widely believed that the initial stage of infection features the most intense interactions between the virus and the host and the greatest variety of activated signal transduction pathways. This review describes the most recent findings in rice antiviral research and discusses a variety of rice antiviral molecular mechanisms, including those based on R genes and recessive resistance, RNA silencing, phytohormone signaling, autophagy and WUS-mediated antiviral immunity. Finally, we discuss the challenges and future prospects of breeding rice for enhanced virus resistance.
2055249051	Over the past few years, regions of genomic imprinting have been identified on a small number of chromosomes through a search for the etiology of various disorders. Distinct phenotypes have been associated with both maternal and paternal uniparental disomy (UPD) for chromosome 14. This observation indicates that there are imprinted genes present on chromosome 14, although none have been identified to date. In order to focus the search for imprinted genes on chromosome 14, we analyzed cases of maternal and paternal UPD 14 and compared them with cases of chromosome 14 deletions. Cases of paternal UPD were compared with maternal deletions and maternal UPD compared with paternal deletions. The paternal UPD anomalies seen in maternal deletion cases allowed us to associate the following features and chromosomal regions: Hirsute forehead: del(14)(q12q13. 3) and del(14)(q32); blepharophimosis: del(14)(q32); small thorax: del(14)(q11.2q13); and joint contractures: del(14)(q11.2q13) and del(14)(q31). Comparison of maternal UPD and paternal deletion cases revealed fleshy nasal tip to be most often associated with del(14)(q32), scoliosis with del(14) (q23q24.2), and del(14)(q32. 11qter) and small size at birth to be associated with del(14)(q11q13) and del(14)(q32). Our study, in conjunction with a prior study of UPD 14 and partial trisomy 14 cases, and what is known of imprinting in regions of mouse chromosomes homologous to human chromosome 14, leads us to conclude that 14q23-q32 is likely an area where imprinted genes may reside.
2055249174	Recombinant antigenic proteins of Toxoplasma gondii are alternative source of antigens which are easily obtainable for serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis. In this study, highly antigenic secretory organellar proteins, dense granular GRA2 and GRA3, rhoptrial ROP2, and micronemal MIC2, were analyzed by bioinformatics approach to express as water-soluble forms of antigenic domains. The transmembrane region and disorder tendency of 4 secretory proteins were predicted to clone the genes into pGEX-4T-1 vector. Recombinant plasmids were transformed into BL21 (DE3) pLysS E. coli, and GST fusion proteins were expressed with IPTG. As a result, GST fusion proteins with GRA225-105, GRA339-138, ROP2324-561, and MIC21-284 domains had respectively higher value of IgG avidity. The rGST-GRA225-105 and rGST-GRA339-138 were soluble, while rGST-ROP2324-561 and rGST-MIC21-284 were not. GRA231-71, intrinsically unstructured domain (IUD) of GRA2, was used as a linker to enhance the solubility. The rGST-GRA231-71-ROP2324-561, a chimeric protein, appeared to be soluble. Moreover, rGST-GRA231-71-MIC21-284 was also soluble and had higher IgG avidity comparing to rGST-MIC21-284. These 4 highly expressed and water-soluble recombinant antigenic proteins may be promising candidates to improve the serodiagnosis of toxoplasmosis in addition to the major surface antigen of SAG1.
2055249260	BACKGROUND: In China, mushrooms are often cultivated on cottonseed hulls, and spent substrates from their cultivation are used as cattle feed. As the area planted to Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cotton in China increases, hulls from transgenic Bt cottonseed are being increasingly used as a substrate for edible mushroom cultivation. The objective of this research was to determine whether Bt toxin was transmitted to mushrooms cultivated on transgenic Bt cottonseed hulls or retained in the spent substrate. RESULTS: Bt toxin was still present in transgenic Bt cottonseed hulls after chemical (carbendazol) treatment but not after heat (100 °C) treatment before mushroom fungus inoculation. When mushroom was cultivated on carbendazol-treated substrates, Bt toxin level in the substrates fell below the detection limit (1.5 ng Cry1Ac per g fresh weight) in 15 days. CONCLUSION: Bt toxin was not transmitted to mushrooms during cultivation on transgenic Bt cottonseed hulls. Copyright © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry
2055249297	A bacitracin-producing strainBacillus licheniformis ATCC 10716 harbors two types of inducible phages (LP52 and DLP 10716). 156 strains re-lysogenized with phage LP52 were independently isolated from a cured strain UM12 ofB. licheniformis. Those strains were divided into 12 groups based on colony morphology and pigment production. Some of the re-lysogenized strains grew faster than UM12 and others produced more bacitracin than the cured strain. For example, the production of bacitracin by one of the relysogenized strains, L89, was enhanced by about 70% in comparison with UM12. The phenotypic variations observed with re-lysogenized strains might be due to the re-insertion of the phage genome at different sites of the chromosome in addition to the pleiotropic effect assumed.

Recent work has exploited more contrived situations that allow these psychologically defined processes to be dissociated, providing insights into their respective neurophysiological correlates.
2055249397	Deletion of the terminal end of 17p is responsible for Miller-Dieker syndrome (MDS), which is characterized by lissencephaly, distinctive facial features, growth deficiency, and intractable seizures. Using microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization, 3 patients with epilepsy were revealed to have genomic copy number aberrations at 17p13.3: a partial LIS1 deletion in a patient with isolated lissencephaly and epilepsy, a triplication of LIS1 in a patient with symptomatic West syndrome, and a terminal deletion of 17p including YWHAE and CRK but not LIS1 in a patient with intractable epilepsy associated with distinctive facial features and growth retardation. In this study, it was suggested that the identified gain or loss of genomic copy numbers within 17p13.3 result in epileptogenesis and that triplication of LIS1 can cause symptomatic West syndrome.

2055249472	Investigation of the cellular distribution of a 105 kDa phosphoprotein (pp 105) in transformed mouse fibroblasts, showed that only a minor amount was located on the surface of logarithmically grown suspension cells. More than 90% of total pp 105 was contained in the cytosolic fraction representing about 0.2% of total cytosolic proteins. Surface and cytosolic pp 105 had identical phosphopeptide patterns. Cytosolic pp 105 was highly purified by ammonium sulfate precipitation followed by three chromatographic steps and gel electrophoresis. The purified pp 105 was capable of weak autophosphorylation. In the stationary growth phase of suspension cells, the amount of pp 105 detectable by endogenous phosphorylation was only 10-15% of that observed during logarithmic growth. pp 105 was also detected in normal mouse tissue and its distribution determined.
2055249494	A morphological study was done on A. nigricans, based on the observation of shell, radula, renal region and genitalia of 50 specimens measuring 18 mm in diameter. The data obtained are to be compared with those recorded in our previous paper (PARAENSE & DESLANDES, 1955) on A. glabratus. The characteristics common to both species will not be mentioned here. The numerals refere to the means and their standard deviations: no special reference being done, they correspond to length measurementes. Shell - 18 mm in diameter, 6.37 ± 0.29 mm in greatest width, 6 whorls. Prevailing colur ferruginous sepia, a minority of olivaceous, ochreous, nigrescent and deeply black specimens being found. Right side variously depressed, umbilicated, 1.5 to 3.5 mm deep from the bottom of the umblicus to the highest level of the last whorl. Left side more depressed than the right one, broadly concave, 1.5 to 3.5 mm deep. Both sides show a varously distinct keel, that looks sharper at the left. Aperture deltoid, varying in outline and width. Body, extended - 60.26 ± 3.62 mm, less pigmented than in glabratus. Renal tube - 30.68 ± 1.69 mm, showing neither ridge nor pigmented line along its ventral surface, this negative character affording a sure means of separation from glabratus. Ovotestis - 14.48 ± 1.93 mm. Ovisperm duct - 13.04 ± 1.60 mm, including the non-unwound seminal vesicle. The latter was 0.97 ± 0,21 mm in greatest width. Carrefour - Resembling that of glabratus. Sperm duct - 21.36 ± 1.53 mm. Prostate - Prostate duct 7.14 ± 0.74 mm, collecting a row of long diverticula numbering 19.6 ± 3.1 and more separate than in glabratus. Last diverticulum generally bifurcate or arborescent, the remaining ones arborescent. Vas deferens - 28.68 ± 1.38. Ratio vas deferens/vergic sac = 6.8±0.8. Verge - 3.08 ± 0.28 mm long, 0.11 ± 0.02 mm wide. Vergic sac - 3.07 ± 0.28 mm long, about 0.20 mm wide. Ratio vergic sac/preputium = 0.84 ± 0.12. Preputium - 3.69 ± 0.47 mm long, 0.85 ± 0.10 mm wide. Albumen gland - Resembling taht of glabratus. Oviduct - 16.26 ± 1.41 mm, swollen at the cephalic end. Uterus - 13.24 ± 1.19 mm. Vagina - 1.70 ± 0.22 mm, swolen at the caudal portion. Spermatheca - 2.78 ± 0.40 mm long, 0.86 ± 0.16 mm wide. Spermathecal duct 1.11 ± 0.20 mm. Radula - 125 to 168 horizontal rows of teeth (mean 153.9 ± 8.4). Radula formula 28-1-28 to 36-1-36 (mean 31.8 ± 1.9). Mode formula 31-1-31. The morphological characteristics of the renal region and shell, and the great body length in the same condition of shell diameter, distinguish A. nigricans from the most related species A. glabratus, giving support to considering it a good species from a txonomic or phenotypic standpoint (morphospecies).
2055249562	Abstract α/β Interferons (IFN) represent one of the first host responses against viral infection. IFN activates a signaling cascade involving multiple genes and pathways leading to the stop of viral replication. However, many viruses have developed mechanisms to overcome this first line of the host defense. We studied the IFN antagonist properties of the NS1 protein of influenza A virus. The NS1 protein is a dsRNA binding protein. Since dsRNAs produced during viral infection are potent activators of the IFN cascade, sequestering of dsRNA by the NS1 protein might prevent the IFN response during influenza virus infection. To test in vivo the anti-IFN activity of NS1, we investigated the biological properties of a recombinant influenza virus lacking the NS1 gene (delNS1). delNS1 virus replication is highly compromised in IFN competent hosts. However, this mutant virus replicates efficiently in IFN deficient hosts. Moreover, infection with delNS1 virus stimulates IFN production by activating NF-κB and IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) transcription factors. DelNS1 virus reacquires virulence and replicates in lungs of PKR −/− mice, also suggesting an important role of NS1 in the inhibition of PKR, an important component of the IFN system. These data underline the importance of NS1-mediated inhibition of IFN activated pathways in the pathogenesis of influenza A virus infection.
3149577079	The invention discloses a corn pollen specific promoter and application thereof. The corn pollen specific promoter has a sequence shown as SEQ ID NO. 1 or a DNA sequence which can be hybridized with the sequence shown as SEQ ID NO. 1 under a strict condition and has promoter activity. The corn pollen specific high-efficiency expression promoter provided by the invention has important application value when a pollen abortion material is created by a genetic engineering means, for example, the promoter sequence is connected with an antisense gene of a gene necessary for pollen development or isconstructed into an RNA interference vector, and the gene necessary for pollen development can be silently expressed in pollen by transforming the RNA interference vector into a plant to generate a pollen abortion plant, so that adverse effects caused by continuous expression of a target gene at other parts are avoided. The invention provides a novel method for driving the target gene to be efficiently and specifically expressed in the pollen by using the promoter, and the method has wide application prospect in the aspects of genetic improvement of plants and research of plant bioreactors.
2943225858	Background Kinases are key modulators in regulating diverse range of cellular activities and are an essential part of the protein-protein interactome. Understanding the interaction of kinases with different substrates and other proteins is vital to decode the cell signaling machinery as well as causative mechanism for disease onset and progression. Objective The objective of this review is to present all studies on the structure and function of few important kinases and highlight the protein-protein interaction (PPI) mechanism of kinases and the kinase specific interactome databases and how such studies could be utilized to develop anticancer drugs. Methods The article is a review of the detailed description of the various domains in kinases that are involved in protein-protein interactions and specific inhibitors developed targeting these PPI domains. Results The review has surfaced in depth the interacting domains in key kinases and their features and the roles of PPI in the human kinome and the various signaling cascades that are involved in certain types of cancer. Conclusion The insight availed into the mechanism of existing peptide inhibitors and peptidomimetics against kinases will pave way for the design and generation of domain specific peptide inhibitors with better productivity and efficiency and the various software and servers available can be of great use for the identification and analysis of protein-protein interactions.
2943226085	Evolution of herbicide resistance in weeds is among the serious challenges that agriculture face today. In Pakistan herbicide use over last 6 decades has enabled earlier planting of short-season crops and improved weed control in wheat as well as other cropping systems. This has greatly favored the use of more and more herbicides. Conversely, this exercise increased the evolution of resistant biotypes. Wheat being Pakistan's number one staple crop faces daunting weeds problem. In order to understand the status of herbicide resistant weeds in wheat fields, survey was conducted for two consecutive years (2015-2017) in different regions of Pakistan. A questionnaire was designed to collect data from three hundred farmers randomly selected in all four provinces of Pakistan on herbicides used in wheat, history of crop cultivation regimes and weed species that have seized to respond to field rates of herbicides. Seed of suspected biotypes were collected from the survey sites and preserved in our gene pool for the confirmation of the resistance in the laboratory by bioassay and molecular level in future. Farmers (96%) perceived that Phalaris minor Retz. was the most important annual weed of wheat crop followed by Avena fatua L. (94%). Customarily, three aryloxyphenoxy propionate herbicides, clodinafop-propargyl, fenoxaprop-P-ethyl and diclofop-methyl were used to control different grass weeds such as P. minor, A. sativa L. and A. fatua. In farmers' opinion, high yield of wheat was associated with the continuous use of these herbicides. Resistance-suspicious weeds were reported from all studied areas (Punjab, KPK, Sindh, and Baluchistan provinces) in fields with the herbicide use history of five to seven years or more. This study suggests that for long-term avoidance of herbicide resistance, in our wheat growing systems we will require embracing practices that decrease selection pressures favoring resistant weeds. Achieving these goals requires an understanding of the evolution and dynamics of resistant populations. It is recommended that for the effective management of resistant populations of P. minor and A. fatua, farmers' education on ecologically sustainable weed management is critically important. This study will provide a basis for examining the questions that are relevant to understanding herbicide resistance evolution in Pakistan and that may help determine appropriate weed management strategies.
2943226184	Cattle farming, as one of the most important branches of livestock production, has long been confronted with the chronic problem of the decline in reproductive performances. In 2005, the number of cattle around the world amounted to about 1,370,000,000 heads of cattle, while in 2012 this number was just over a billion, which indicates the importance of applying different reproductive protocols in order to increase production. Heat stress leads to disorders of the physiological and reproductive processes, as the rise in body temperature caused by heat stress has direct negative consequences on numerous cell functions. The study included a total of 54 Holstein- Friesian cows, 28 experimental and 26 control cows from PD Butmir farm with 5 lactations on average. Hormone protocols for estrus and ovulation were used in June and July 2013. Cows in the experimental group were subjected to a Presynch + 5dCoS2 protocol. Cows that did not conceive after this protocol were immediately subjected to resynchronization with Cosynch -72 protocol. The success rate of the Presynch + 5dCoS2 protocol was 19%, while in the case of Cosynch 72 it was 33%, which was statistically significant (p <0,05). The first presynchronization and synchronization protocol (5dCoS2) did not significantly help to improve the conception rate after the first insemination postpartum, but it is evident that they had a positive effect on another protocol (COS72) in the form of reduction in embryonic mortality in the summer months when embryonic loss is the greatest. The COS72 protocol provides satisfactory results in the summer, but good fitness and health management, as well as heat stress reduction in accordance with the location and farm design are the preconditions for a successful estrus and ovulation synchronization program prior to artificial insemination.
2943226215	Infection with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a common cause of childhood diarrhea in low- and middle-income countries, as well as of diarrhea among travelers to these countries. In children, ETEC strains secreting the heat-stable toxin (ST) are the most pathogenic, and there are ongoing efforts to develop vaccines that target ST. One important challenge for ST vaccine development is to construct immunogens that do not elicit antibodies that cross-react with guanylin and uroguanylin, which are endogenous peptides involved in regulating the activity of the guanylate cyclase-C (GC-C) receptor. We immunized mice with both human ST (STh) and porcine ST (STp) chemically coupled to bovine serum albumin, and the resulting sera neutralized the toxic activities of both STh and STp. This suggests that a vaccine based on either ST variant can confer cross-protection. However, several anti-STh and anti-STp sera cross-reacted with the endogenous peptides, suggesting that the ST sequence must be altered to reduce the risk of unwanted cross-reactivity. Epitope mapping of four monoclonal anti-STh and six anti-STp antibodies, all of which neutralized both STh and STp, revealed that most epitopes appear to have at least one amino acid residue shared with guanylin or uroguanylin. Despite this, only one monoclonal antibody displayed demonstrable cross-reactivity to the endogenous peptides, suggesting that targeted mutations of a limited number of ST residues may be sufficient to obtain a safe ST-based vaccine.
2943226225	Background There are more than 30 peanut cultivars registered in Brazil. However, there are no published data about the content of nutrients and antinutrients even in the most commercially important ones. Therefore, our objective was to characterize commercial peanut cultivars harvested in Brazil by determining proximate and fatty acid composition and content of selected minerals and phytates, saponins and condensed tannins. Results Significant variations were found among the cultivars for almost all studied nutrients, except Mg. Granoleico and IAC 505 were identified as high oleic. Results were compared with data from the Brazilian Food Composition Table (TACO) and, for this, percentage differences (D%) were calculated. Appreciable D% were found for proteins, lipids, ash, dietary fiber, almost all fatty acids (except 20:0) and almost all studied minerals (except zinc). Moreover, remarkable variations in content of antinutrients were observed. IAC Red Tatu had the highest content of saponins; IAC OL3 and IAC 886 had the highest amounts of phytates; and IAC 886 had the highest amounts of condensed tannins. Conclusion Results confirm the relevance of differentiating cultivars in the market and in national food composition tables and databases. Furthermore, some of these cultivars may be indicated for new use trends. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry.
2943226553	Summary Alternative to the conventional search for single-target, single-compound treatments, combination therapies can open entirely new opportunities to fight antibiotic resistance. However, combinatorial complexity prohibits experimental testing of drug combinations on a large scale, and methods to rationally design combination therapies are lagging behind. Here, we developed a combined experimental-computational approach to predict drug-drug interactions using high-throughput metabolomics. The approach was tested on 1,279 pharmacologically diverse drugs applied to the gram-negative bacterium Escherichia coli. Combining our metabolic profiling of drug response with previously generated metabolic and chemogenomic profiles of 3,807 single-gene deletion strains revealed an unexpectedly large space of inhibited gene functions and enabled rational design of drug combinations. This approach is applicable to other therapeutic areas and can unveil unprecedented insights into drug tolerance, side effects, and repurposing. The compendium of drug-associated metabolome profiles is available at  https://zampierigroup.shinyapps.io/EcoPrestMet , providing a valuable resource for the microbiological and pharmacological communities.
3149577533	Aristolochic acid I (AAI) is a potent nephrotoxic and carcinogenic compound produced by plants of the Aristolochiaceae family and thoroughly investigated as a main culprit in the etiology of Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN). So far, the AAI exposure was demonstrated to occur through the consumption of Aristolochia clematitis plants as traditional remedies, and through the contamination of the surrounding environment in endemic areas: soil, food and water contamination. Our study investigated for the first time the level of AAI contamination in 141 soil and vegetable samples from two cultivated gardens in non-endemic areas, A. clematitis being present in only one of the gardens. We developed and validated a simple and sensitive ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-ion trap mass spectrometry method for qualitative and quantitative AAI analysis. The results confirmed the presence of AAI at nanogram levels in soil and vegetable samples collected from the non-endemic garden, where A. clematitis grows. These findings provide additional evidence that the presence of A. clematitis can cause food crops and soil contamination and unveil the pathway through which AAI could move from A. clematitis to other plant species via a common matrix: the soil. Another issue regarding the presence of AAI, in a non-endemic BEN area from Romania, could underlie a more widespread environmental exposure to AAI and explain certain BEN-like cases in areas where BEN has not been initially described.
2055249708	Background Penicillium marneffei is a dimorphic fungus endemic in Southeast Asia. It can cause fatal penicilliosis in humans, particularly in HIV-infected people. Diagnosis of this infection is difficult because its clinical manifestations are not distinctive. Specialized laboratory tests are necessary to establish a definitive diagnosis for successful management. We have demonstrated previously that a cell wall mannoprotein Mp1p, abundant in P. marneffei, is a potential biomarker for diagnosis of P. marneffei infections. In the present study, we describe immunoassays based on Mp1p derived from the yeast Pichia pastoris expression system. Methodology/principal findings We generated monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) and rabbit polyclonal antibodies (PAbs) against Mp1p expressed in P. pastoris. Subsequently, we developed two Mp1p antigen capture ELISAs which employed MAbs for both the capture and detecting antibodies (MAb-MAb pair) or PAbs and MAbs as the capture and detecting antibodies (PAbs-MAb pair) respectively. The two Mp1p antigen ELISAs detected Mp1p specifically in cultures of P. marneffei yeast phase at 37-40°C and had no cross-reaction with other tested pathogenic fungi. The sensitivities and specificities of the two antigen assays were found to be 55% (11/20) and 99.6% (538/540) for MAb-MAb Mp1p ELISA, and 75% (15/20) and 99.4% (537/540) for PAbs-MAb Mp1p ELISA performed using 20 sera with culture-confirmed penicilliosis, and 540 control sera from 15 other mycosis patients and 525 healthy donors. Meanwhile, we also developed an anti-Mp1p IgG antibody ELISA with an evaluated sensitivity of 30% (6/20) and a specificity of 98.5% (532/540) using the same sera. Furthermore, combining the results of Mp1p antigen and antibody detection improved the sensitivity of diagnosis to 100% (20/20). Conclusions/significance Simultaneous detection of antigen and antibody using the immunoassays based on Mp1p derived from P. pastoris greatly improves detection sensitivity. The procedures should be useful for the routine diagnosis of penicilliosis.
2055249832	Chinese hamster ovary cells labelled with [14C]thymidine were made permeable, incubated with various concentrations of the intercalating dye ethidium bromide, and centrifuged through neutral sucrose gradients. The gradient profiles of these cells were qualitatively similar to those obtained by centrifuging DNA from untreated, lysed permeable cells through gradients containing ethidium bromide. The sedimentation distance of DNA had a biphasic dependence on the concentration of ethidium bromide, suggesting that the dye altered the amount of DNA supercoiling in situ. The effect of ethidium bromide intercalation on incorporation of [3H]dTMP into acid-precipitable material in an in vitro DNA synthesis mixture was measured. The incorporation of [3H]dTMP was unaffected by less than 1 microgram/ml of ethidium bromide, enhanced up to two-fold by 1--10 microgram/ml, and inhibited by concentrations greater than 10 micrograms/ml. Alkaline sucrose gradient analysis revealed a higher percentage of small DNA fragments (6--20 S) in the cells treated with 2 micrograms/ml ethidium bromide than in control cells. These fragments attained parental size within the same time as the fragments in control cells. In cells treated with 2 micrograms/ml ethidium bromide, a significant fraction of newly synthesized DNA resulted from new starts, whereas in untreated cells practically none of the newly synthesized DNA resulted from new starts. These results suggest that relaxation of DNA supercoiled structures ahead of the replication fork generates spurious initiations of DNA synthesis and that in intact cells the rate of chain elongation is limited by supercoiled regions ahead of the growing point.
2055249875	To analyse the effects of season and reproductive status on seasonal changes in body composition of female muskoxen (Ovibos moschatus), we examined 196 muskox cows fromVictoria Island, Northwest Territories, Canada, during 16 collections carried out by Inuit hunters in April, May, July, August, September, and November from 1989 to 1993. During this time, the density of muskoxen on the island increased slowly and they numbered about45,000 in 1993. Hunting and predation by wolves (Canis lupus) were limited, and there was little evidence of muskox mortality due to malnutrition. Adult muskox cows ( 4 years old) were leanest in May, when the ingesta-free body weight (IFBW) and estimated fat weight of newly-lactating cows were 116 ± 2 kg (adjusted mean ± S.E.) and 13.7 ± 0.8 kg, respectively, and those of non-lactating cows were 112 ± and 12.2 ± 1.6 kg. These weights peaked in September at 166 ± 4 kg and 37.8± 1.8 kg in lactating cows and 176 ± 7 and 45.1 ± 3.4 kg in non-lactating cows. The most rapid losses of fat (242g/day) and protein (55g/day) occurred i lactating cows in late winter. The weight of ingesta, primarily rumen contents, increase during the year from April (20.9% of body weight) to November (27.8%) and was exceptionally high for ruminants. Seasonal patterns in 2- and 3-year-old females were generally similar to those in older cows, although the younger cows were leaner and weighed less. Pregnancy rates increased from 0 in females 18–23 months old to 25% in cows 30–35 months old and 63% in females 42 months old. Mammary gland weight in lactating females peaked in July and August, suggesting that peak milk production did not occur until at least two months after calving, and lactation was sometimes extended to a year or more. Lactation in November did not preclude pregnancy, but females which were pregnant at this time were fatter and heavier than non-pregnant cows. These results indicate a high-amplitude annual cycle of body reserves in female muskoxen, and suggest a considerable sensitivity of pregnancy rates to nutritional influences.
2055249926	THE plasma membrane of mycoplasmas, like other biological membranes, is built of protein and lipid and possesses several properties which make it an attractive model for membrane studies1. The molecular organization of the protein and lipid in the mycoplasma membrane has been much studied in recent years. Sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) has been shown to solubilize the membrane to separate protein–detergent and lipid–detergent micelles2,3. In spite of the complete separation of the protein from the lipid by SDS, these components could reaggregate spontaneously and form typical triple-layered membranes on removal of the detergent by dialysis against an Mg2+-containing buffer3–5. The re-formed membranes morphologically resembled the original membranes, and contained some of their enzymatic activities which resisted inactivation by the detergent (S. R., Ne'eman and Ohad, to be published). The spontaneous reassociation of solubilized membrane protein and lipid appears to be a general property of biological membranes, for it could be demonstrated with membranes of diverse origin6–9. Closer investigation of this property may disclose the mechanisms governing the assembly of proteins and lipids into membrane structures, and possibly help in the understanding of membrane assembly in vivo. In the course of this investigation the question arose whether the solubilized membrane components of one organism will reaggregate with those of another organism to form a hybrid reaggregate. Because the reaggregate prepared from solubilized Mycoplasma laidlawii membranes was found to have no common antigens with the reaggregate of Mycoplasma gallisepticum membranes, and to differ in its buoyant density, we decided to use these membranes to investigate the specificity problem.
2055249962	High-density lipoprotein (HDL) exists within the brain and is highly vulnerable to oxidative modifications. The focus of the present study was to determine the effect of HDL and oxidized HDL (oxHDL) upon neurons, astrocytes, and microglia. Administration of highly oxidized HDL, but not native, minimally, or moderately modified HDL resulted in a dose- and time-dependent increase in oxidative stress and death of cultured rat embryonic neurons. Astrocyte and microglia cultures treated with highly oxidized HDL displayed increased reactive oxygen species formation but no toxicity. Application of oxHDL exacerbated oxidative stress and neuron death induced by beta-amyloid peptide. Studies using pharmacological inhibitors implicate the involvement of calcium and reactive oxygen species in oxHDL-induced neuronal loss. Neural cells expressing increased levels of BCL-2 had decreased levels of oxidative stress and neuron death following exposure to oxHDL. Together, these data demonstrate that oxHDL increases oxidative stress in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia which ultimately culminate in neuron death.
2055249977	Summary: From a Bacillus subtilis gene bank constructed in Escherichia coli and based on a low copy number cloning vector we have isolated a hybrid plasmid, pSH1047, containing an 8.0 kb segment of B. subtilis DNA coding for the sdhA. B and C genes, which code for the component polypeptides of succinate dehydrogenase, and the gerE gene, which may code for or regulate a protease involved in producing spores which germinate normally. We report the restriction map of this segment and the analysis of deletion derivatives which allow us to correlate the physical and genetic maps of these chromosomal segments.
2055250002	Broodstock of mature Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes Temminck and Schlegel, 1846) (mean weight 0.45 ± 0.03 g; age 6 months) were maintained in glass aquaria (8 males and 8 females in each aquarium). The fish were fed commercial feed (group C) or this feed was supplemented with arachidonic acid ARA (2 % of total fatty acids in feed; group A) and one of the COX inhibitors: resveratrol (group AR) or NS-398 (group ANS) with amount 20 mg kg−1 BW day−1 of one of the COX inhibitors. The effect of 2 weeks of feeding experimental diets on reproductive parameters (fecundity, embryo and larval survival, hatching rate, and larvae body weight) was analyzed. Larvae (obtained from experimental dietary treatments) were reared for 2 weeks. The percent of spawning female and fecundity was similar in dietary treatments. COX inhibitors in broodstock diet caused a decrease in embryo survival rate. Eggs of medaka from group ANS and AR revealed the lowest hatchability rate. In contrast, group A revealed a higher hatchability rate at the same time. Larval body weight after hatching was significantly the highest in this group. At the end of the experiment, larvae body weight ranged from 1.62 ± 0.43 mg in group AN to 2.89 ± 0.74 mg in group A. These results show that the COX inhibitors decreased gamete and larval quality regardless of high levels of ARA in broodstock diet.
2055250030	Peixoto de Azevedo is located in the north of State of Mato Grosso, where environmental alterations led to an outbreak of American cutaneous leishmaniasis in the 80s. The parasite from patients was characterized as Leishmania (V.) braziliensis. The aim of this study is to contribute to the sand fly ecology of Central-West Brazil. Captures were carried out monthly using CDC light traps. Twenty-six species of sand fly were characterized; among which Lutzomyia (Lutzomyia) spathotrichia, L. runoides and L. (Psychodopygus) llanosmartinsi were recorded in the State of Mato Grosso for the first time. L. (Nyssomyia) whitmani, L. (N.) antunesi, L. (L.) spathotrichia, L. (P.) c. carrerai, L. (P.) complexa, L. (P.) lainsoni and L. (N.) umbratilis constituted 92.4% of the local fauna, among which L. (N.) whitmani and L. (N.) antunesi, accounting for about 53% of the fauna at the stations of capture. On the vertical distribution of sand flies on the Beira-Rio Farm, L. (N.) whitmani and L. (N.) antunesi prevailed at ground level and in the canopy, respectively, whereas on the BR-080, L. (P.) llanosmartinsi was prevalent on the ground and L. (P.) c. carrerai, in the canopy. It is suggested that L. (N.) umbratilis is the local vector.
2055250035	Abstract The shorthorn sculpin Myoxocephalus scorpius is a convenient species for monitoring pollution in northern coastal areas. In this study, a series of biomarkers was measured in sculpin collected from four Icelandic harbours differing in size, use and traffic. Eyrarbakki Harbour has been inactive for many years and was chosen as a control site. Njardvik Harbour is a small fishing harbour with a marina; Sandgerdi Harbour is a large fishing harbour; and Reykjavik Harbour is a large fishing harbour and an international transport harbour. Higher levels of DNA-adducts and cytochrome P4501A in fish from Sandgerdi, Njardvik and Reykjavik harbours compared to fish from Eyrarbakki Harbour indicate polycylic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure. This was confirmed by PAH analysis in bile. The higher activity of the antioxidant enzymes catalase, glutathione peroxidase and glutathione reductase in fish from Sandgerdi Harbour compared to fish from other harbours indicates the presence of prooxidative compounds in Sandgerdi Harbour.
2055250042	The immunodominant cryptic epitope SYNTGRFPPL, encoded within open reading frame 2 of the LP-BM5 retroviral gag gene, is critical for protection against retroviral-induced pathogenesis. The goal of this study was to dissect the memory response against this unique immunodominant cryptic epitope. Unlike the protective acute effector population of SYNTGRFPPL-specific CD8 T cells, long-lived SYNTGRFPPL-specific CD8 T cells lacked the ability to protect susceptible mice infected with LP-BM5 retrovirus. Compared to memory CD8 T cells against a conventional epitope with similar MHC-I specificity, primed and restimulated using similar conditions, long-lived SYNTGRFPPL-specific CD8 T cells were impaired in their ability to recall against antigen, with reduced cytolytic capabilities and cytokine production. Since similar priming and restimulation regimes were utilized to generate each effector CD8 T cell population, this study has potentially broad implications with regard to the selection criteria of potent, highly conserved cryptic epitopes for use in epitope-based vaccines.
2055250044	The frequencies of human platelet-specific alloantigens (HPAs) vary between different ethnic groups, and genotyping using DNA techniques has been preferred over immunophenotyping methods for population studies. Using a polymerase chain reaction with allele-specific primers (PCR-ASP) method, we determined the allelic polymorphisms of five HPA systems among 174 unrelated individuals of two different Brazilian ethnic groups including Amazon Indians (n = 95) and blood donors (n = 79). Comparison of the calculated gene frequencies of the two alleles of HPA-1, -2, -3, -4 and -5 systems for Amazon Indians and Brazilian blood donors showed that gene frequencies obtained for the two alleles of HPA-1 (P < 0.001), HPA-2 (P = 0.001) and HPA-5 (P < 0.001) were significantly different between the two groups of individuals. All natives tested carried the HPA-2a and the HPA-5a alleles, but the HPA-1b and HPA-4b alleles are absent from the Indian population. It was also observed that all blood donors carried the HPA-1a, HPA-4a and HPA-5a alleles. In conclusion, the present data indicate differences in the frequency of the HPA systems between Amazon Indians and Brazilian subjects who present a high rate of racial admixture. While the frequencies of the HPA-1 and HPA-5 genes seen in Amazon Indians are similar to those reported for Oriental populations, the frequencies of the HPAs alleles in Brazilian blood donors are comparable to those reported for populations in North America and Europe.
2055250061	Multiple granular cell tumors of the esophagus and the stomach found in a 53-year-old man are reported. One lesion was detected within the lower thoracic esophagus and seven lesions were detected in the stomach. The esophageal tumor was resected endoscopically, and gastrectomy was performed for the multiple gastric lesions. Histologically, the tumors consisted of spindle or polyhedral cells and the cytoplasm contained punctated eosinophilic granules with positive immunohistochemical staining for S-100 protein. The tumors were mainly located in the submucosal layer. Some tumor cells were seen in the mucosae propria and the muscularis propria. The tumor cells were only slightly positive for p53- and Ki-67-immunohistochemical stainings. Based on these findings, we diagnosed the granular cell tumors as benign. Granular cell tumor is comparatively rare in clinical practice, but a few such tumors have been seen in the digestive tract. A few cases of multiple esophagogastric granular cell tumors have also been reported in the literature.
